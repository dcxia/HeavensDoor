Any advice would be appreciated.","[""Is there any pattern to where your destinations will be?

AA has multiple directs in/out of FLL to CLT, DFW, PHL and ORD daily with some seasonal to DCA and LGA. Anything to the west coast can be done from MIA direct if you don’t mind the slog down 95 - otherwise the time you save not driving is made up changing planes in CLT or DFW.  If you can set it up to avoid having to get in or out of MIA near rush hour, the drive isn’t so bad. \n\nIf you go with Delta or United, you are SOL when delays happen. Just last week my JFK-CLT-FLL got cancelled and I got rebooked from JFK-MIA. I would have spent an extra night in NY if I was on Delta or United. \n\nAlso, think in terms of mileage redemption and international travel. I have made many direct trips to Europe/Caribbean/Mexico from MIA on AA (MXP, BCN, LHR, CUN, etc.) where with Delta, you will almost always have to fly through ATL.  Where do you want to go once you get some miles accrued?\n\nThe other option is JetBlue, but only if SFO and NYC/BOS are your primary destinations. \n\nBeware of a fly in the ointment.

The farther east you go, the fewer routes you have available.\n\nUnited is my least preferred carrier.  It seems like most of the fleet is old, the inflight entertainment system is balls, and the way they do seat upgrades for members with status is dumb.

While adding segments does increase your exposure to delays, the stark reality is that travelling that much will result in some level of impact a couple times a year.  Your choice in carrier matters in these situations as not all carriers are created equally.  Premium carriers generally have more options for remediation and treat affected customers better than a budget carrier would.\n\nHere is the other thing to consider.\n\nYou are working on your status for 2020 right now.  Sure you are going to make 2019 status and get the perks, but that doesn't expire until december of 2020.

&#x200B;

I'm looking at an airline to commit to in order to reach elite level status. I currently live in Japan and my company pays for me to fly home once a year and I can usually do business/first class on flights home so I figured I should take advantage of this and collect miles as well as trying to reach elite level status. I plan to go home at least twice a year, maybe 3 times depending on the year. So that's at least 24k - 25k miles flown each year.

&#x200B;

That should get me to at least Delta Silver or AAdvantage Gold each year. And I also plan on applying for one of their credit cards. Whether that be AAvantage Executive or Delta Reserve to help me get extra miles and EQM. Ideally I'd want to reach a status where I could potentionally get upgrades on my personal flghts home. Does Delta Silver or AAdvantage Gold have a good shot at getting upgraded on international flights?

  
What do you guys think is the better program between the two? The one plus for American Airlines is they are partnered with Japan Airlines which I also use quite often for domestic travel around here. But it seems like Delta's Elite status is a little bit easeier to attain with a combination of the card and the flights home.

Booking Delta One ATL-JNB is 60k Virgin Atlantic miles each way, however using the current MR promo brought it down to 94k RT. If you are looking to book this, you will most likely have to jump on booking the outbound flight first as soon as the schedule opens, and then being patient and waiting for the flight home to open up and booking that separate. Once I booked the outbound leg, I was fully prepared for a situation where I would have to fly home using a different strategy so keep that in the back of your mind, as I was a little less flexible with my date to fly home.

When searching to book this, I found that the outbound ATL-JNB leg is easier to find, with 2 J seats opening up on average 3-4 days of the week when looking out exactly 11 months, the JNB-ATL leg for me was a lot more hit or miss, I booked my flight home today and there was more than 4 seats available on Saturday, April 11th, but before that the only availability was the Tuesday prior. Saturday/Sunday seem to have more availability, for booking the outbound I put the flight on hold for 72 hours and waited to make sure I was flying outbound on the best possible day to optimize travel.

I will be positioning from Texas, with a quick 2 hour flight the night prior to keep it safe, and would imagine this would not be a problem for anybody on the east coast, as flights to ATL are around $100 each way. I don’t like using CPP but in this case the total flight cost is in the range of 8-10k USD. Lastly, while the current flights are not delta one suites, when choosing a seat a year in advance it does show that will be the future layout.","[""Also a note on how great this flight is overall- it's one of only 2 current non-stops from the US to South Africa, and there are only 2 other options which stop in Africa.  By far the most flight options are routing through Europe, which adds a minimum 5 hours to your flight time. Also, this flight leaves at a great time at 9 PM- eat soon after takeoff, fall asleep around midnight or so, sleep (hopefully) 8 hours, and then wake up at a normal time, eat some breakfast, and then a couple of hours later you land.

Well it seems that Delta has cancelled the LAX/AMS route entirely. So now my inbound and outbound flights are cancelled, but my intra-europe flights are still there. I have made a bunch of reservations around these dates and I am going to wedding so the dates need to stick and I have about $6000 in reservations. I also booked this 6 months ago.

Been on the phone for hours with Delta and Korean Air (they keep telling me to call the other one). No saver award availability at all. And it seems like Delta won't put me on any of their flights.

I am honestly just expecting Korean Air to just cancel the award booking. And I will probably skip the wedding and the trip entirely.

Anyone have any advice or a course of action?

49,Go for Alaska MVP Gold or Alaska MVP + Delta Silver?,1,c6bh7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c6bh7z/go_for_alaska_mvp_gold_or_alaska_mvp_delta_silver/,10,1561700521.0,"Some background: Its half way through the year and I have hit the 20k mile minimum to achieve Alaska MVP as I primarily fly Alaska out of SEA. If there is a flight I cannot fly on Alaska (non-direct, too expensive, etc), I will fly Delta and have so far this year racked up about 7k MQM's and 1.3MQD's. 

My question for r/awardtravel is whether you would recommend using the remainder of the year to go for Alaska MVP Gold (40k miles) or shift flights to Delta to hit Silver Medallion to have both lowest tier Alaska and Delta status. What's best? 

I expect to be able able to fly enough to hit both options. 

More background: This year as Alaska MVP I have flown on 12 segments and have only been upgraded to premium once so the main perk I have gotten from Alaska is preferred main cabin seating.  It seems like everyone has Alaska MVP when flying to or from SEA and unless you are gold or 75k, getting upgraded is far and few between - especially on busy SEA->SFO, SEA->NYC routes. What are people's experiences with Delta silver flying out of SEA? 

For award travel I primarily target transatlantic flights to Europe. Alaska has Icelandair and Condor, while Delta has itself, KLM, AirFrance, and Virgin Atlantic. So Delta arguably has more partners and more award availability than using Alaska miles despite typically having a higher skymiles rate for those TA flights.","[""Mvp gold. If you want delta silver benefits get one of the delta cc's and pretend your first class upgrades never clear"", 'Not sure based out of Seattle but I love being MVP Gold. I used to fly ABQ-PDX a lot and now fly out of PDX and I am upgraded to first class probably 75% of the time I fly and always at least premium economy. Their 100% mileage boost also really helps fund your mileage account. So far I’ve used Alaska miles to book a trip to Europe in business on Condor and to Asia in first on Cathay. Condor doesn’t get the most raving reviews but it will get you into Europe at a decent redemption. British Airways is another European partner but pretty useless as their taxes and fees are always exorbitantly high.', ""MVP gold get substantially more upgrades than MVP, at least out of CA airports. Alaska miles are worth a huge amount more than Delta, but that's especially true for Asia travel, not Europe. They did recently add Aer Lingus as a redemption partner for 60K for J TATL. At the end of the day there's only middling availability released by KLM and AF to Delta, in my experience -- the bigger difference is that Delta sometimes has sales on flights on their own metal to Europe. \n\nI think the MVP gold upgrade rate + the guest upgrades easily outweigh any delta silver benefits."", 'Go for Alaska MVPG. Get an Amex Plat to get 5x points on all your airfare purchases and transfer those miles to DL if you really want to fly DL. Best of both worlds!', 'Just to give you some DPs, my wife is AS MVP Gold based out of SEA. She gets premium pretty much every time she flies, but first class upgrades have been pretty rare.', ""Thanks for the reply. I have the Amex Delta platinum but I'm actually thinking about cancelling it. 2x on Delta flights is not worth the spend IMO when there are cards like CSR and Amex gold/plat that give you 3-5X points with multiple transfer partners. Companion fare is not a huge draw for me. Some people probably get benefit from this card, just not me. \n\nThe main thing I use it for is the reduced $29 SkyClub rate and sit there for 2 hours and drink beer. Not really worth the $195 AF"", 'The flip side for Delta is they offer a fair amount of direct international stops out of Seattle so accumulating their miles may provide value even as a direct redemption.', 'Very useful. Totally forgot about the new Aer Lingus option. Definitely leaning towards Alaska MVP gold after seeing your response as well as others in this thread. \n\nI believe Alaska has the most direct flights out of SEA which is another draw since I tend to avoid layovers as much as possible. Delta often routes through MSP and DTW flying to smaller east coast airports which is often where I am heading for work.', ""Thanks for the reply. I'm convinced gold is the way to go"", 'But you can transfer MR to Delta. AS miles are so much harder to accumulate, and their award chart is much more reliable (unlike DL’s dynamic stuff).']"

I also have Priority Pass (with restaurant access), so other options would be as follows:

LAX - Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse; Alaska Lounge. (I believe Terminal 1 isn't accessible airside so Rock & Brews is out, and the KAL Lounge and PF Changs won't be open when we're there.)

61,Question about Redeeming Delta Sky Miles for Beverages in the Sky Club,17,b7f847,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/b7f847/question_about_redeeming_delta_sky_miles_for/,20,1554004224.0,"I was in a Sky Club at Hartsfield-Jackson yesterday, and I noticed that they sell bottles of Dom Perignon for $250. That seems pretty standard. That is about 2x the retail price, and that is the pretty standard markup for restaurants that sell a lot of wine. I do not know what the wholesale price is. I'm guessing somewhere between $60 and $80.

&#x200B;

What surprised me is that you also have the option of redeeming 12,500 Skymiles for the same bottle. That is $125 worth of Delta Miles, if you use the pay by miles option. This seems strange to me. You would think that they would prefer people pay cash, and there would be an incentive to pay cash, but they're letting you have the same bottle for half price if you use their proprietary dollars that cannot be spent elsewhere.

&#x200B;

Why would Delta do this? Is it a thing where they are just trying to reward loyal customers who have a lot of Skymiles. Or is it possible that they are trying to get people to redeem their Skymiles for things other than flights, because reward point flights are a big loss leader? I'm really stumped here if anyone is in the know.","['If Delta values their points as 1cpp in their books then 12,500 points is $125. \n\nBuy a bottle for 12,500 points that wholesales at $60, Delta makes $65. \n\nUse 12,500 points for a one way flight that they could sell as a revenue ticket for $200, Delta loses $75. \n\nIf you get someone to buy the bottle, then later they realize they don’t have the points anymore for the 12,500 point flight redemption so they have to buy a revenue ticket, Delta just made money on the flight and the bottle. \n\nIf you can get customers to redeem miles for anything other than flights than Delta is pretty much guaranteed to make a lot more money than they would have otherwise. ', ""Maybe they think people are more impulsive with spending skymiles vs dollars, especially people that have healthy 6 figure + balances. \n\nWriting off Skymiles from their balance sheet when people redeem them is always a good thing since unredeemed miles are a liability from an accounting perspective. I don't know what Delta accounts for skymiles at in their financials, but if you assume 1 cpp, they can remove $125 worth of skymiles at a cash cost of probably half that, using your numbers. \n\nWho knows really. Probably a combination of many of the above."", ""I think it's generally the case that cc companies and airlines really want you to redeem for 1cpp or less. Why do you think Amex has like 90 different ways to use their points other than the transfer partners, or why United has all their shopping portals and stuff. "", 'A bottle of dom Perignon at Costco is usually $140 for reference. ', ""I've wondered the same thing...."", 'FYI is not a Bothe but a glass of Dom for 12,500', 'Well, Skymiles are ""worth"" 1 cpp because that\'s their typical redemption value on flights (so 12,500 miles for a $125 flight is the typical scenario). Further, there\'s no guarantee they sell that seat for a cash rate, so by selling that bottle, Delta guarantees that they\'re out $60 while they possibly wouldn\'t be out anything for the award ticket.\n\nEdit: And if you really believe it\'s correct to assume that a person would have paid cash for the Delta ticket anyway, you also should assume they would have bought the bottle anyway. Thus, Delta would have lost out on $190 in income from the bottle versus $125 for the ticket. It really doesn\'t make sense either way.\n\nI don\'t think it has to ""make sense,"" I would just assume that the bottle is a sweet spot redemption in their award program.', 'Yea but in this case you’re getting 2cpp which is why OP is asking.', 'Yeah, the retail price isn’t of huge consequence. Delta is paying wholesale. 2x or 3x retail is just a quick and dirty way to figure out what a restaurant (also paying wholesale) mark up is for a bottle. I just mentioned for reference that the Sky Club appears to charge 2x retail (ish). ', ""That depends a lot on vintage doesn't it?"", '[deleted]', ""No, it's not.  Glasses are $35 or 1,750 miles.  The 12,500 is for the bottle."", ""> I would just assume that the bottle is a sweet spot redemption in their award program.\n\nIt's a sweet spot, but it still makes little sense in practice. Most people in the Sky Club are just going to select something from the complimentary menu. Someone who is going to forego that to get a bottle of Dom probably doesn't care what a good deal he is getting."", 'I don’t think you understand how economics and statistics work. What he said is the ONlY reason delta sells the bottle for 12.5k points. Don’t try to sound smart on something you have absolutely no idea about.

IDIOT', 'Yeah but not really when the price is inflated in the first place and Delta is really paying an even lower wholesale price anyway. ', ""Exactly this.

I think it's safe to assume that most airlines generally like to make aspirational redemptions better values through their award programs."", 'The vintage wasn’t listed on the menu. Based on the other wines on the menu that I knew, I guessed that the prices were 2x retail price (not the wholesale price they paid, but what the retail cost) across the board. Pretty standard restaurant markup.\n\nAnd it doesn’t matter that much. The real question here pertains to the incentive to use skymiles vs. points.', 'I always stick with the complimentary options. I’ve never paid for a drink in a sky club.', 'Fair. To me, it seems like winning a gift certificate to a bar at trivia. Then the bartender says you can have a Budweiser for $4 cash, but if you want to use your gift certificate balance, I will only deduct $2 for it. I’m sure there are several fallacies in that analogy though. Like I said, it was a real head scratcher.']"

We are in NY and a relaxing mainly beach honeymoon on a nice resort with a what would usually be an out of reach destination is our goal.  We’re both to new to points and award redemption but have aggressively collected points since we got engaged. 

Current Points Summary (I’m using AMEX Gold, CSP and the CFU she’s got a CSP, Freedom and CFU)
140K UR - Her (+20k CFU SUB on the way)
100K UR - me 
70K MR 
19K TYP 

Was hoping to use points for all the airfare and lodging preferably for 10 nights. Been mainly looking at Hyatt to get a solid redemption value. The leader in the clubhouse would probably be the Grand Hyatt in Kauai but would like to go to a second island and not sure if the other Hyatt non Andaz properties would be worth it. We’ve traveled to the Caribbean a few times together and though we haven’t ruled it out we would like to go to a new part of the world for this. 

Still willing to open more cards if necessary such as the world of Hyatt or the Amex green perhaps. Not tied to Hyatt or Hawaii just thought all things considered it fit the bill. Was thinking of using the UR for the hotels and MR+TYP for airfare but everything still tentative. Seems like transferring to Singapore airlines then redeeming with United or Air France may be my best bets for Hawaii.  

Any other ideas on places to go, best ways to redeem points for airfare/resorts, or cards to still get? Still very open to plans just giving my thoughts to this point. Thanks!","['Get more TYP and transfer to Turkish for EWR-HNL nonstop on UA.

Another great option is the Ritz Carlton Residences Waikiki(cat 7). Both can be 50k points/night, cash rates are about $600. I'm not sure if there are still 100k offers open, those offers come and go. You have 2 cards on the Chase side and 2 on Amex side. One card for each of you can get 2 nights at each property, or 5 nights if staying at the same property. Pretty good deal.

Transferring to Hawaiian is probably not worth it, but they do fly out of JFK direct to HNL. You can buy cash tickets and upgrade to lie flat first class for 50k per segment per person. Being that it is your honeymoon, you can do that for one direction for both of you if you do the Amex Green SUB, and take United back in coach for about 25k per person.\n\nedit: the Marriott redemptions I quoted can vary based on dates due to new peak/off-peak pricing.

Alaska 83k
Southwest 62k

My family would LOVE to go to Germany. We can only travel From June 10th through August. We're in San Diego. What are my best options for flights?

Due to work and planned leisure trips I will be flying ALOT in 2019, enough to earn Delta Diamond or United Premier 1k by the end of the year. I currently have Delta Gold (with not much rollover MQMs) which I can easily complete the status match with United on my first few trips. I'm looking for some insight from both elite programs to help me decide!

Home airport: BDL (so neither United/Delta hub, both fly there and prices for each are pretty cheap). Also an easy train ride to NYC

Planned trips
-Domestic flights 3x a month (everywhere, both United and Delta Hubs) 

-London and Shanghai in March

-Sydney in June

-RTW trip using Amex MR points in July-Aug for vacation (exploring mainly SEA)

Right now I have 100k+ miles from Delta, but the Star Alliance network seems so much better from what I heard. Also, I have Amex platinum which gives me Delta lounge with domestic flights, but honestly I find escape lounges/PP restaurants better anyways. 

Would love to hear opinions!","['As an NYC based United 1K and Delta Plat - complimentary upgrades on Delta were 100% this year  (11 flights) VS 0% on United!!\n\nThat said for international travel - Delta is mediocre. UA has the better lounge system at EWR (for your London flights) and additionally at all the 3 “gateways” to Australia (IAH, LAX, SFO) \n\nYou get 6 global upgrade certs with UA (more usable on Asia flights) vs. 4 global with DL (more economical on cheap EU flights) but the ones with UA require a higher coach fare (at least W class) \n\nUA’s certs can also be applied on a business class fare on LH or NH to fly first class!! And LH First Class is one of the very best out there (out of the 10 odd that I’ve tried) \n\nDelta service is better overall, but their miles are meaningless unless used for coach travel or premium travel not touching the USA or if booked months in advance. \n\nAll things said if I had to pick one based on your pattern and plan, given you have 3 intl trips, I’d lean UA!\n\nEdit: Added ‘global’ on the upgrade certs phrase.', ""I would argue that United miles are massively more usable.\n\nIf you're planning to fly business class to Shanghai or London, United's business class *suuuuuucks*. Like, I mean it stinks on ice. 8-across, zero privacy, arguably the single worst business-class product of any major airline. \n\nIf you think you'll be fine on United required spend, and since you've got to fly short-hop-long-hop anyway, then you could absolutely connect through Air Canada's direct services to London and Shanghai, with a considerably nicer pod product.\n"", 'I believe Star Alliance (United) has better coverage in Asia (ANA, Singapore Airlines, China Airlines, etc.) and also South America (Avianca, Copa) and Europe in case you need it (Lufthansa). They also have Gold Tracks at selected airports which helps expedite security and customs if you’re not flying business already. Same with lounge access.\n\nI would only be mindful about booking the correct fare class to make sure you get a nice mileage accrual.

They have a great partnership going. The VA lounge in LHR is fantastic. I always seem to have great VA experiences. \n\nFor Shanghai: book direct with Delta with connections in SEA or LAX.

82,Is Amex Platinum worth it purely for Centurion Lounges?,33,croqw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/croqw8/is_amex_platinum_worth_it_purely_for_centurion/,115,1566089999.0,"Planning my next card, it's a toss up between CSR and amex plat for me.

Basically everything I'm reading indicates CSR is the better overall package with easy to use perks and points that go farther. I just got the ink too so those will work together well.

But, I have a couple of big trips firing off in December and do plan on travelling a decent amount the next year (potential trip to Asia and a small handful of domestic trips using companion pass). My home airport is SJC but I will occasionally be flying out of SFO, especially for international.

I use Uber monthly and know how to squeeze the $400 out of the airline credit (the once every calendar year still applies correct?), so I'm not concerned about getting back the AF. It mostly comes down to benefits for me. 

The centurion Lounges are really, really appealing to me, and I think it might be especially nice for my first big international trip to London into the new year to make it a little more special. Whenever I do fly home it also does tend to be Delta, so getting lounge access there is appealing too. I also like (and have used before with gold) the free roadside assistance.

However CSR isn't going to have a nerfed priority pass and gives true primary rental insurance and trip insurance. I don't rent cars often but I am planning to for my London trip. Plus it's easier to just get hard value out of the AF and points. It seems silly to want the platinum just for Centurion, since overall CSR would be the better card, right? But a solid lounge experience is something I actually would like and I do have access to centurion from my local airport and airports I often travel to/from when visiting friends/family.

Thoughts?","[""Back when the Centurion Lounges opened they were amazing. I'm sure they still are, but now all I read is that they are really crowded all the time. But the Delta lounge access could be a nice backup (assuming you fly Delta a lot)"", ""Personally, I value Amex points more than Chase points for international flights. Chase has United, but Amex has Lifemiles, Etihad and Aeroplan to provide good or better value. Especially with United's recent changes. Transfers to Hyatt is really where Chase shines, or if you're using points for domestic flights imo.\n\nAs for the lounges, I've only heard good things about them tbh, the biggest complaint being they can be busy, which can happen at any lounge. You also get Delta SkyClub access if you're flying Delta. Plus you get hotel status with Hilton and Marriott, which can be rewarding in Asia especially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I should mention, airline gift cards don't count anymore, in case that was part of your plan. That can change the value proposition. Also, the CSR is the better overall card, if you're not willing to invest in getting the Gold card for example."", ""If you're under 5/24 stick to Chase.  If you really want the platinum, consider the biz platinum to stay under 5/24, or get the Sapphire preferred and then shortly after get the personal platinum.\n\nI personally value each Centurion longe visits at the $30-40 mark.  If you regularly fly biz/first you also have to consider reduced lounge use due to that.  That said, I've been trying to churn through Platinums to maintain the lounge access and do not keep a premium Chase card around at the moment."", 'Why not just do both?', 'I have had the Amex Platinum for 5+ years now and will probably get rid of it for the CSR. The centurion lounges are available in places where I have access to other lounges. I also fly out of airports with restaurants that participate in PP so it would be nice to eat at those places again since Amex killed that feature.\n\nThe airline fee credit gets watered down every year. I fly AA and don’t have much to spend it on besides the mileage multiplier which is hit or miss on reimbursement.\n\nThe Uber credit doesn’t roll over so when I’m abroad it just gets wasted.\n\nThe $550 fee is a lower value for me every year.\n\nPrimary rental car insurance is something I’d appreciate on the CSR.', 'Not without a signup bonus.

I have about 10+ visits a year, and when bringing in guests, the free food and drinks is definitely worth it. I've never been turned away because it was too crowded, and I've never not found a seat, even if it meant squeezing in a little. All of this is at SFO. I pretty much make use of all the credits I get from pretty heavily, so I consider it a net positive.\n\nIf you think you would only use their lounges a handful of times a year, I'd go with the CSR."", 'Went to SEA-TAC and went to delta sky lounge.

Flying 15+ round trips a year and having a few drinks on my dime (work pays for meals) sitting at bars is worth it. That covers all my drinks when a lounge is open. I fly Delta enough to so I get to those lounges as well which are everywhere and is a great perk because they are typically much bigger and less packed. 2-3 drinks at a bar is $40. That's $600 a year just for a couple rounds every trip. Plus Uber credits, plus airline credits. I actually have a net gain on the card. Centurion lounges are always packed though which sucks sometimes but bars are always packed as well. I'll sit for a few drinks and possibly a meal then go to my gate. I'm a cheap ass but paying the fee is great for people who travel often money wise. If you don't Uber you can use Uber eats. If I'm flying on vacation taking the wife to the lounge saves me a ton of money since I dish out for drinks and meals for 2."", ""Used to have AMEX platinum and the lounges are so much better than anything else (unless you're in the 1st class lounges, especially LAX).

For our domestic flights we fly out of Oakland, and the escape lounge, available through Amex is great.  For the increasing number of airports with restaurant priority pass members, the CSR is now more valuable, so if you are flying a lot to places like Portland, I would recommend the CSR.', 'TBH, I have kept my platinum card largely for the lounge access. Between $200/yr in southwest airlines gift certificates and $200/yr Uber credits (which I always use), centurion lounge access is worth $150/yr.\n\nGold status with Marriott (Bonvoy), Hilton, and Hertz, plus the platinum discount for Hertz are gravy.', ""I think Centurion lounges are pretty nice and often seem less crowded.

I travel quite a bit out of the states and primarily fly out of O’Hare. I ended up going with CSR because it easily pays for itself and is less of a headache to just use that one card everywhere Visa is accepted.\n\nYou’re asking the right question about lounge access. If that’s worth $150-$550 per year for you then you can get that card and just make sure you use your platinum card to book all your flights.', 'Before, yes.  They weren’t crowded, you could always find a seat, and they were a higher quality.  Now, overcrowding and access restrictions removes the allure of the lounge', ""First of all, the Centurion lounges are fantastic. They blow PP lounges out of the water. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure that Amex plat is worth it outside of a scenario where you know that you'll be flying heavily on routes that include Centurion lounges on layovers (as departure only access has been limited to only 3 hours before your flight boards). This is a slightly easier decision if you know you'll be able to utilize their hotel rewards as well. As other people have mentioned, Amex Plat also gets its best rewards for trips to/from/within Asia. \n\nIn my opinion the Amex plat is a fringe case card.

Restaurants don't count as travel. But hotels, uber, car rental, flights etc. all do. Amex gives a 200 airline credit. This means once a year VISA will automatically reimburse me 300 for any travel, and also my company will reimburse me for the same charges. This completely wipes out the annual fee and I end up ahead. It's not a whole lot but that makes me smile a little. If you were to do the same for Amex you would still would have a fee even after the reimbursements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere CSR really shines for me is car rentals. Complimentary Executive status with National. This doesn't set you ahead of Amex as it's basically the same for them as well. But where this really gets me going is VISA Signature has a contract deal with Silvercar and it's 20 percent off rentals. So rather than go down the executive isle and grab a stupid SUV for the price of a Camry, I can go over to Silvercar and get an Audi for less than it costs for that same Camry at National and the other competing rental companies. When I can't grab a Silvercar I just use National. I'm a car guy though so driving an Audi while on work trips speaks to me more than maybe some others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConcierge service is a toss up between the two. Some people really like Amex, some like Visa. Lounges I think Amex has the better options. As with CSR it's just Priority Pass. But I really don't go to lounges that much so I really don't care a whole lot about that. Priority Pass is fine with me and I can get select discounted restaurant charges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmex does give you 5x points but only on specific travel purchases. Hotels have to be prepaid and paid through Amextravel, Whereas Visa it's 3x any travel purchases and restaurants. That means more to me due to frequent work travel. And I almost never prepay hotels. I mostly fly Alaska Airlines and have been putting flights on my Alaska Visa and everything else on CSR. But considering they're both 3x points, and CSR points actually do go further than Alaska through their Portal last time I checked, I'm considering just purchasing flights on the CSR anyway to keep it all in one place."", ""I don't think any lounge acess is worth $550 the Amex reimbursement of fees is really obscure unlike the Sapphire Reserve as well."", 'Centurion lounges are far and few in between.

Do you already have a Membership reward earning card from Amex? Then I would suggest going for Platinum since you can combine the points with your existing account and redeem them.\n2. Did you get the Amex 100k targeted offer? If yes then it easily outweighs the CSR.\n3. What's your credit score? It is easier to get Amex plat than CSR.\n4. Do you value perks? So you automatically get Hilton Gold and Mariott Bonvoy Gold Elite status which you can use for Status matching to other chains as well (I have done Caesars Diamond, Wyndham Diamond and  Radisson Gold till date) and also to National Emerald club Executive Elite (you only get Executive with Amex)\n5. Do you plan to use the Concierge services ? I have limited experience with them but from Data Points around they have better service the one CSR has\n6. Are you going to use the TSA pre/Global Entry fee reimbursement? I know it's available for CSR as well but for Amex you can have upto 3 Gold Authorized Users for free each of whom can have the fees reimbursed. So you can have $400 reimbursed.

After a friend kept bugging me to visit Sao Paulo, I figured with the time I have due to unemployment, why the hell not. Also a perfect excuse to visit Easter Island.




| Location/Flights |Points/Cash | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
JFK-GRU Y | 25.7k Avios & $5 | Didn't want to use my AA stash so I went with Avios instead.
Intercontinental Sao Paulo | 45k IHG points, 3 nights | At only 15k IHG points a night, I thought this hotel was a steal. Perfect location in Sao Paulo right below Paulista Ave.
Grand Hyatt Sao Paulo|15k Hyatt | IC Sao Paulo did not have availability for my last night so I booked GH for my last night. This location was not ideal at all but the hotel is very modern. Close by the business district. Definitely need a car to get around the area.
GRU-EZE-SCL Y| 12.5k Delta Miles & $29 | I needed to find my way over to Santiago, Chile. Ideally I would've love to take Q Suites's fifth freedom but no availability. LATAM's schedule did not work for me. Out of curiously I did a Delta search and found seats on Aerolíneas Argentinas.
Hostal Forestal | $13, 1 Night | Booked a hostel for one night in Santiago. Highly recommend this hostel if you're a solo backpacker. Not a party hostel at all. Great staff and location.
SCL-IPC RT Y | 26k Merrill Points | I held on to my Merrill points for redemptions like these. I lucked out and found a LATAM flight for a 3 day stay for a little over $500. Of course I did not want to pay cash and Merrill+ took care of this flight for me.
Hotel Taha Tai - Easter Island | 29k UR Portal, 2 Nights | With no points hotel on the island, I opted to use the UR portal. Hotel was very close to the airport and a 5-10min walk to town. Decent hotel. Only compliant is that there was no hot water during the day. Maybe everyone used it all? Hot water was good to go later in the night and early morning.
Hostal Forestal | $20, 2 Nights | Came back to this hostel for 2 more nights after Easter Island. I enjoyed the people here. Good walking distances to restaurants.
SCL-MIA-JFK | 37.k AA miles & $125 | Flight home

**Notes**

• I did not expect Sao Paulo to be an expansive city. Everything was so spread out. Nightlife is amazing here. Need to learn some Portuguese.


• Easter Island was on my travel list for awhile, figured it'd be the perfect excuse to hit since I was down in South America. It is as expensive as they say. Spent an average of $35 for one drink and entree for dinner.


• I did not book any tours for Easter Island a head of time. Figured lets wing this and book something when I arrive. I lucked out on a taxi driver at the airport. Gave me his number and a good price for a full day tour. Sunrise and sunsets are gorgeous on this island.

• Spent a total of 2 nights, 3 days on Easter Island. Hit all the highlights on my first full day and that was enough for me. I think 3 full days is more than enough. If you like hiking maybe a day more. Great hospitality by everyone.


• Seeing the Andes mountains as the backdrop in Santiago was amazing. As a city kid who doesn't go out to nature often, it was a beautiful sight.

95,Europe flights with Ultimate Rewards,2,dllio1,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/dllio1/europe_flights_with_ultimate_rewards/,16,1571795315.0,"EDIT: TL;DR: What's the best use of 200,000 UR points for two people for economy flights to Europe in July 2020? ATL to London or Paris, return from other city to ATL.

I have about 200,000 UR points. Home airport is ATL and traveling to London or Paris and returning to ATL from the other city in early July 2020. Trip will be for about two weeks. My wife and I. Prefer to fly economy to save money for dining and lodging.

Best value for my UR points right now looks to be early July ATL to CDG on Virgin (Delta operated flight, main cabin), 30,000 Virgin points (per person) plus plus nominal $5 fee. Return LHR to ATL mid July for 22,500 Virgin points (per person)plus about $260 in fees (per person). About $800 total RT, considering UR points transfer 1:1 to Virgin Flying Club.

Is this a great deal? Should I book soon? Or are there other options I should consider to maximize my UR points? Air France was another option with Flying Blue 1:1 transfer.

And am I missing something here with the added Virgin fees after points? No hidden surcharges or fuel fees?","['$800 in taxes for economy Europe round trip is usually more than a cash trip. \n\nI would just book through the portal or look at United for the excursionist perk.', ""Flip the order- arrive at LHR and depart from CDG, if available.

96,Booked Etihad flight from MAA-CDG using AAdvantage points on aa.com and Etihad charged $960 for one checked bag.,48,cwr4wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cwr4wv/booked_etihad_flight_from_maacdg_using_aadvantage/,25,1567056378.0,"I booked an award ticket for my brother in July to fly this August from MAA (Chennai, India) to CDG (Paris, France). The ticket itself cost 20k points and a few $. But when he showed up at the check-in counter, they informed him that the ticket does not include a checked bag, and that he would have to pay extra for it. And then they quoted him $960 for it. He is going to France to study. So he was scared and paid whatever they asked.

I feel like this is an exorbitant amount for one checked bag. When I called American airlines, since they issued the ticket, they told me to got to Etihad since they ran the flights and Etihad redirected me to American saying they issued the ticket. So I was being bounced around all day.

Usually international flights come with atleast one checked bag as far as i know. Even when I was talking to Etihad they told me that usually the ticket should come with one checked bag but it doesnt in this case which ""could"" be an error, and if it is it would be on the American airlines side since they issued the ticket. When I told this to the American rep and supervisor, they told me that since the flight doesn't start or end in USA, Etihad is free to charge how much ever they want for a checked bag. I am going to give Etihad another call and see, But I would like to get some tips on how I can proceed with trying to get back atleast some of the money paid for the baggage fee.

In other words pretty much everywhere except S. America. In my opinion, the service on United and our ability to use earned upgrades is pretty poor. I’m being benevolent. Question for those in the know: 

Which is the better option for top tier? AA or Delta? 

The things that matter to me (and maybe others) most are: (1) Service: Starting from booking right through to the gate and on the flight. (2) Ability to use upgrades earned for at least ‘J’ flights on descent aircraft. (3) On-time departures and arrivals.

Thank you so much for your feedback!

American barely wins that one.\n\nBeing able to upgrade depends on your specific market(s). If you're at an AA or Delta hub, even top status probably won't win you too many upgrades.

Delta flies a 767-300 on SEA-CDG... but on AMS-SEA they have 2x daily, one the 767 and the other the A330.  From what I've read, the seats are very different and the Delta One product is superior on the A330, so I would prefer to be on that flight for the AMS return to at least try the other seat.

Virgin Atlantic is showing scattered availability for AMS-SEA, sometimes on the 767 flight, sometimes on A330, or both depending on the date.

TL;DR at bottom :)


**Background**

We planned to fly from MCO to CDG, spend a few days there, then take a cruise that ended in Copenhagen and fly back to Orlando. Because of the cruise, we had pretty firm dates on flying there and flying back.


**Points**

\~197K Delta SkyMiles (across 2 accounts; 147K/50K)

\~236K Marriott Bonvoy (all in 1 account) + 1 Free Night Cert

\~210K Chase UR (not used - all still available!)

&#x200B;

**Travel**

So because our Delta SkyMiles were spread out over 2 different accounts, we ended up both booking a portion of the trip on our individual accounts. We were diligent to book the flights a little less than one year out, which meant best award availability.


* **MCO - JFK (round trip)**: booked on 50K account, 23.5K Delta SkyMiles per person (comfort+). At time of booking, flight was $389.60 for a valuation of 1.66 vs. TPG valuation of 1.2. Horray!


* **JFK - CDG; CPH - JFK (multi-city):** booked on 147K account, 59K Delta SkyMiles per person (comfort+). At time of booking, flight was $1,028.33 for a valuation of 1.74 vs. TPG valuation of 1.2. Horray!


**Hotels**

Overall, needed 3 nights in Paris (specific dates) and one night in Copenhagen (specific date). For Paris, ended up booking 3 nights at a Cat 4. At time of booking, hotel was $231.00 but paid 25K/night for a valuation of 0.924 vs. TPG valuation of 0.8. Horray!


For Copenhagen, ended up booking 1 night at a Cat 5 and used the free night cert (35K). At time of booking, hotel was $411.00 for a valuation of 1.17 vs. TPG valuation of 0.8. Horray!


**Overall**

Ended up burning through most of 50K skymiles from one account and 118K from the other account while still being able to keep \~30K miles. Additionally, only spent 75K bonvoy points at a great value and still have 161K available. Also, didn't have to touch our 210K UR points... but they're burning a hole in our pockets!

I'm planning a ATL-ICN trip for my family of 4., kids are 5 years old and 8 month old..

I spot 50K/ non-stop economy ticket to Korea for 4/25-5/6, red eye flights, which is perfect since my kids will sleep through the most of flight.

I have just enough MR and Skymiles to book 3x economy tickets.

I could get 40K more if I drain all my hotel points, but I do need hotels.

I'm thinking about amping my MS to get enough points to upgrade my seat to premium select. Or, I might be able to get 50K Amex Gold.

As of now, the flight is about 30% booked. Would it be safe to take extra 2-4 weeks to get about 50-60K more miles?

Do I have a chance of getting upgrade with normal main cabin (N) tickets?

As a family of 4, would I have a good chance of getting upgrade to Delta One?

If I can get enough points, would I be better off getting 4x economy vs. 3x premium select?

I can book basic economy with Skymiles for 12,000, Main Economy for 15,000 Skymiles, or domestic first for 21,500.  Same flight is available on VS website for 12,500 VS for economy or 22,500 VS for First.

140,3rd RTW trip,5,dencn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/dencn0/3rd_rtw_trip/,6,1570500984.0,"Just read an older post on the ANA RTW fare and thought I would add my experiences.  In 2015 we did an RTW ticket with Delta right before they disappeared.  We paid virtually nothing in taxes (those were the days).  In 2017 we did an RTW with United, again right before it disappeared.  Our taxes were negligible and in both cases we flew business and first class.  First trip we were gone 70 days second trip gone 50 days.  This third trip is 70 days.

2019 RTW booked with Korean Air.  Yes it is frustrating trying to figure out all the little rules and regulations for each ticket and takes a number of phone calls but it is worth it each time you learn a little more to book with.  For example when Delta booked us in 2015 they could book us back tracking if that was what was available for flights and those legs did not count against us.  However with Korean air you can back track within regions, but legs are strictly limited and legs within regions are also limited.  So we augmented 2 legs on our own to make it work.

The bold are our stops, the taxes were high, $2500, but they are business/first awards.  Would have been less if I could have managed the metal better, but in 2015 the RTW included Seoul so we didn't want to go back.  We each signed up for Korean air visa cards and transferred points that we had.  

I strongly recommend the RTW, this is 220,000 miles again business/first.  It is hard to book point to point award travel for that level of miles.","[""When you say stop, you're using the correct definition of over 24 hours right?

* Travel must be completed roundtrip by December 31st, 2018.
* Must stay three nights minimum.
* Destination must be lower 48 USA only; can originate from Alaska/Hawaii.

Please PM me, and we can work out details.

EDIT: I've had a few interested folks and I wanted to share some of the disclaimers here with anyone else interested:

* Since availability isn't guaranteed for everyone, I'll work with multiple people, and it'll be the first flights that can be confirmed booked and paid for.
* We'll have to share some personal info with each other (full names, contact info, etc.) for booking.
* I have to book for you using the Delta AMEX, so payment will be required via Venmo/Paypal/Zelle/etc.
* If you have dates and a origin/destination ready, I can run some searches for the valid fares and send you screenshots.
* I'm more than happy to have a web meeting to show the search in action on my browser. I can host via Zoom.us or TeamViewer.

# EDIT 2: As much as I like you all, you must supply your own companion. The value of the pass is for you and one other person to fly for basically half price.","['Just an FYI I believe the payment has to go on your delta card in full, so they will have to pay you.', 'would totally take you up on this if we had a few more dollars saved up.

Well, no update showing luggage was loaded in the plane and Delta CSR requested to put the luggage to the 11 AM flight around 8:30 AM this morning.

The technology will be available from “curb to gate,” including at self-service kiosks for check-in, baggage counters, TSA security checkpoints and boarding. International travelers arriving in the U.S. can also use facial recognition during Customs processing.

I am in a conundrum on redemption hell - I'm looking for best overall value/sweet spot help for my trip to Costa Rica for myself and my wife in October leaving CVG.

We have Delta Pesos and Chase UR to play with here.

Dates we're looking at ideally are Wed 2nd - Tues 8th but can flex a day here or there.

&#x200B;

So far I have - Delta 47k RT  CVG through ATL

American Airlines has 25k RT through Miami (overnight on way back in MIA - thats ok)

American Airlines also has MIA - LIR available through British Airways at 15k RT!!!

&#x200B;

So seemingly provided we can position to Miami, 15k pp is a great value for a $900 or so cash flight (prob $600 from there). I've seen that flight on Avios and can book. However I can't see anything on BA for the CVG - LIR or even CVG to MIA... Ideally we'd book it point-to-point.. Is there any way to be creative here. We can't book direct on the AA as we don't have enough points to straight claim the 25k RT.

&#x200B;

Therefore should we a) take the Delta 47k, b) position to Miami (ideas?!) or c) how can we find a way to book AA CVG - LIR

&#x200B;

All of this discounts United who best I could find was 80k RT.

&#x200B;

Thanks!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I found on BA if I booked 2x one ways I could get CVG - LIR for 15k and LIR to MIA for 7.5k just leaving the purchase of one leg of MIA - CVG

  
EDIT: I found the MIA - CVG as a one way also - 7.5k so total for the entire RT 30k Avios",[]

My wife and I are flying to Denver from Detroit (DTW) in June for my sister's wedding.  We are going from June 19th-23rd, and I have the following points:
130k+ MR
100k+ UR

I would like us to do Comfort+ at least, as I am 6'3"" and my wife is 5'11"", so legroom is something I am fine throwing more points at.

Delta website is telling me about 90k points for our two tickets for round trip using their currency.  Virgin Atlantic portal doesn't give me Comfort+, it doesn't seem, when I do Premium it says no results.  So if I step up to First Class, that also looks to be 90k points for our two tickets.

Any other ideas/suggestions on moving forward?  Does that seem like way too much point spend for our flight plan?

I know sometimes flights get cheaper as you get closer to the date, but not sure if that included award points, especially with Delta who I know isn't the best value in most cases.

I just really want non-stop, and much like the leg room, am willing to pay a bit more for it.  But still open to suggestions if someone shows how I can get a good legroom flight for 20k points but one stop or something. :)

I would like to plan a mileage run in early December that would earn 14,000 MQM and 1,300 MQD.  I am based out of CMH.  By using the Delta website and looking at their earnings calculator, the best flight I can find is CMH-PVG in Premium Select and that comes to 22,412 MQM, 1630 MQD, for a price of $1,721.03.  I Also looked at CMH-NRT in Comfort Plus but it was about $100 short on MQD.

The CMH-PVG flight is way more MQM than I need and several hundred more MQD than I need, and I would prefer not to fly across the Pacific if at all possible (like I would rather fly a shorter distance and pay a bit more if necessary).

166,(Relatively) Frequent transcon Flyer out of JFK debating status - worth it at my level?,2,d7yn3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/d7yn3r/relatively_frequent_transcon_flyer_out_of_jfk/,13,1569225533.0,"I've been flying for business more frequently for a little over a year now and reflecting on the numbers, I'm wondering whether I should more seriously pursue some level of status with an airline for 2020 (I got geeky and made an Airtable base to track flight mileage).

I didn't take it too seriously before and have mostly flown JetBlue because I don't/didn't think I'd fly enough to get any worthwhile status on another airline, but am reconsidering and would love some thoughts from the group here. I really like their product and service all around and the frequency/timing of direct flights from JFK to the west coast, but realizing even if I hit Mosaic status, it's not really helpful as you don't get upgrades with it, and with no alliance/without many partners, I mainly get more JetBlue flights.

I also have heard from many people (and here) that since there are so many hardcore business flyers out of JFK, the odds of getting regular upgrades on my routes at a lower tier of status are pretty slim. Would consider opening another credit card to speed up/amplify benefits/miles earned. Currently use my CSR for everything.

My priority is to make my primary travel (to the West Coast) as comfortable as possible, but miles and upgrades for my vacations and other trips would be a nice bonus, just not sure I'll get any of them. I like JetBlue & Alaska (experiences, product, companies), am indifferent to AA/Delta, and despise United (plus don't want to be stuck with everything being out of EWR).

I like Delta's ~~transfer partners~~ alliance a bit more and my recent research makes me think I'd do okay with them. How's the product on the transcon flights on the 757? Would I actually \_get\_ any upgrades with Delta gold? (Maybe could even squeeze out Platinum if I shifted some of my other travel).

Thoughts?

Stats:

* I'm based in NYC, my preferred airport (by a long stretch) is JFK.
* Generally, I fly to the West Coast (SFO or LAX) for work at least 6 times a year, as well as various other ad hoc trips. Most domestic, but occassional international popping up as well. I'd generally be in Premium Economy but can sometimes get Business Class fares in my range.
* For personal travel, my future MIL is based in LA, so we usually go out there at least 2 more times a year. Plus other trips/vacations (3-4 times a year, sometimes domestic, sometimes international- South America and Europe recently and the near future).
* I'm on track to fly a little over 55k miles this year, likely the same or more next year as well.","['You should scope Alaska. Based on your mileage, you’d be at least mvp gold which would get you upgrades to first class at least 30% of the time I would guess? Plus people flying with you would get those upgrades too. Their international partners are solid and mileage is accrued based on miles flown. Plus they match status easily.', 'There\'s no such thing as Delta ""transfer partners"".', 'I find that having status makes it worth it to focus on one airline. \n\nFirst, estimate your yearly spend on airfare and see whether it’s going to meet the qualifying dollars threshold at the gold level at least. For Delta, that’s $6k. Entry level elite status is not worth working toward. If you can hit the qualifying dollars mark easily (and keep in mind that taxes and fees don’t count toward the total) then if you fall short on the miles (50K for gold) you can take some cheap overseas vacations to earn more miles. \n\nFor me, the most reliably useful elite perk (I’m a United Platinum) is being able to switch to an earlier or later flight with no fee. And the nicest perk is to always get the extra legroom seats. You’ll want to examine the Delta and AA perks to see how likely you are to benefit. United, for you wouldn’t be an option since their hub is EWR.', 'The AA 321T (JFK-LAX & JFK-SFO) is excellent, even in economy. Other AA equipment I’d rank just below JetBlue for product quality. \n\n55K miles per year will just clear platinum status on AA (assuming $6k spend also).  You will rarely get upgrades on those routes at platinum status and if you do, you have to pay with 500 mile upgrades - so 5 of those each way out of pocket ($200 if not gained through flying). You will get MCE selection for free though, which is worth something. \n\nIf you fly odd hours/days or change planes, you may pick up an upgrade here or there and never, ever on a transcontinental red eye. \n\nSince it is close to the end of the year, fly as many of your top picks as you can and judge based on what is important to you. I did this when I started and ruled out United pretty quickly. \n\nIf you fly Premium Economy on AA metal, you will get 150% EQM credit. So a JFK-LHR RT will get you about 10k EQM. \n\nIf you choose AA, you can add the Citibank card that gets you into the admirals club and can get you another 10k EQM with $40k spend/year.  Not many other ways out there to pad EQMs unfortunately. \n\nAlso, there is the tried and true mileage run to bump your status.', ""Alaska has you covered. You'll easily earn status with the amount of flying you plan to do. Is it meaningful? On these routes, probably yes--Alaska has far fewer elites so you'll likely score the occasional upgrade.

167,Can I have Korean Air miles/Segments applied to my delta account instead of the Korean Air account?,0,axyxl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/axyxl9/can_i_have_korean_air_milessegments_applied_to_my/,2,1551908437.0,Work did something kind of weird with my travel next month. We book almost exclusively through Delta. I'm flying home airport in the US - ICN on Delta and then from ICN to  ITM on Korean Air. They are two completely separate bookings since the trip to Osaka was tacked on later and there are no Delta-run flights from ICN on the day we needed me to hop down. Return flights follow the same pattern in reverse. I was wondering if there's a way to link the Korean Air account to my Delta account so the miles count for that. I fly Delta a bunch but I have no idea when/if I'll fly Korean Air ever again. I think they are partners. ,"['Yes, just add your skymiles number to the KE booking.', ""Ok, Thanks!

168,San Juan trip in January,5,d7wijq,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/d7wijq/san_juan_trip_in_january/,8,1569215072.0,"My partner and I are going on a cruise in January that departs from San Juan on 1/4, returning 1/14.   We booked the cruise in cash via Costco Travel (very happy with the deal we got there), but we now need airfare and pre-cruise hotel.  I have some options but I'd love to know if there's something better.  I have \~100K each Chase UR points and AMEX points, and \~75K CapitalOne points.  Gold Status with United and Marriot, but not many points banked in either.

**Flights**

RT travel PHL -> SJU, 1/3/2020, returning 1/14/2020.  2 people, economy is fine.  

Outbound flights appear to be \~double the cost of return flights.

AA is hubbed in PHL and flies direct, \~$560 cash -> 76K Chase points via Chase travel.  I don't have enough AA points to book through them directly, and I don't know of any way to transfer in.

BA only offers reward flights for the return, non-direct (8h vs 3.5h) for 36K Avios total = \~25K MR points at current rates.  Then I could book the outbound leg via Chase points for \~48K, total price 73K.  That helps me use some MR points (which I've been having difficulty doing) but is a much crappier return flight.

I can't find any United Saver availability, and JetBlue and Delta would each take close to 100K points for the trip.  SW doesn't fly there on our dates.

Short answer, I think I need to book with Chase UR points.  I know the 1.5 cent value isn't the best I can get, but I don't think I can do any better on this trip.

&#x200B;

**Hotel**

Marriott has one Category 3 hotel in San Juan, a Courtyard, which is bookable for 17.5K points, or 14K Amex points with the current transfer bonus.  The hotel is currently booking for $250 per night, which seems par for other hotels in downtown San Juan.  This seems like a slam dunk - anybody see any downsides?","[""If you have any UR left, you could do Hyatt Place San Juan or just book in cash. Not sure of your dates but a random sampling looks like it is less expensive cash wise than Courtyard.\n\nIMO, Marriott's value lies in the 5th night free. I wouldn't transfer over MR to Marriott for a one night stay, especially when there are cheaper options."", 'You picked a hugely popular travel date, and the fare shows it.  When you have exact dates, use the portal.', 'That Courtyard is serviceable but I wouldn’t call it nice, and if you’re wanting to do anything in San Juan proper, it’s not really close to anything.  That being said, Uber is super cheap there.  Agree with the other comment to take a look at other options, though there might not be any ones that are more affordable.', 'Marriott has a promotion to buy points with a 30%discount at the moment. This could lower your hotel cost to $153.', 'The Sheraton is a Marriott property, we stayed there pre-cruise. Used my annual free credit card night so I’m not sure about pricing. It was nice, got upgraded to the Exec. Suite just by asking.', 'San Juan Marriott Stellaris is a mighty fine hotel.

Usually, the first couple weeks of December and January are the lease expensive cruise periods. \n\nI assume you\'ve looked at trying to book AA saaver space using BA Avios. That would my best suggestion. \n\nYou could do Spirit or frontier for less cash but no points options. Remember the bag fees will add with them though. \n\nMake sure to check to book 2 one-way tickets or awards for options. For example, you might find awards one-way but not the other or better pricing that way, etc. \n\nAlso, check Momondo and Skyscanner besides Google flights for cash options. Checking other nearby\'ish airports like NYC might be a thought as well. Good luck and enjoy your cruise. \n\nOh and remember that some of the cruise lines may use the Pan American Port East of downtown and not the main downtown traditional port. You likely know that or will find it on their website, etc. RC, NCL, Disney, and Celebrity do this at times. Just guessing on the dates it looks like you are on Celebrity Summit. I cruised this ship last October and it is very nice. We did dock at the Pan American port on that cruise.', 'Indeed.

I am just looking for Y seats and flexible with any kind of stopovers in between if not a direct. 

Please advise if i call BA and tell them that there are plenty of Qantas flights available with their award booking? do they honor it or should just transfer AVIOS to Qantas miles and book there directly?

Now, coming back to the next leg which is leaving from SYD to DPS then to MNL. Looking at the proximity of the award chard distance based..am i better off paying cash price or any other alternative to book the award space. 

Cash fare from SYD to DPS on Jan 1st is nothing less than $600 on cebu air on Y which is almost 8 hours flight. again.. from DPS to MNL around $400. I can see direct flight from SYD-MNL around $650 but i need to stay 3 night before heading to MNL.

Where should we focus our efforts over the next 6-8 months as we accumulate more miles/points?

My approach to all this is to focus on getting to Europe on the award and then tack on a separate award flight or LCC cash flight. Ideally, IST or ATH is the cheapest for LCC\'s. For awards, I\'ve had luck out of IST, AMM, CDG, and FRA but it varies. Google flights is a good resource to see if you can tack on a good connecting flight.

Before you begin, we recommend reading the following article: https://www.seat31b.com/2017/07/how-not-to-over-optimize-yourself-out-of-an-award/ - Remember, flexibility is key to a successful award trip.

- Origin and destination cities (are they flexible?)
- Number of Travelers (Your chances of success goes down as this number goes up)
- One way or round-trip
- Class of service desired
- Desired date(s) of travel (are they flexible? Hard dates == Less Chances for success)
- Your points balances: all airline, credit card and hotel points (If you are looking for J/K, think at least 6 digits)

TL;DR: CX has greater access to AY availability than even AY? \n\nI\'d like to think that I\'m more well-versed than the average enthusiast when it comes to the art of award travel, but I keep getting reminded that there is always something new to learn every day. Something pretty unexpected (at least, for me) happened while I was recently trying to book a USA->HEL award on AY: \n\nI was aiming to book two J seats on SEA-LAX-HEL-RVN, where SEA-LAX was obviously on AA metal and the rest on AY. There was plenty of space on SEA-LAX and HEl-RVN, so I wasn\'t worrying about that. The issue was getting two J for LAX-HEL, which was proving to be difficult to find. I first started using EF, BA and AA to search for availability, but every possible day seemed to show either 1 or 0 available. I really wanted this routing and started getting desperate, using KVS to search using JL and QF as well; I even created a Finnair Plus account to use AY\'s website to verify that what I saw on EF was correct. Still, nothing.\n\n...That is, until I finally started using CX to search (blame KVS for making CX the last OW option on their drop-down menu, lol). Suddenly, for every single flight that was showing just one seat available on EF/BA/AA/JL/QF/AY, I was seeing two on CX! My first reaction was that it had to be phantom space, since it didn\'t make sense to me that only CX would be able to book something that AY members can\'t even book for their own metal. And sure enough, after multiple phone calls to AA (both US reps and Australia/NZ/Fiji reps), none of them could see more than 1 seat. As a churner I\'d much rather use AA miles instead of CX miles, but at this point my itinerary wasn\'t going to work without LAX-HEL. \n\nSo I decided to finish booking one ticket for SEA-LAX-HEL-RVN via AA first, and see if the CX space persisted. Lo and behold, immediately after the ticket entered On Request status at AA, CX\'s inventory for that flight changed from CS2 to CS1. So then I braved CX\'s terrible hold times (~85 minutes this time) to try and book LAX-HEL-RVN via CX (it is not possible to book the whole SEA-RVN via CX, because that would trigger the multi-carrier chart, which does not allow one-ways). And the rep was able to pull it off without a hitch, to my surprise! I waited and waited to see if it would fall through, but nope, it came back as confirmed, ticket number issued and all, and I was able to select seats on both my AA ticket and my CX ticket. Of course I then had to book one SEA-LAX ticket separately via AA, but that\'s peanuts. Moral of the story: persistence sometimes pays off in unexpected ways...thank you, Asia Miles, for booking a Finnair award that even Finnair Plus could not. \n\nOn a related, but off-topic (since it\'s not exactly award travel), \'persistence\' note: \n\nI was trying to book a few nights in RVN around Christmas (I know I know, I was a bit late to the game). Most of the good value for money hotels had already sold out by now, so I was left with slim pickings. I was getting ready to bite the bullet and pony up some serious $$ for the higher-end hotels (e.g. Arctic Light), until I got an email from Club1Hotels about their 10% off eGC promotion that piqued my interest. Now normally I don\'t even bother checking Club1Hotels for pricing since their rates aren\'t usually low enough to convince me to switch from using discounted Hotels.com GC, but at this point I had nothing to lose. And to my surprise, one of the best-value hotels that showed as completely sold out on all the aggregators (TA, HC, Google, Agoda etc.), not to mention even the hotel\'s own website/reservations system, was still showing availability on Club1Hotels! It was super gimmicky trying to purchase their eGC and then actually use it on this reservation (eGC cannot be used on their website, so it required tons of emailing back and forth with ""screenshots""), but it worked out in the end. I confirmed directly with the hotel that my reservation was valid. \n\nCompared to my AY experience though, this wasn\'t really as surprising to me; I\'ve heard that hotels sell off portions of their inventory to wholesalers like Club1Hotels in advance, which at that point becomes the property of the wholesaler, and even the hotel operator would not have access to sell it. \n\nFinally: Choice Privileges\' May 13th complete block on most international redemptions (including all of Scandinavia) really threw a spanner into my hotel plans for Bergen and Oslo. That will go down as a dark day if the block turns out to be permanent.', ""Can we move the Airline Award Booking Basics thread to the sidebar?

This thread is renewed weekly and is intended for all discussions that do not warrant their own thread.

For AWARD BOOKING HELP please read the following information:

Volunteers may choose to help you plan and book your award trip. This is a free service we provide for the Reddit community, because we love you! <3

Before you begin, we recommend reading the following article: https://www.seat31b.com/2017/07/how-not-to-over-optimize-yourself-out-of-an-award/ - Remember, flexibility is key to a successful award trip.

- Origin and destination cities (are they flexible?)
- Number of Travelers (Your chances of success goes down as this number goes up)
- One way or round-trip
- Class of service desired
- Desired date(s) of travel (are they flexible? Hard dates == Less Chances for success)
- Your points balances: all airline, credit card and hotel points (If you are looking for J/K, think at least 6 digits)

It appears that my two best options are ANA first (F) class from LAX, SFO, or IAH (DFW is my home airport but I can relocate easily) or Delta One Suites (A350) from LAX.

Two questions:
1. Is it worth flying out of LAX or SFO (rather than IAH) in order to be able to fly into Haneda instead of Narita?
2. It appears that either redemption will cost me virtually the same number of Virgin Atlantic miles.  However, the ANA fuel surcharges are significantly higher.  Is ANA worth the additional several hundred dollars per person fuel surcharges?

""United changed their schedule and made the connection impossible!!!""

""United cancelled IAH-SYD for my date....."" etc. 

So you booked an award ticket in first class, and of course something goes wrong. What can you do? 

This is the guide to what you can do in this situation. Feel free to inform me if any part of the guide is wrong, and leave comments about your rebooking experiences.

====================================

The situations are mostly categorized as:

- Whether the ticket is sold by a US carrier (United, AA, Delta), or Asian carrier (ANA, EVA, etc); I never bought an award ticket through European carriers, so can't comment on that

- Whether the airline that sold you the ticket flies the route, eg. both ANA and United flies SFO-NRT

For simplicity, I would call the airline that sold you the ticket ""ticketing carrier"" TC, and the metal ""operating carrier"" OC

Basic knowledge:

Q: Flight cancelled! Who do I call?

A: TC. They sold you the ticket. OC will most likely not willing to modify the ticket, and can only takeover the ticket T-24h to departure.

==================================
Scenarios

a. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through US carriers

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

b. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through Asian carriers

- They will do the same and rebook you to your desired route on their own metal. This is true for the recent EVA strike.

c. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC flies the route

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

d. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC flies the route

- Varies.

- ANA: They WILL NOT open up their own space. Eg. SFO-TPE Eva air ticket through ANA. ANA can fly SFO-NRT-TPE, but THEY WILL NOT rebook you on their own metal. If no award ticket exists, they will CANCEL your ticket, and issue a refund. You can try to do a three way call (you, TC, OC), but most likely won't get you too far.

- Singapore airlines: They will rebook onto their own metal. 

- Need data points for other Asian carriers. 

e. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- You are probably out of luck. TC can't open up it's own space since they don't fly there, and they can't force OC to open up award space. You can try a three way call but you won't get too far. If TC flies to a nearby airport or award space exists for a nearby airport (eg. United flies to EWR, and original ticket was JFK), they should be willing to change your destination.

f. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- Worst case scenario. You can do a three way call, but most likely the ticket will just be cancelled. 


This is what I have experienced, and read stories on. Please feel free to correct me and share your experiences.

Lastly, when a ticket is cancelled, please be rational. If you book an intra-China ticket on Air China through United and the ticket is cancelled, don't expect United to force Air China to open a ticket; the ticket will most likely be cancelled.","["">d.

Since many have to decide between CX and JL for using AA and AS miles, I thought I'd list which one wins for me in a variety of areas:\n\n* Lounges:  CX, though the gap is tightening with recent news of CX food downgrades.\n* Transpacific F seats:  CX.  2 rows 3 across on CX.\n* Regional seats:  CX.  JL has pretty much all angle flat seats on regional flights.  CX has real lie flat seats in J, and an occasional F cabin.\n* Inflight Food:  JL a clear winner here, especially if you like Japanese food.\n* Champagne:  Push, maybe slight lean to JL.  JL had only one bottle of Salon, and CX still sometimes has Krug, but wouldn't count on it.\n* Service:  CX.  I find CX service much more warm, friendly and attentive.  JL is a little more cold, not quite as attentive or proactive, though still very professional.\n* Amenities:  CX wins for Pajamas, JL wins for other goodies.\n* Routing to SE Asia:  CX.  I much prefer a longer transpacific flight when the product is much better, and a shorter regional flight.\n* Routing for a stopover:  JL.  For me, Tokyo is a much better city to have a stopover in.\n* Short term Availability:  JL.  I don't plan a year ahead, so this is important to me.  Lately it seems that availability on CX is much tighter in F/J, likely due to the mistake fares a couple months ago.  Also, when they do open it up, it's usually only 7-10 days out.  JL can open up space 2-3 weeks out.\n* Value:  Push with AA miles, CX with AS miles.  F prices a little higher on JL with AS miles.  It will cost 110k AA miles to SE Asia in F transpacific/J regional whether or not you do a stopover, so if flying on JL then might as well do a stopover in Tokyo.\n\nFor me, it comes down to if I am going to SE Asia without any stopover then I choose CX hands down.

This is a [blog post from a few years ago from Lucky](https://onemileatatime.com/much-award-tickets-cost-airlines/) that shares some data points of what internal billing is like between airlines for award seats. Also I have a funny feeling that the ticketing airline keeps the YQ and other non-government fees, so looking at that RTW that was just posted, they paid ANA $2200 cash plus whatever ANA got from amex for the 250k MR. Lets assume Amex pays ANA 0.8 cpp. I don\'t know what it is, maybe it\'s .9 or 1. Think ANA is going to be paying their partners $4500 for based off those reimbursement rates, even if they have gone up since that blog post was published?\n\nAlso remember, the only true cost to an airline on their own metal (ignoring the relatively small variable cost of having somebody in a seat vs flying it empty) is the cost of having the ability to sell a ticket in that cabin on that flight to somebody else, and not being able to because it\'s taken up by an award ticket. Frankly if airline revenue management is doing its job well, that shouldn\'t be happening anyway. Also many non-US airlines are simply willing to let premium cabins fly with empty seats. I flew Asiana, ANA, and EVA J. On the long haul J flights, there were a couple empty seats on EVA and at least a half dozen on Asiana that I stopped counting. So what was really the cost to them? A couple meals and a bottle of serviceable bubbles and a bit more fuel to fly my 5\'8\'\' frame from ICN-LAX. \n\nThat\'s what makes this an interesting industry.

218,Florida Keys Vacation,20,cjcsa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cjcsa6/florida_keys_vacation/,43,1564443027.0,"Hi all,

I'm trying to put together a somewhat economical trip for my family of 4 to go down to Key West for 5 nights somewhere around the dates of Mar 13-18 (with some flexibility), flying from Asheville, NC.  Here are the points that I am working with:

Delta: 77k (Currently Silver)

Hilton: 240k (Currently Gold)

Hyatt: 50k (Currently Discoverist)

Barclays CC Points: 85k (Worth $850 in travel credits)

So far, I have found flights from AVL to EYW for $388 each, or 34k points each +$11.  My thought is to get 2 tickets with Delta points, and then cover the remaining $776 with my Barclays points.

For hotels, I'm seeing a number of options:

Hyatt Centric Key West: 25k Hyatt Points per Night

Hilton Garden Inn Key West: 60k Hilton Points per Night

Casa Marina Key West: 90k Hilton Points per Night

Baker's Cay Resort: 80k Hilton Points per Night

The Reach Waldorf Astoria: 80k Points per Night

My initial thought is to do a stay at the 60k Hilton Garden Inn for the first night, and then finish out the remaining 4 nights at one or two of the fancier resorts.  Maybe 2 nights at the Hyatt Centric, and 2 nights at The Reach Waldorf Astoria?

Quick questions:

* I was trying to find a good way to swing the 5th night free with Hilton, but other than the Garden Inn I wouldn't have enough points to make that happen.  Anything I am missing here?
* Many of these resorts have $50-ish per night resort fees.  Any idea if those are still charged with points redemptions?
* Is it wise to book this far ahead in advance?  Any idea what the sweetspot would be for booking a March trip?
* Does anyone have experience with any of these hotels, or which would be the best bang for the buck?
*  This would be my first trip to the Keys, so any suggestions/recommendations would be helpful!

Thanks in advance.","['You may want to consider flying into Miami, renting a car and driving down to Key West. Drive is over three hours but it is a beautiful and pleasant experience.

Hilton Garden Inn is in new town and not walkable to downtown if that matters.\n\nFwiw that’s the most expensive and busiest time of year', 'I would recommend not staying at the Casa Marina Waldorf Astoria in Key West. We stayed one night and checked out early. After staying at the Roosevelt in New Orleans and seeing the Waldorf in NYC it was hard to imagine it being called a Waldorf property. The common areas were ok, but the rooms left a lot to be desired. Save your Hilton points for other places.\n\nedit: clarified that i was talking about Casa Marina.', ""As a resident of /r/KeyWest and /r/floridakeys and frequent poster, I'd be glad to point you in the right direction as far as activities to do. How many are you, what do you like to do, etc?

The Garden Inn is about as far away as you can be with limited walking access to restaurants and attractions but they do have a  shuttle.  If I was coming here with kids, I would choose the Casa.  As far as things to do, there is another beach with an entry fee, Ft Zachary Taylor State park which is about as nice as a beach gets on Key West.  There is also a city park nearby with playground and a waterpark thing which is nice.  Also the FL Keys Eco Center which is interesting.   The best thing to do, albeit, expensive is a day trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park.  I've been dozens times and enjoy it still.   There's a nice catamaran, Argo Navis, that does a trip to Woman's Key which is pretty special.   The graveyard is pretty interesting to bike through, as is all of Old Town.  Key West is a fun town with good restaurants and bars but getting out on the water is really where it's at, especially the backcountry.  I've lived here going on 30 years if you have any questions."", 'Can only speak on behalf of the Hyatt Centric, but it is my go-to hotel in Key West due to its location and ability to walk everywhere. The Hilton Garden Inn is a few miles away from where all of the action is and not really walkable, but you would be able to get your 5th night free. I guess it comes down to how important location is to you', ""I have been to Casa Marina several times - it's probably over-categorized as a Waldorf-Astoria but it's a nice area of KW to stay since it gives you larger beach access (unlike the Centric which has a small private beach tucked into the complex) but still walking distance to Duval Street (unlike the Hilton Garden Inn, or any other resort on the east side of KW). Rooms are big and generally updated but it's definitely got more of a beach resort feel than a luxury feel. I don't have kids but it always seems to have a lot of families staying there; lots of activities available.\n\nDon't rush to book it, it is big and rarely full. The standard cost for that time of year is ~$500 per night so a 90k per night redemption is just a bit over 0.5cpp, which is average for Hilton. They also run a fourth-day-free deal constantly which doesn't apply to point redemptions. Gold status will not help you avoid the resort fee."", ""As far as recommendations, do the trolley tour.

How old are your kids?"", ""At 60k/ night at the Hilton you have just enough to cover the whole thing. Remember that in award stays, the fifth night is free at Hilton.\n\nHilton points are about as valuable as pesos, and they only seem to get worse tbh. I wouldn't hesitate to use them.  Key west isn't too big anyway that you can't get around the whole island in a day"", 'I just booked Bakers Cay.  It just opened back up in January from a refresh.  Should be a good choice.', 'Not sure about other brands but with Hilton, resort fee is waived if you pay with points. \n\nAt least it was last time I redeemed at a location with a resort fee. \n\nOtherwise you’ve covered all the usual bases that I can see.', ""I got married at the Centric, it's nice, the beach is small/non-existent but it's right in the center of action for Key West.  IIRC we were also looking at getting married at The Reach (it may have been called something different).  It was nice too, larger beach, but further away from all of the Key West offerings.  It depends on what is more important to you.\n\nSome higher status points stays get you out of paying resort fees, but on points with lower/no status you'll be paying them.  I hate to say it, but it is what it is now."", 'May also want to look at cruises. They are severely discounted right now because the Cuba embargo made a lot of cruises change itinerary’s and thus people canceled there cruises. Most are for trips departing soon but some good really good deals still exist for 2020. Like around $40-50 per person per day.', ""I second this, if nothing, but for the drive alone.  I honestly remember the drive better than my actual time spent on Key West itself. Granted I was like 11 at the time and not exactly old enough to enjoy (or understand) the fun parts of Key West. Especially if this is going to be a family vacation (from what I remember a lot of Key West was guitars and tiki bars... fun but not particularly memorable for a 11yr old). \n\nDefinitely do the drive down, you won't regret it.

On Duval but a few blocks from where things start getting crazy they have they’re own pool and small beach they take care of with a bar/restaurant, not many beach areas on the island so loved that. Also check an event calendar before you set dates they have some weird festivals and parades you may want to steer clear of.', 'Another vote for the Hyatt Centric. They don\'t charge Resort fees on Redemption nights, but they do charge for parking. Although, there is no need for a car in Key West. The Reach and Casa Marina are far from anything and that would include a lot of walking to get anywhere. The Hyatt Centric is so close to so many things but I especially recommend ""The Bight"". It\'s long boardwalk along a Marina and it\'s a wonderful place to walk with kids - you can feed the fish in the water see Pelicans, lots of restaurants, etc...all at a nice, leisurely pace. I basically spend all of my time there when I\'m in Key West.\nYou know... You have enough time for you and P2 to get two Hyatt credit cards, at 50k points a pop that\'s four more nights that would give you six nights total.\n\nEdit: I should say there\'s no need for a car when staying in Old Town.

Have already booked my flights there on some business ""saver"" (lol) Skymiles awards, but am struggling to find an efficient way back. Look to fly business on the way back as well. I have looked at some of the following options:

Air France/KLM to JFK: 80k per ticket + 300 fuel charges

United to Newark: No saver so 140k per ticket + 90 fuel charges

Aeroplan: 2 stops, 115k miles each plus fuel charges

&#x200B;

Miles are UR 180k, MR 150k, used up my Skymiles for the way there. Right now Air France is the best option, but trying to avoid $600 in fees if possible. Ideally Delta would open up some low lever awards so that I could book through Virgin, but not sure if that will ever happen at all. Wanted to know if anyone had any other advice or if I should just eat the $600? Thanks!

&#x200B;

Update\*\*: Ended up finding Delta space from Amsterdam to our home airport with one stop in the US at saver level on the 8th, so we decided to extend the trip and check out the city. Thanks for the help everyone, lot of good suggestions, but the reward space from FB closed on me outside of 6am flights(not happening on my honeymoon lol).

224,Should I get Platinum Delta SkyMiles to get 10K MQM in order to get to Gold Medallion?,4,9ndsws,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9ndsws/should_i_get_platinum_delta_skymiles_to_get_10k/,11,1539319814.0,"Hello fellow travelers.

&#x200B;

This is my second year as a Silver Medallion and I'd say I've been very happy with it. My wife and I got ""upgraded"" to Comfort+ in about 95% of our flights (we live in Boston, MA) and it's awesome being able to pick the best seats available during purchase. We also got an upgrade to Business with Aeromexico after telling them I was a Skyteam Elite during check-in. 

&#x200B;

My wife and I will fly to India (New Delhi) in December (26th) and come back in January. This is our itinerary: PHX-DTW-AMS-DEL. I'm super excited to fly DTW-AMS on Delta's new A350. According to some un-official MQM calculator ([https://cwsi.net/calc/dl/](https://cwsi.net/calc/dl/)), I will make about 9450 MQM on my way to India (and about the same coming back but the return is in Jan 2019). Even after getting those MQMs, I will still be 9K MQM away from getting to Gold (because of the December 31st deadline). 

&#x200B;

I just received an offer from Delta for the Platinum Delta SkyMiles: 50.000 bonus miles (I know the 70K offer expired last month.. oh well..) + 10K MQM after spending $1000. Annual fee is $195 but I get a $100 statement credit after making a Delta purchase within the first 3 months. So I consider the annual fee as only $95 for the first year. 

&#x200B;

Those 10K MQM will be enough for me to get to Gold Medallion before the end of the year.

&#x200B;

My three questions:

1. Will the MQMs from the flight to India on December 26th clear before before December 31st? 
2. If I apply now, receive the card in a few days and put a $1000 in order to get the bonus + MQM, how long will it take for me to see the 10K MQM in my account?
3. Is this a good plan??

Our trip is in April of next year, and we're going to Qatar, Jordan, and Israel over 12 days.  Thank you again to you folks here at /r/awardtravel for the great ideas and inspiration.  This is the first award trip I've been able to put together where we actually depart and return to the same airport.  Wonderfully, it's also our home airport: JFK.

**\*\*Points Used:\*\***

* 175,000 AA
* 150,000 IHG
* 170,000 Delta

**\*\*Flights\*\***

Compared to some of my other award booking experiences in the past (Japan, South-East Asia, India, France) booking these flights was a complete breeze.  Getting what I really wanted, however, was a different story.  I had loads of AA miles, and searching for space was simple on their website.  I found two seats on Qatar airways in Qsuites J on their new A350-1000 for 70k miles and minor taxes per person.  Flights leave from JFK and arrive to Doha the next morning.

Here's where I don't get my way.  The wife and I wanted to see Qatar, but didn't want to spend a lot of time there, so I endeavored to find a flight going from Doha to Amman, Jordan that left within 24 hours of our arrival.  American routing rules only allow for a 24-hour stopover on the same award ticket.   There are multiple oneworld carriers leaving from Doha to Amman every morning, but the timing was 26 or 27 hours after we landed, so they wouldn't be allowed by AA.  I did find one flight that left 24 hours and 20 minutes after we landed, and tried tried tried tried to get AA to allow it, but they wouldn't budge.  24 hours is 24 hours.   I ended up spending 17.5k points pp to book us on one of the next morning flights in Y for the 2.5 hour flight.  I considered cash rates, but they were VERY high - \~$900 for just the one-way for two people.  Points made more sense.

For our flights home, we were leaving from Israel - I easily found space on Virgin Atlantic from Tel Aviv to London to JFK in Upper Class for 85,000 miles and $70 per person.  The flight from London to JFK is slotted to be on their new A350-1000 as well, so I'm excited to try that!  I looked into finding non-stops, but there appeared to be only three carriers doing it: United (which I didn't want to spend my UR on this), Delta (which cost 350k points per person), and El Al (which only transfers with MR for the horrible rate of 20:1000).

**\*\*Hotels\*\***

My wife and I ended up booking most of our hotels with cash, as the rates this early before the trip were very reasonable.   Most nice hotels in the three countries we're going to didn't end up being more than $200 a night, the two exceptions being the Four Seasons Doha and Amman.

The points exception, however, was the Intercontinental David Tel Aviv - I actually got these points by cancelling an Intercontinental stay in Osaka that I had booked in a previous post, and had a few work stays in Kimptons and Indigos between then and now.  The award rate was 50k points per night, and cash rates were over $400, so it felt like a great deal!  The total cost was 200k, but IHG has the ""4th night free"" promotion on reward bookings, so it was only 150k points out of pocket.

We're looking forward to trying falconry in Qatar, camping in the desert in Wadi Rum, seeing Jerusalem, swimming in the Dead Sea, walking around Petra, and exploring all the amazing food!  Can't wait to come back with a trip report.

Some of the dates, I have verified. Others I have not and I know some are wrong. I live 16-19 time zones away from most of you, so many dates are +- a day. Due to my time zone “issues,” my strategy is to look a week or two before I think my days are bookable and use that to calibrate the exact day I can book.

Sometimes time zones make a difference if you want to snag an award that is released on a schedule. As a general rule, if the booking airline is the limiting one, it will be released according to their time zone. If the operating carrier is the limiting one, there is a higher chance it will be released based off of the operating carriers time zone.  As a general rule, an airline cannot book partner award space before they open up bookings for their own space.  Qantas is one exception to this rule.

Please help complete this list. It is old and out of date. Feel free to correct dates, add airlines, or add dates.

**Edit: How to use this list.** If you are booking a partner award look at the line for the airline you are looking to fly **and** the airline that operates the mileage program you are booking through. The lower of the two numbers is when you can book the seat. Example: Booking JAL via AA. JAL seats become available at 360 days and AA allows booking 331 days out.  You can book these seat 331 days out. Remember that the time zone of the more restricted airline/program is what matters.

If you are trying to book a seat with a program that does not allow you to book at schedule opening, like the JAL example.  You can check JAL's website at 331+ to get an idea of what seats will be available when AA gets access to JAL's space.

The exact time of day does matter for some bookings.  Please leave any time DP you have in the comments.

However, I have never really used miles/points to book this big of a trip so I am looking for tips as to how to get the best deal for them. We are flexible as to where we go, maybe not London and Dublin though (been to those). Here is our current breakdown of points (keeping in mind, I will be able to get a lot more points here in the next couple months, via MS if I have to, to make this trip possible. Looking now at just creating a rough game plan for where to go and what my focus should be via points. We are out of RDU (as per the title).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1) 100k Delta Miles (Delta Biz, Gold)

2) 150k Hilton Points (Biz, Ascend, will have the free night this year and then once again in 2019)

3) Roughly should have 350k UR points in the coming couple months 

4) Companion Pass does nothing, but I do have it 

5) 100k MR (not looking to use them, long term plan is to cash them out via CS Plat, in a year or two)

6) Willing to get more cards, if needed... of course. 

EDIT: as per the first comment, if we had a choice right now we would go to Italy or Germany and potentially hop around within those countries. ","[""i'm planning a trip to Italy too, but not until October-ish! "", 'That time of the year may still be relatively cold in Germany. It might even be chilly in Italy. \n\nGiven that, I would definitely think about Portugal, southern Spain, southern Italy, maybe Sardinia or Greece. \n\nRDU is a Delta hub and your dates are inflexible.  Type those dates in to the Delta website and see what you can find. Try major airports like MAD, BCN, FCO, MXP, ATH. Also try some smaller cities. \n\nDelta has nice coverage to those airports. Relatively poor coverage to Germany because Lufthansa is Star Alliance. \n\nIf you want to spend a few days in a capital city, this is a good way to do it. If you go to Rome, the trains are nice and cheap and will take you many places. Renting a car can be a harrowing experience especially in southern Italy and Greece. \n\nOnce you find some specific plans that seem doable, look at booking an “open jaw” with delta and built your itinerary around that. Maybe fly into northern Italy (Milan MXP or Venice VCE) and take the train down over a week or two towards southern Italy, before cutting back north and flying out of Rome (FCO). \n\nDon’t be afraid of crazy itineraries if you’re spending a couple weeks. The low cost carrier flights can be *super* cheap if you book in advance (avoid Ryan Air, most others are ok-ish but make sure you understand baggage rules). \n\nIf you were going a month later I’d suggest the Croatian coast, but May is too cool and variable to say for sure. Don’t plan a beach trip abroad if you know there’s a significant chance the weather may suck. \n\nNote as well. I’d bet money you will see round trip flights on sale (<$500 round trip each, 33,333 UR with CSR) before March for your dates out of RDU if you watch something like Scott’s Cheap Flights. \n\nI think for coach flights to Europe, the cash fares are so often on sale that it doesn’t make sense to blow miles on flying to major cities. If you’re taking a miles flight, at least go somewhere beautiful and a bit remote. \n\nWhat do you and your wife like to do on vacation? ', ""People shouldn't be deciding where you go for vacation. It's your life, where do you want to go visit? Are you just trying to get on a plane because you can at a discounted price? It'll be easier for us to help you find routes if you have a loose game plan. "", 'Well we are flexible. It’s super expensive to get there. Even with points. ', 'That is really really smart. Thanks for the feedback on this post. I am hoping that we will be able to switch are dates around and go a different time because right now the flights are $1300+, and $500 a lot more manageable, even with the points.   \n\n\nIn terms of what we would do there, I think we enjoy trips where this is a lot of walking around and seeing new things. We are not the people that really enjoy going one place and sitting still the whole time (I am thinking like an all inclusive place)', 'Valid point. Preference is Italy or Germany. ', 'These routes regularly go on sale for <$500 each round trip. \n\nRDU to Milan was on sale Oct 20 for $490 ea for instance. Other recent similar sales for RDU to Rome or Milan were Oct 12, Oct 4, and Sept 18. \n\nYou are more likely to see late May early June on sale than late June through late August, which is high season. \n\nShoulder seasons (late spring and early fall) can be good times to travel. Smaller crowds, cheaper hotels and flights, but you do risk worse weather. ', ""I just checked prices. 100k Delta miles isn't enough for two round trips to Europe. At most you can get two one-ways. Make sure to book that from the US to Europe--the fees are very low ($6) and the miles are decent (37k ea). The other way, the fees are around $225 with the same cost in miles. Round trip fees will be around $70 though, but you don't have the needed 145k miles to book two round trips.\n\n On United, the return flights are a bit better and you can transfer your UR over. I see prices around 30k miles and $70 in fees for one way leaving Europe.\n\nOf course, this is why I said planning around a sale is smartest--it's silly to spend 74k Delta miles, $12 in fees plus 60k United miles (via UR), plus $140 in fees for a total cost of 134k miles and $146 when you can buy those same flights for $500-600 each.\n\nI'd seriously consider using the Companion pass to book a positioning flight with Southwest into whatever New York / Boston / Philly airport works for a cheap flight to/from Italy. I'm seeing plenty of NYC and Boston flights on TAP Air Portugal for around $500 round trip. Again, I bet these will go lower.

I can chose my outbound flight fine but almost all the inbound flights - all of which are nearly completely unsold - are listed as ""sold out"" when using the companion fare.

If I went again I’d probably want to stay in Lahaina since there’s a good amount of non-hotel activities and we don’t really like to be hotel bound, plus I think you basically have to pick to stay on the east or west side of the entire island so you can’t use the middle as a base. \n\nIf you’re a Costco member check their packages since for us it was cheaper than booking direct and they threw in the rental car.

Plenty of nice places to stay as well.  Check the Wailea and Kaanapali areas."", ""Took my first trip to Hawaii this september, stayed 7 days in maui.

Can't recommend that place enough super close to the beach where you can rent some snorkel gear from the hotel go out 50 ft in the water and start seeing all sorts of fish and turtles. I couldn't believe more people weren't snorkeling right there off the beach or if they were aware of all the fish around the coral just nearby. So we did snorkeling every day there which was cheap(just wear a sunshirt and sunscreen!) then did a planned snorkeling trip to Molokini booked through marriott moments. Im a marriott guy for work so that drove a lot of my deicisions obviously. One thing you should know is rent a car, specifically a jeep if possible so you can do the road to Hana more easily. That is a great cheap way to spend your time in Maui if you like hiking and nature sightseeing. Just google road to Hana.

One thing is that this is only a few hundred dollars cheap for the two of us than simply buying the tickets we want (award tickets are very expensive and there are close-in fees so doesn't seem worth it). But my question is, after buying the companion itinerary, is there any way to THEN possibly change the flight going NYC-PHX?

My summary of key things to do in advance and during bad weather/irregular operations:\n\n1.  Book with a credit card offering good trip delay coverage.  This means you can immediately grab a hotel, Uber there, grab food, without worrying about the cost.  Just save receipts and get a printed ""military excuse"" from the airline to prove the delay.   Also try not to check bags if you can avoid it- makes life a million times easier to just get out of the airport ASAP after a cancellation.\n\n     https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/6w1bwb/where_to_get_flight_delaycancellation_statement/\n\n2.  When things get bad (long delays, cancellations), immediately start looking up available options.  Just go to the airline website and start looking for cash one-way tickets, so you can see all flights that have available seats.  Stuff can change minute-to-minute as agents are rebooking people.  Also hopefully you didn\'t check a bag (see above), so you can just hop on a flight even if it leaves in 20 minutes.\n\n3.  DO NOT wait in the customer service line.  Waste of time as everything available will be gone by the time you get to the front.  Call the international phone numbers for the airline as they will have a much shorter wait time.  I now keep $10 on my Google Voice account as a cushion, but of course you can add to it within a minute.  Look up the UK/Australia/New Zealand reservations number for the airline so you can guarantee someone who is English speaking.  Any agent anywhere in the world can change your ticket.  Tell them what flights you want and lock it in ASAP.  If you need to, do this from the hotel room you booked that will be covered with your credit card!\n\nEDIT: Forgot that if you have access to the airline lounge/club (not a Priority Pass or Amex one), go there immediately and work with the agents there to rebook.  Likely will be a pretty short line if at all, and the agents in the lounges are normally really really good at rebooking, finding options, etc.', ""Well, it was both of our first J experiences, so we really enjoyed ourselves.

I have been prototyping possible flights starting now to get a sense of actual cost, availability etc, since we're approaching the magical 330 or 331 day mark for these airlines. Here are some things I have found, and I have some questions about the process...

\*Virgin Airlines - 50k BOS->CDG ""upper class"", one way, serviced by Delta DL404 (we would pick up a regional or other flight from there to crete, I would think) on a single day (June 6th), otherwise a few other days at 72.5k

\*Air France - 53k BOS->ATH ""Business"" AF321+AF1832, a few different days

1. Have read three or four blog posts re: booking virgin, and I'm still confused on how to figure out if a flight is available for a business/""upper class"" award booking via Virgin on a partner. In the example above, I cross referenced the June 6th BOS->CDG business award seat on expertflyer on delta, and I \*think\* it corresponds to a Z class fare -- but there is only ever 1 Z class fare seat it seems. How do I figure out if there are other fare classes I could book business/first class on virgin with delta carrier? Or is the virgin website essentially accurate?
2. Ie., to ask a similar question, what exactly should I be searching for on Delta and other Virgin partners to find a Virgin business class award? Another example, Delta offers a BOS->JFK->ATH that Virgin does not show exists, how can I tell if Virgin has a business award seat on such a flight (if I were to call Virgin directly to book). 
3. Many sources say you might have to book these within ""minutes"" of seats being released. For Virgin, it's supposed to be 331 days, but what *minute* will seats become available? Is it 331 days from departure time? What about for air france?

Many thanks :)","['I planned this trip about 18 months ago. We never took it because life happened (job loss, surprise newborn baby), but the short answer here is that you probably DO have enough miles to make the trip and to do so in business one way.\n\nYour best option, given your impressive stack of United miles, is probably going to be combining those with your even more impressive stack of UR to get the job done. There IS a seasonal nonstop flight from Newark to Athens on United; if I were you I’d focus my efforts on that flight. It avoids a connection in Western Europe, meaning you can get a full night of sleep in your lie-flat seat. Your other real option with the stack of miles you have is probably Lufthansa connecting in Germany, but you’ll be tired all day.\n\nFWIW, there were three other nonstops from the US to Athens when I looked: Emirates from EWR, AA from PHL, and DL from JFK... but you definitely do not have enough miles to make those happen. You have found the last one on Virgin, but I wouldn’t waste time on it because you’re trying to redeem for premium seats on Delta which is really hard for DELTA flyers, much less through other programs.\n\nI would focus on getting a lie-flat bed on the eastbound leg because that is when you need to sleep. Coming home you can probably use your Delta miles and/or just pay cash.\n\nHotels, of course, are a separate issue. They are pricey and you should have a plan for them.', ""Awesome, thank you!

But now those four upgrades only go half as far. You have to use two upgrades per person per way for guaranteed business class. Since I’m a teacher I can only take vacation when school is out, which is peak travel times and unlikely to snag a business upgrade via upgrade list.

I’m really disappointed in this. I looked forward to this perk every year. My partner travels 50-70% of the time and this was a nice way to make up for it. I’m also a terrible traveler, and can’t sleep on planes so flying horizontal is important for long flights. (We flew Premium Select from ATL to Seoul and I was miserable) Any suggestions on how to get our one business class trip each year? (We are not based in the USA so I’m not sure if credit card options would work)","[""> You have to use two upgrades per person per way for guaranteed business class.\n\nWhat? No you don't. Don't waitlist/upgrade for PS, and only for J."", ""You posted this same thing a few months ago. Everyone told you then, you don't need 2 certs per person. But you do if you want to waitlist for PS and D1 at the same time.  \n  \nThe certs are not guaranteed to clear, there has to be space for you. Sounds like there wasn't space. Next time, call before you book, and see if there is availability for you to upgrade via a GUC instantly so you don't have to waitlist.  \n  \nOr just book with miles, your partner travels a lot apparently. He/she must have plenty of skymines to burn, so just use them for J flights. That's what I do.
