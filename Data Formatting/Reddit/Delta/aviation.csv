People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the 172. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Mundane, maybe. Even boring at times. But there was one day in our Cessna experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be some of the slowest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when my CFI and I were flying a training flight. We needed 40 hours in the plane to complete my training and attain PPL status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the 40 hour mark. We had made the turn back towards our home airport in a radius of a mile or two and the plane was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the left seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because I would soon be flying as a true pilot, but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Bumbling across the mountains 3,500 feet below us, I could only see the about 8 miles across the ground. I was, finally, after many humbling months of training and study, ahead of the plane. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for my CFI in the right seat. There he was, with nothing to do except watch me and monitor two different radios. This wasn\'t really good practice for him at all. He\'d been doing it for years. It had been difficult for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my this part of my flying career, I could handle it on my own. But it was part of the division of duties on this flight and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. My CFI was so good at many things, but he couldn\'t match my expertise at sounding awkward on the radios, a skill that had been roughly sharpened with years of listening to LiveATC.com where the slightest radio miscue was a daily occurrence. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what my CFI had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Denver Center, not far below us, controlling daily traffic in our sector. While they had us on their scope (for a good while, I might add), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to ascend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone SR-71 pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied:""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country\'s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn\'t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\nJust moments after the SR-71\'s inquiry, an F-18 piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" Boy, I thought, the F-18 really must think he is dazzling his SR-71 brethren. Then out of the blue, a Twin Beech pilot out of an airport outside of Denver came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Twin Beech driver because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Beechcraft 173-Delta-Charlie ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I\'m thinking to myself, hey, that Beech probably has a ground speed indicator in that multi-thousand-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol\' Delta-Charlie here is making sure that every military jock from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He\'s the slowest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new bug-smasher. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""173-Delta-Charlie, Center, we have you at 90 knots on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that my CFI was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere minutes we\'ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Beechcraft must die, and die now. I thought about all of my training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, half a mile above Colorado, there was a pilot screaming inside his head. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the right seat. That was the very moment that I knew my CFI and I had become a lifelong friends. Very professionally, and with no emotion, my CFI spoke: ""Denver Center, Cessna 56-November-Sierra, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Cessna 56-November-Sierra, I show you at 76 knots, across the ground.""\n\nI think it was the six knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that my CFI and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most CFI-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we\'re showing closer to 72 on the money.""\n\nFor a moment my CFI was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when Denver came back with, ""Roger that November-Sierra, your E6B is probably more accurate than our state-of-the-art radar. You boys have a good one.""\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable stroll across the west, the Navy had been owned, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Slow, and more importantly, my CFI and I had crossed the threshold of being BFFs. A fine day\'s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to our home\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/8n0j55/aspen_20_to_la_center_requesting_speedcheck/dzso8kf/', '[deleted]', 'How?', 'I’m not seeing the conflict.

52,Q: Why was the engine not fully shutt-down on the Delta flight in July which suffered an engine failure?,0,cixuvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/cixuvb/q_why_was_the_engine_not_fully_shuttdown_on_the/,12,1564359907.0,"I've watched the video of the Delta engine failure earlier this month and since the centre spinner was detached I could clearly see that the engine was still burning fuel. Judging by the speed of rotation I would guess the engine was windmilling rather than under power.

My question is - why was the engine not fully shut down once it failed?","[""It is shut down. And no you cannot see the flames from the combustion chamber. Between what you can see, which if the fan has gone is the the front stage of the low stage compressors, of which there are 6 stages, then 7 high pressure,  before you would be able to see the combustion chamber. You can see in [this video](https://youtu.be/nqx0ykoGo9c) of a model JT8D how far back the chambers are.\n\nWhat you can see in the clip is red hot metal from all the broken parts of the engine.  The glowing looks like the centre hub has lost the bearing so its heated up by the huge amount of friction. The flashing bits round the outside are bits being hit between the still spinning compressor and the engine lining, think like a grinding wheel fires sparks of hot metal as it abrades it's the same process."", 'I believe the engine was shut down. When I saw the original post, someone asked that question and I believe I read a comment that said it was shut down and that it was the wind moving through. I could be completely wrong yet I believe I read that somewhere.', 'It was fully shut down, it was windmilling. Unless there was physically debris that stopped the fans from spinning, they are gonna keep spinning. There is no way to stop the fan from windmilling.', ""It's not possible to tell the state of the engine by looking through the fan. I'm not sure why the inside of the shaft is glowing however that's not fuel being burned since the fuel isn't combusted until farther aft in the engine. That's definitely some sort of friction heat. I'm sure there was a master warning in the cockpit after a sensor went off and the pilots performed whatever emergency procedure to either rectify the warning or shut down and secure the engine."", 'There\'s no ""brake"" on a turbine engine - what you\'re seeing is windmilling caused by the air. If that were not allowed to occur - if the engine were braked to stop the fan blade from spinning - you\'d just have a ton more drag on that side, which could lead to control problems at lower speeds (such as on landing). Not safe. That\'s why engines are allowed to windmill when shut down.\n\nProps can be stopped because they can be feathered into the wind. Turbines are just big bricks hanging off the airplane if they\'re completely stopped.', 'The video that was taken by one of the passengers clearly shows flames in the combustion chamber. As it is not clear how soon after the failure the video was taken, the engine may well have not been completely shut down at the point the video was taken.', 'Nah, you just gotta feather the turbines.', ""As far as I know it was shutdown. And you simply can't see flames in combustion chamber, that's just impossible."", ""No.... that's just not how it works..."", 'Yeah I’m definitely not 100% confident in my answer therefor I could be completely talking out of my ass!! 😂', 'Seriously underrated comment', 'Lol']"

Killing the C-series, or Boeing losing out on a contract it might have gotten sometime in the future, the end result is the same. No one is losing or gaining more than they ever do. "", ""The person above you just said the exact opposite, at this point I don't know who to believe.\n\n>From what I've heard from AS management in SEA is that they are on lease and once the term ends they're replacing them with 737s. "", ""That's cool. I like the airbus in their colors. "", 'Bombardier successfully proved their case in court, so they indeed won. It just sucks that the ""exact"" specifications of their desired aircraft are like 20 inches off of Boeing\'s smallest plane. It\'s been a long time since I\'ve ran the numbers, but last time I checked the Boeing MAX jets had a much better fuel economy per passenger.\n\nThe real point is that Boeing can sell to US airlines at a loss, this is not a violation of anti-dumping rules. The US taxpayers subsidize that loss so that (in theory) Boeing, the US funded aircraft manufacturer, will be the strong and profitable.\n\nAnti-dumping agreements were put in place to protect local interests from foreign government subsidized unfair competition, such as selling a 100million jet to a foreign country for 20million and foreign subsidies.', ""they (AS management) might be saying that off the record or trying to will it into happening. there are issues with the airbus metal (no AVIs, for instance) and AS has a strong connection to Boeing as they're both in SEA, but there has been no official communication from AS that they are actively looking to phase out the Airbuses. It would not surprise me if they really want to, though.""]"

I think it still holds the absolute speed record for a single-engined aircraft. More fun stuff from AirVectors:\n\nThe F-106s primarily operated in the defense of the North American continent, flying from the continental US, Alaska, Canada, and Iceland, but were deployed temporarily on occasions to Germany and South Korea. They were not deployed to Southeast Asia, and Darts rarely flew in anything but standard ADC colors -- overall light gray with black nose, though squadron colors on the tailfin tended towards the flashy. Some very gaudy ""red white & blue"" paint schemes were sported by a few F-106s in 1976 in honor of the US bicentennial.\n\nUpgrades were performed on a regular basis. Early upgrades were generally to fix aircraft teething problems, leading to additions such as a clear-view canopy; an airfield arresting hook; improved variable engine inlet ramps; retractable IRST unit; linear ""tape""-style dashboard indicators that were easier to read than the original dial indicators; radar warning receiver; and improved solid-state electronics.\n\nFrom 1967, F-106As were fitted with the General Electric M61A Vulcan 20-millimeter six-barreled Gatling cannon and gunsight under Project SIX SHOOTER -- the notion of arming an aircraft solely with AAMs having proven a little too ahead of its time. The cannon had an ammunition supply of 650 rounds and replaced the Genie AAM; arming the F-106 with a nuclear weapon proved troublesome because of the enhanced security and administration required. The F-106B received most of the upgrades as well, though no two-seater ever had the Vulcan cannon.\n\nThe Six was greatly admired by both service and aircrews alike, and in fact one of the reasons that the F-102 tends to be slighted in sources is because the F-106 was such a vast improvement on it. The F-106 was reliable, easy to maintain, and had outstanding performance. Although delta winged aircraft tend to have long takeoff runs because they can\'t usually be fitted with flaps, are hot on landing, and lose speed badly in turns, the F-106 had good handling and was said to be surprisingly agile, its high power-to-weight ratio allowing it to overcome a delta\'s limits on maneuverability. It had few ""funnies"", and gave plenty of stall warning. Pilots regarded it as along the lines of a ""vintage automobile"", with a profound taste of craftsmanship and class. It was phased out of ADC service in the early 1980s, to serve with the Air National Guard until 1988.\n\nThe F-106 never fired a shot in anger. The closest it came to doing so was on 14 May 1960, when a Martin Matador cruise missile ""slipped the leash"" of its radio control during a demonstration. An F-106A shot it down with two Falcons, neither of which had a live warhead. The Sixes also often ""escorted"" Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 ""Bear"" bombers along the US East Coast, the Tu-95s being on the way to Cuba or returning from Cuba, there never being any real trouble in these encounters.\n\nSome sources claim the Dart was used for ""dissimilar air combat training (DACT)"" as an ""aggressor"" for some years because its performance was similar to that of a Soviet Mikoyan MiG-21 fighter. It appears that it was never actually used as a full-time aggressor, but participated in a number of COLLEGE DART exercises during the 1970s that involved DACT. There was some effort to sell the Six to the US Navy for DACT and models were made of the F-106A in disruptive desert camouflage for the role, but it didn\'t happen. Almost 200 Darts were converted into high-speed target drones under the PACER SIX program, with the ""QF-106"" targets serving into 1997.\n\n* As noted above, there were no foreign operators of the F-106. Convair did propose a multirole Dart with an attack capability to Japan, but the Japanese preferred the McDonnell F-4 Phantom. The F-106 was used in some trials work, one interesting configuration involving fit of a GE J85 turbojet under each wing, making this Six a three-engine machine. Another interesting trial involved carriage of the hefty US Navy Standard SAM on an underwing pylons under the SEEKBAT program, with the Standard modified as a fast, long-range AAM to take on Soviet MiG-25 ""Foxbat"" reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nNASA was another user of the F-106, employing it for trials from 1966 to 1998, with the type also being used as astronaut mount for a brief period. One 1998 experiment under the Air Force / NASA Project ECLIPSE involved towing a model of a reusable space launch vehicle to altitude for launch. This Dart was retired on 1 May 1998, and was said to be the last Six to fly. A number of F-106s survive as static displays. None are flying any more.', 'Gotta love the century series.

I got curious and took a look at FlightRadar, and it turns out that it was a Delta 757 being flown from Boston Logan to....Bedford, MA, which is less than 15 miles outside of the city: [https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/dl8848#2047a6aa](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/dl8848#2047a6aa)

There just isn't much there...a couple of general aviation outfits, a bunch of defense contractors have test facilities, but there isn't any sort of regular commercial activity, and I don't think there's any maintenance or anything there.

You only scheduled one day a week? Come in six and nobody will bat an eye). If you're a student you'll find scheduling way easier with a subcontractor than a mainline airline.\n\n\nSuper easy to move up (before 6 months I was already promoted to crew chief, in charge of leading flights and pushing back)\n\nCons of subcontractor:\n\nPay is usually worse than on mainline airlines. Key phrase usually, sometimes you'll find a subcontractor gig that pays pretty decent but most will not.\n\nStaffing is usually real thin, and as a result they can't afford to be picky meaning you'll occasionally work with god awful employees that, regardless of whether or not you like them, the company needs. \n\nAll in all I'm loving it. Studying aviation at a local school while leading flights at an international airport is absolutely bonkers, especially at an age before I can drink a beer.

When compared to the 416 commercially served domestic airports, that fare ranks ATL as the 265th-most expensive airport in the US.   I don't have statistics on international fares, however my experience has placed ATL solidly middle-of-the-road there too.\n\nSome markets out of ATL with heavy competition are incredibly cheap (think ATL-BOS, which has DL, NK, B6, and WN; I consistently grab tickets for less than $75 on that route).  Others with a single carrier are more expensive (e.g. no carrier other than an entrenched hub carrier would even consider flying a route like ATL-DHN).\n\nSome local politicians like to vilify DL and drum up support for a second ATL-metro airport, however this fails to acknowledge the benefits that the current status of the airport brings.  ATL is incredibly efficient, and the super-hub status allows connectivity which is far superior to other cities of ATL's metro size.  ATL is the 11th largest metro area in the US, behind cities like Philadelphia, Houston, and Miami, yet ATL's domestic and international connectivity is far more developed than any of those metro areas (ATL consistently ranks #1 in enplaned passengers, those three rarely break into the top ten).\n\nSure, there's room for increased competition, and competing against an entrenched hub carrier will always be difficult, however I see no barriers in place preventing new entrants. In the past few years, ATL has made room for new routes from AM, B6, 3E, 4B, QR, TK, and WS.

It was interesting because there was a bigger American Airlines plane sitting there at the end of the taxi way just waiting... even after the DC-10 did it's touch and go... I was trying to figure out why it was just waiting... then this Delta comes up the taxi way fast and blows past it, whips onto the runway without hesitation and just goes...  then the American plane went finally went.  \n\nAnyway, we decided to drive over there because we saw the DC-10 doing this wicked circling south east of the airport over Colonie/Wolf Rd. while picking up some fast food.  I said to my wife that they are probably practicing as they do often, so we pulled into the observation parking lot at the end of the runway.  "", "">Is it designed to release excess out the wing in such an instance as to avoid excess pressure in the tanks?\n\nOverfill protection is invariably provided on an airliner either by a dedicated high level sensor which commands the refueling valve closed or by a program inside the refuel/defuel computer that monitors tank quantity. In the event that overflow protection fails, there are vent tubes connected to wing ports that prevent the tank from being over pressurized and bursting by making a huge mess. The DC-9/MD-8X/90/Boeing 717 family have their single point pressure refuel/defuel port in the right wing, which is where he was hooked up. \n\nThe backup safety to this is a little bit of math and common sense.

It's the smell of freedom!  NORMALLY, the vent has a little trap in case fuel gets in there \\(IE: During maneuvering or a go\\-around\\) which just dumps it into the center tank where it makes it way back into the wing tanks via a pump.\n\nFuel systems on jets are actually pretty complex overall \\(more so than you'd think\\), but pretty bulletproof."", ""What airline or country is this?

Homeboy should not have been frigging texting or dozing off or ogling the bag loaders or whatever.\n\nBingo. Thanks for the explanation.', 'I used to be a fueler at a large independent FBO and what I remembered from the maddog is that the auto selectors on electronic panel under the wing next to the single point never worked all that well. The best thing to do was remember each wing safely held about 9300lbs. of fuel and watch it manually. When the fuel reached about 9100lbs. I would close the electronic wing valve switch and the fuel would settle to somewhere around 9300lbs. Everything else went into the center and that was it. \n\nEventually Allegiant decided to start regularly scheduled service into our airport and although we already handled their planes for years via charter service, they had to retrain us to meet their specific company policies. When it came time to fuel their first scheduled flight, I had the training supervisor looking over my shoulder like a hawk. When I showed him the auto selectors didn\'t work and began to do my normal watch the numbers thing, he stopped me and told me that is not ok to do. \n\nNext to the fuel panel is another panel with three manual valves that in my opinion should only be manipulated by maintenance. According to Allegiant\'s training, should the auto selector\'s not work, instead of just electronically opening and closing the valves from the fuel panel, we need to manually open and close the manual valves from this second panel. Kind of stupid because it is almost the exact same function as the electronic panels switches EXCEPT NO PROTECTIONS AGAINST OVERFILLS. \n\nSo this idiot ""shows me hows it done"" and gets the second panel open. There it is clear as mud three valves in a row unmarked. My memory is a little fuzzy on this but it was some stupid order I think instead of following left, center, right logic, the valves went L,R,C. So as will fill all three tanks at the same time, the wings are all about to show full. Numb nuts goes ahead and closes the left and right valves leaving the center one open. Center as in center valve, not center tank. Not 15 seconds later this absolutely giant stream of Jet A comes shooting down out of the overflow vent of the right wing leaving us with all mess just like in the picture. \n\nI walked away and called the fire department. ', ""The gas pump at the corner store *CHUNK*s and shuts itself off automatically when it detects my tank is full.

Or is there always some amount of fuel in any given plane?"", 'Emirates. They tell you to keep seatbelts off while refuelling', 'Emirates, Ethiopian, Brussels, Delta, probably more.

He finishes ok, apu kicks in. All of a sudden the sump tank explodes with fuel spilling all over the place. Come to find out, maintenance left the defuel handle wide open and force closed the panel. Wtf. Plane started draining straight back thru the singlepoint. Haha. Under SOP, we never check that panel. Delay. We check it now. 😔', ""Not really. The way the gas station pump auto-shutoff works involves a small air tube at the top of the pump nozzle, once it becomes submerged in fuel the air pressure drops and the handle clicks off internally. This arrangement works because you're always above your gas tank and there's only one. When it's full, you have all the gas you can carry and that's that. In the US, gas stations typically pump at about 10 gallons per minute. \n\nIt would take literally *hours* to complete a multi-thousand gallon upload (which is not an uncommon amount) at 10 gpm, which is why single port pressure refueling was developed. 30-50 psi through a beefy hose, depending on how high the fuel port is off the ground and how strong your pump is, can give you 250-300 gpm (*particularly large aircraft might even have two refuel ports, giving you as much as 600gpm. Even at that rate, ocean bestriding behemoths like the 777-300ER still have max overall tank capacities in excess of 45,000us gallons*). In any case you're always pumping above you and often dozens of feet off to the side into more than one tank. Most airliners hold considerably more fuel in the center tank than they do in the wings, so making something that automatically terminates fuel flow once the wing tank the refueling port is located at is full defeats the point of the center tank."", ""The tanks are emptied down to zero either when maintenance needs to be performed on the quantity gauging system (or any other component integral to the tank that can't be accessed from the outside) or at scheduled heavy checks. In addition there are tank sump points that are checked periodically for water or other contaminants."", 'Interdasting. Thanks.', 'U bugman ', 'Sounds about right.

Once this level is reached, the fuel will indeed shut off just like at a gas station. Thw difference being that the aircraft no longer accepts more fuel even though the line is still pressurized. There is no clunk sound it just stops pumping.', 'And the trim tanks of an A380 carries more fuel than all the tanks of an A320', '747 blew up because it was going from NYC to Paris and the center tank was EMPTY to do it.

What’s that, like 70 tonnes?', ""All that does is close the same valve that the overflow protection valve closes, just with a different signal. You're right, the truck will keep trying to supply fuel, the only thing stopping a spill is that the airplane shouldn't take any more gas once the valve shuts.

My close friend’s dad is a pilot for Delta and so I was interested in knowing what’s it’s like to be a pilot. He started off by telling me that flight school is really expensive (he went to embry riddle). He also told me before becoming a pilot you have to see if you like flying in general and to try flying with a flight instructor for like $100 solo. Tbh I RARELY see women who are pilots these days and I was wondering why that is & how hard it is to become one in general. I also worry a lot about my future if I become a pilot. Here are some questions I have:

1. Will I get to spend time with my family? 
2. How long will it take me until I start flying commercial? 
3. How can I raise my kids if I’m gonna be gone? 
4. Will I get super lonely on trips?  
5. Do you need a bachelors degree to go to flight school? 
6. Is flight school stressful & hard?
7. Is it true that women in aviation move up the ladder quickly? 
8. Is it too late to start wanting to become a pilot? 

If anyone could answer some of my questions, that would be great! Even if you could only answer one question, I still would appreciate any input if you know anything about women in aviation or have more information about this. I know some people my age who are already completing their private pilots license, but I have no $ or experience whatsoever :(","[""Let's not make this a gendered thing. It's as hard to become a female pilot as it is to be a male pilot."", ""1. Yes, but not on your terms until you have seniority. \n2. Varies (not a commercial pilot; but have many friends who are)\n5. No, but it helps to get a job with an airline later on.\n6. Yes. It is a full-time and very serious committment.\n7. It isn't an easy career path and there is a lot of competition. You have to be at your best, regardless of your gender.\n8. No. Though don't wait until you're 27 or older to start training. That's likely a bit too late IMO.\n\nConsider taking the military track."", '[deleted]', 'One thing I do not recommend doing, is to go to Embry-Riddle.  It is simply too expensive and doesn’t look any better than say UND on a resume.  Good luck to you!', ""Well.. the first issue has a bit of a failmpass to it, though there's a workaround.  So 1) be female. If not get sex change.  This could either be suuuper easy or well.. rather difficult.\n\nSecond.. be a pilot.  This is pretty much the same across the board.  So go to school, pass the tests and gain the hours.\n\nCongrats, you've become a female pilot."", ""Well, I'm no pilot but I am in the industry. I have seen about 1/4-1/8 female (depending on the airline) pilots/first officers.\n\n1.) Most mainline or cargo airline pilots have a lot of time off, it's considered a very good job!\n\n2.) For planes carrying over 100 passengers, you'd need at least 1500 hours in the air. It might actually be 2000 now, though I don't know exactly.\n\n3.) That definitely depends on you and your partner. There is a fair amount of time off as I mentioned, however, if that helps ease fears.\n\n4.)

How much time you get at home will depend on the details of your job, but expect to make sacrifices.\n\n>How long will it take me until I start flying commercial?\n\nSeveral years. With the regulations these days it\'s become harder (in the US anyway) to start flying at airlines so what a lot of people do is work as a flight instructor for a few years until they can move on to a regional airline. \n\n>How can I raise my kids if I’m gonna be gone?\n\nWork something out with your spouse I suppose. Working as an airline pilot means you can\'t be home for dinner every night. \n\n>Will I get super lonely on trips?\n\nThat\'s up to you I suppose.\n\n>Do you need a bachelors degree to go to flight school?\n\nNo\n\n>Is flight school stressful & hard?\n\nYes. Not saying this to discourage you, but it\'s something you need to be willing to accept. And while perhaps it doesn\'t sound inviting it\'s good life experience for sure.\n\n>Is it true that women in aviation move up the ladder quickly?\n\nWomen are still a minority in aviation (outside of say cabin crew). I don\'t know if there\'s any hard evidence on if that makes any difference in terms of career prospects however.\n\n>Is it too late to start wanting to become a pilot\n\nNo', ""Gliders can be a cheap way to start. No engine, you get one shot at nailing the landing every time :/ I do think gliders are a valuable experience.

So according to them, Allegiant, Hawaiian, and Frontier also rank in addition to the 7 above.', 'Not all of them.

Glad I wasn’t the only one.', ""I have flown Delta and American regularly for the past year and Ive been flying AA on and off since the late 90s. Delta has better amenities and Ive had better experiences with their crews (haven't met a DL crew as nice as a PHX based AA crew though). Comfort Plus is also nice for what it is and doesn't have anything comparable on the AA side.\n\nThere isn't that much of difference, but if I have a choice I try to get on Delta."", '(am high) this comment, now reflecting upon it, was a little short-sighted, but i do have my American story.

Flight delayed again because flight attendant could not be located. Added on 2 hrs. more. FINALLY board and as we were taxiing, captain comes on radio and says plane has an issue. Back to terminal. Added on 2-3 more hrs. In total, stuck for almost 7 hrs. But, United has treated me just as shittily. :)', 'But it was joke', 'I guess it depends how far in the weeds you want to get. Yes you can fly United to more destinations than Southwest, but one could argue that Southwest has more mainline operations per day than United, and only has a slightly smaller mainline fleet. You could argue that Southwest has more flights to dispatch than United does and is therefore operationally larger than United. I’d definitely agree though that United is probably more operationally complex than Southwest on several levels. \n\n Skywest, Expressjet, Republic, Commutair, and the rest all have their own operations with their own control centers than handle their own flights that they fly on behalf of United. As far as direct operational control goes, you could argue that the top 4 airlines are all very similarly sized. \n\nAs far as airline size goes it seems to be an argument in semantics (like arguing about on time performance). Largest in terms of destinations, overall fleet size, mainline fleet size, flights per day, total seat miles, revenue seat miles, market cap, profit, employees, and assets will all give slightly different numbers depending on who’s trying to make what argument.', 'Also because Southwest miles are kind of useless because they only work on Southwest- they don’t have partners. Meanwhile, American miles work for any Oneworld carrier, United is in Star Alliance, Delta is in Skyteam, and both Alaska and JetBlue have codeshare agreements\n\nReally the best P/M strategy is to pick an alliance and fly the airline that covers where you’re trying to go within that alliance unless it’s significantly cheaper to fly another airline or not covered in the alliance- Southwest is for infrequent flyers who want a good economy seat and are traveling within the domestic US, it’s not a full service carrier.', 'Then how did I use my Southwest points to book flights from JFK-LAX-SYD in October?\n\nYou can absolutely use your points to book international on other airlines, they just don’t do a great job of advertising it', 'You didn’t look very hard if you didn’t find obvious hubs.

They are a low-cost carrier. There\'s a big difference\n\nEdit: I feel I need to add I am not talking about the DOT definition of ""major carrier"", I am talking about the airline\'s definition.

Same goes for any employee.', 'While it’s true there isn’t much of a difference, if I were you I’d just stick to one and build up points. For you, Delta. I’m 18 years old, but since I fly way too much I’m a member of the AA elite status program earning both elite dollars, miles, and segments allowing me to qualify for platinum pro status when I fly. I started this when my parents got me the secured plan for like 1200 or something which allows you to build the eqd balance. Hopefully I get exec soon but so far sticking to one has been awesome beyond belief.', 'Yeah you can have problems with any airline like that unfortunately.\n\nI love American because if you fly a lot they have by far the best rewards system.

246,Student looking for some insight on my future,1,d9azxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/d9azxd/student_looking_for_some_insight_on_my_future/,1,1569481517.0,"I am a 16 year old high school student that is interested in aviation, and I have already started my ground school through GLEIM. I know that I want to get my private license so I can get my commercial license, but I have some questions.

**Do I need to go to college for a commercial license?** I have asked one of my instructors, and all he said about it was that if I wanted a better chance I would need to go, but I don't NEED to. Basically if I look to apply and someone else is with college is as well they would have a better chance. I have looked into it but ATP has told me that I don't, and other sources have told me bachelors and others said a 4 year. What have you done to get where you are?

&#x200B;

**If I decide to get my commercial, what would be the best thing to do with it?** I was thinking it was more of a ladder sort of thing, like I would go work for a private small company that is official of course, get some hours in flight so I then could look into some commercial airlines like American Airlines or Delta etc.

&#x200B;

**If I can't find any other ways to get experience, is the military a good choice?** I know there are benefits for military that would help my career, such education assistance, but should I do that? How did you get to where you are?

&#x200B;

If there is anything else you would like to explain to me or tell me, I would love to hear about it. I am always looking for some advice or knowledge and I appreciate that you took the time to read this post and maybe reply.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Is there anything I can do right now in highschool that could assist me later in my life related to aviation too, I would like to start as soon as possible so I can secure a career and be stable and the such.","['I’ll start by breaking down the steps to get a career in aviation. (this is the nonmilitary route)\n \nIn order\n* **Private Pilot’s License** 40 - 60 hours\n* **Instrument Rating** 50 - 120 hours\n* **Commercial License** 250 or more hours minimum\n\nCongratulations, you can now make money by flying planes, but you are about 1000 hours short of working for even the little regional jets companies \nFrom here you have a few options you can \n\n* work as a flight instructor\n* crop dust\n* banner flying \n* tours\n* some other small things/ fringe work you would be super lucky to come across\n\nI recommend the former of those options, as my flight instructor told me, “you haven’t really learned it until you have taught it, instruction is something of a rite of passage where you really figure out most of it”\n\nThe good news is you won’t have to be teaching forever, a lot of job opportunities open up around the 500 hour mark\n\n* Aeromedical work\n* Firefighting\n* Charter Companies\n* Private Sector\n* Small plane FedEx/UPS airmail stuff\n* and others\n\nGet hired for one of those companies and fly till you hit the +1250 hour mark (probably atleast +1500) at which point you can take your pick of any of the big airline companies they will hire you, ship you off to a CTP course which they will pay for. You will need to get your ATPL and a type rating as well. \n\nNote you do need to be 23 to get a ATPL **and** act as the Pilot in Command; [you may be a Second in Command at 21]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_transport_pilot_licence#Eligibility)\n\nOh, that’s right you need a degree too, \n\nAs far as I am aware, It **does not matter** what you get a degree in. They don’t care what it’s for because they care that you aren’t going to crash their planes. One of the ways they check for this is that if you were able to complete college, its shows and guarantees that you have some level of responsibility and work ethic. Do something that interests you and it won’t be that bad. \n\nYou can even just do one online while you are working as an instructor or somewhere in that 500 – 1500 hour range just be sure to get it done it will make a huge difference in pay and promotions later on. **Extra +$15,000 a year differences**\n\t\n\n**Here is each of the Stages Broken down by their important steps**\n\nFirst you must get a **Private Pilot’s License** to do so you must have done/obtained\n* 3rd Class Medical\n* Written Ground Test\n* Oral/Practical Exam\n*At least 40 hours of flight experience, and all required training phases and endorsements completed \n\nThis is going to take between $10,000 and $16,000 and 1-4 months depending on how often you can fly and how much effort you put into it. \n> If you have not solo’d by 15-20 hours get a new instructor/ go a new school!\n\nThere are a lot of not great instructors/schools out there that will take your money as they build time and not progress you I’ve met a few people who were at 40-60 hours and had not soloed yet. Good flight schools are out there, you may just need to find them. \n\nNext you will be best off getting your **Instrument Rating** and **Multi-Engine Rating** if money is an issue you only need to get the instrument rating\n\nWhile you are getting your instrument rating you should also take these tests\n* **IRA** Instrument Airplane Rating\n* **FII** Instrument Flight Instructor\n* **IGI** Instrument Flight Instructor \n\nThey are basically the same test and it means you won’t have to take them later when you are going for your CFI /CFII \n\nSimilarity for Commercial \n\n* **CAX** Commercial Pilot Airplane\n* **AGI** Advanced Ground Instructor\n* **FIA** Advanced Flight Instructor\n\nYou will also need to work in **FOI** Fundamentals of instruction this one isn’t really grouped as it’s more a course on teaching rather then airplanes, it is required before CFI however. \n\nLastly Ill leave off with a few notes:\n\n* after you get your instrument you will have a sea of about 100 or so hours to build before you can get your commercial license. I would recommend building this time with a partner, this way you can split the cost of the airplane and both of you get to log hours\n\n\n* Financially, this is going to be a lot of money and you won’t see a return on investment for quite a while, just to get to start making maybe $20/ hours as a flight instructor its going to be $40,000 - $60,000 [(I made this cool calculator a month ago)]( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JeQRNhsFtW6jJpJlmQoYKEkD0HZ2SYko?usp=sharing) add that to college and it’s well… a lot. One day it will all start coming back to you and with the aviation job market as it is right now, you get the hours and you are pretty much guaranteed work for the rest of your life until you are forced into a comfortable retirement from the airlines at 65 making after making 120k/year where you can hang out at your local FBO and tell stories to anyone who will listen.\n\n\n* If cost is a prohibiting factor, Air force is a great option, Navy if you are more interested in fighter jets. Keep yourself in shape and talk to your local recruiting officer. In my experience Air Force recruiters are usually pretty chill and aren’t as quick to promise you the world for joining as some other branches are. Retire at like 34 and join any airline you want with a military pension giving you extra cash for life. (This is not my area of expertise please don’t quote me on this section )\n\n\n* Aviation College route is totally fine as well, not necessary, but they will keep you on track, get you a degree, and their programs are designed to make you hirable (this is not including non-college part 131 schools)\n\n\n* I recommend against schools like ATP, while not the worst thing in the world, you must be the best to succeed here. Flight training is given out by people who just earned their own licenses by people who just earned theirs, ectera. Training is poor and pilots often have to go to another school afterwards to learn things that were skipped/missed/or just not taught well. \n\n\n* Lastly, I’m not too sure where you are at with your flight training or if you have even started. Its going to be a lot of fun at first but then will come the day where realize that there is a lot to learn and its not easy at all. Just keep at it and if you really do enjoy flying that much, it shouldn’t be a burden. There is nothing wrong with keeping aviation as a hobby though, but don’t give up for lack of trying. \n\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions', '[deleted]']"
