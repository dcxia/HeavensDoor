Some people claimed they did. I'm trying to obtain status match for Delta and they need a copy of a physical or digital membership card that confirms I have status. Has anyone done this? What did you provide for the membership card?",['You can probably just give them your number? Call 1800jetblue and ask them for it.']
1,Internship,5,d0qjtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/d0qjtn/internship/,1,1567852860.0,"Hello guys,

Not sure if anyone here can help me or even point me in the right direction, but you have to start somewhere. I am a Sophomore at FSU studying meteorology, I am putting together a list of internships I would like to apply to for Summer 2020 (I know it's a little early and many companies have not posted openings). I was wondering if JetBlue had any type of Summer internship in meteorology available as other airlines like Southwest and Delta do. Thank you in advance.","['JetBlue has a program called the JET (JetBlue Emerging Talent) Internship. Their website is www.work-here.jetblue.com, and they post their internship opportunities throughout the year. I’ve seen internships in flight operations, training, finance, and other assorted facets of the company. The job portal will specify if the internship is a summer program. \n\nBest of luck!']"
2,JetBlue legroom question,5,aclg3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/aclg3z/jetblue_legroom_question/,12,1546657800.0,How is the leg room on the JetBlue A321 flights? I am making a cross country flight (west coast to east) and usually have flown Delta Comfort+ but I'm wondering how JetBlue's legroom would compare. Would I be correct in assuming I should be looking for Even More Space seating?,"['[deleted]', 'How tall are you? The extra space seats are more legroom than I need at 5\'2"", but could be nice on a longer flight. Plus they give you priority boarding, so they might be worth looking into. ', 'JetBlue all the way. The service alone is worth it. I avoid the big three if possible: AA, United, and Delta.', 'You’ll be fine. I’m 6’ and have no problems in economy transcontinental. An empty seat beside me is a blessing though!', 'I\'m 6\'5"" and I\'m fine in the regular seats even though I spring for EMS sometimes (usually more for the early boarding though).', 'Jet blue has no leg room! I paid extra for it and couldn’t straighten my legs out past 90 degrees!! Fuck jet blue!!!!', 'Ok, thanks! ', 'I’m 5’8” so not the tallest but it would be nice to have more legroom on a cross country flight. ', 'I don’t mind Delta, never had a problem when flying with them but I can’t stand AA or United. ', 'Great, thanks for the info. And yeah, an empty adjacent seat is always fantastic. ', 'Appreciate the info!', ""You'll be fine. Jetblue economy on the A320 and A321s are great."", ""You're welcome. ""]"
3,Worst experience,1,8gxz8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/8gxz8n/worst_experience/,1,1525455206.0,"Had one of the worst experience today. Flight got delayed and missed all my connecting international flights. Jetblue booked next ticket which was after 12 hours and didn't provide accommodation or food.

  


Will never use the service again. Delta is best

4,Questions about Internet and device charging on JFK-LAX flight,2,7kiwth,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/7kiwth/questions_about_internet_and_device_charging_on/,2,1513599814.0,"I recently flew cross country on Delta and on United. Delta had an App I had to download that gave me access to limited content. To get the Internet, I would have had to pay $40. I chose not to. Delta provided zero ways for me to keep my phone charged. United was the same story, but at least they had USB ports.

What should I expect from JetBlue in this regard? I just want access to the Internet and a way to charge my phone.","['If you’re flying on a cross country like ny to/from California they use the A321 which all have in seat usb chargers....some of the 320s have usb chargers but not all\n\nAs far as the internet, it’s free the whole ride', 'Free wifi on the flight and the usb charger should be located undr your seat between your legs']"
