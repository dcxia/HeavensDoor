0,Delta customer service at DTW,12,d60cm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/d60cm7/delta_customer_service_at_dtw/,6,1568853274.0,"Last week the airport got hit with severe storms which wreaked havoc on flight schedules. Our 8pm flight wound up getting delayed until the next morning because the inbound flight crew couldn't land in time. The Delta gate agents handled this perfectly!

* They kept most passengers in the terminal, rather than on the aircraft. Even compared to a roomy 330 (to say nothing of a CRJ), the terminal is MUCH more comfortable.
* They wheeled out carts with free snacks and water. Nothing fancy, just your typical in-flight snacks ... but very much appreciated.
* Every gate agent was able to handle the situation. You don't know how big of a deal this is. Instead of waiting in the 15+ people line at our gate, I was able to find a gate agent who appeared to be not busy (no aircraft at her gate, no people in her area) and asked if she could help. She was happy to!
* They were not only able to book us on a much later (same night) flight to an airport near our final destination, but they were able to keep our seat upgrades. Fantastic! We wound up renting a car and driving the 100 miles home, but it just made our anniversary trip into an adventure.
* Our bags actually made it onto our new aircraft. This is the part that always makes me nervous with last-second flight changes, but our bags were waiting for us at our new destination!
* Best of all, the crew remained calm and helpful. Nobody was happy with the situation, but they did the best they could.

I know we see a ton of complaints in here so I wanted to do something a little different and give a huge shout out to the DTW Delta staff working the storms last Wednesday night!

Also, this was my first time flying through DTW. I've got to say it was not at all what I expected. It has a very comfortable ""small town airport"" feel but was actually huge.","['You should send an email to Delta about this.', 'Delta is mostly good compare to others American carriers', 'DTW (specifically the Delta/McNamara terminal) is one of the best and underrated airports in NA.', ""Inside the US I only fly Delta and that is largely because they're the only American airline I trust to have their shit together.

1,"Delta canceled our flight due to weather, then lost our rebooking information.

Fast forward to this morning. We arrived three hours before our flight to discover that Delta had incorrectly rebooked us and our reservation no longer exists in their system, despite having a confirmation code and the paper itinerary the agent printed for us.

So my SO and I are flying to the states for the first time in August via Delta and I'm concerned about the best options for our little one, as we're having her on our laps (this is due to cost but may be a *terrible* idea as she's pretty active). 

I've seen on Delta's site they mention child safety seats and CARES harnesses, but nothing that tells you whether they provide any of these (probably not the car seat). We're currently of the idea we'll have the little on on our laps/walk around etc, but we know she'll totally kick off at some point. 

So my main concerns are - 

* will she need a ticket even if she's on our laps?
* does the airline supply the seats/harness they mention on their site? (obv she'll need a seat if this is the case).

Thanks everyone!","[""I believe she'll need her own ticket even with her being on your lap due to it being an International flight and I think it's going to be 10% of the adult fare."", ""Infants get their own ticket.

5,"Flight cancelled with AA, found another on Delta and AA won't help. Need to vent.",0,ca9axc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/ca9axc/flight_cancelled_with_aa_found_another_on_delta/,28,1562548936.0,"My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

Regular economy only had 3 or 4 person per row area configuration. 

So I made the purchase a while ago, got the confirmation, saw the charge on my card and was done. A few days later I noticed the money was returned to my card. Worried we had lost our seats, I log into delta, but our seats are still confirmed. 

I think I need to call delta and confirm this all over again and maybe pay them again but my buddy is telling me that I'll be charged at check in or that I got the seats for free since I'm a (really low level) reward member.

Delta in particular will most-times always be *more* expensive, because they believe that they offer a high-quality product (flight) that customers will charge more for... and they're actually not wrong- a lot of frequent fliers *do* shell out more money for the experience, comfort, and security that comes with it. \n\nService and in-flight experience can vary vastly across airlines- on a budget regional like Frontier you're going to get the bare minimum. They may give you half a can of soda, or a bag of pretzels, but that's all. They will *not* let you bring a carry-on suitcase (unless you pay a fee), and checking a bag also incurs a fee. All the airlines will normally make around $150-$200 off you at least per flight, be it on the ticket price or on additional fees like bags. \n\nDelta (or any of the big 3: American, Delta, United) offers a complimentary carry-on luggage, so if you're not going on a long vacation and can bring the carry-on you can avoid the $50 bag fee.

Yes in the end if everything goes perfectly it's the same: a flight from A to B. But Delta offers a lot more, from more comfort as the most immediately obvious one (those three inches may not seem like much but if you aren't a midget you'll soon find out just how much that really is) to the best on-time performance in the US to a much larger amount of routes, partners and staff. And it's when the shit hits the fan that that becomes important.\n\nOn Sun Country if there's a problem you can be fucked until the next day, and possibly longer if that flight is full enough that they can't find you a seat on it.

They'll then also give you the option of changing whatever the fuck you want around in case their new booking doesn't fit your schedule. And if Delta for some reason can't fit you on one of their own flights because they're all full, they'll put you on a partner carrier's flight.

Please for the love of God stop telling me it was the weather and just address my question. Thank you. 


My parents (68 & 66) recently went on a cruise and were trying to go back home to North Dakota. They were supposed to fly out of Miami, Florida with a connecting flight in Minneapolis, MN.

At 9:20pm (Eastern time) January 27 mom texted me ""We got on our plane late, had a delay on the runway, were conserving power, and then they couldn't get the plane started again. We're back in the Miami terminal waiting for another plane, but we won't make our connecting flight.""

I'm not sure how long the delay on the runway was. 

Mom let me know they got rebooked but it's going to leave over 4 hours later.
""Now we are looking at leaving at 1:00 am [January 28] They rebooked us to Bismarck tomorrow night, but said to check tomorrow to see if there are cancellations on an earlier flight.""

Mom texted me at 12:41AM (Central time)  that they got to Bismarck. That is on January 29th.

To me, this is unbelievable. Mom's notoriously nonconfrontational so I'd like to see if she's entitled to some compensation. I'm sure my dad was livid but this is outside his usual scope as he's never been the travel planner and doesn't even know how to use his flip phone very well. They're both in pretty decent health but mom hasn't had a great immune system since she had cancer 15ish years ago so I'm positive she'll catch some kind of cold, especially with this extended amount of time in the airports.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get some kind of compensation from Delta? Are there particular phrases I should use that seem to have better results, etc.? United has a policy on delays not related to weather and I can't believe Delta doesn't have anything on their website about compensation.

I dont mind paying a little more to fly with an airline that is generally going to provide a better experience.,"['It all depends upon what you purchase.  For domestic flights, if you\'re going for First Class level, all three of the major airlines (Delta, American, United) are similar enough and will generally give you a good experience.  JetBlue has ""Mint"" service on some routes that is also very nice.  Note, though, that if your flight is less than 3 hours, it really isn\'t cost-effective to pay extra for First class.  In economy, again, the three biggies are similar.  But, Delta tends to rise just a bit higher with a tad more room, IFE, and just a generally better experience.  However, they also tend to be a little more expensive.  Alaska Air and JetBlue also have a good economy setup.  You can spring for ""Comfort Plus"" or ""Economy Extra"" (or various other names for the same service) that will afford you slightly more legroom but in an economy seat.  American and United just give you more legroom in this section, but no other amenities.  Delta, in their Comfort +, gives you more legroom and additional amenities like priority boarding, free drinks,  upgraded snacks.  \n\nLCCs, or ""Low Cost Carriers"" like Spirit, Frontier, and others, give you the worst experience.  They\'ll get you to your destination, but often at the expense of your comfort and convenience.  Many times, because they charge extra for things the others include in their fare, the price may turn out to not be as good of a bargain as you\'d think.  Also, be sure you\'re not getting a ""Basic Economy"" fare on any of the airlines.  Those are rarely a real bargain as you\'re often limited on what you can carry on, can\'t select your seats, board last, and are often stuck in a middle seat away from your travel mates.\nSo, my advice: pick any of the major airlines (Delta, American, United, JetBlue, Alaska) and if the flight is around 3 hours or less, just get an ""Economy Plus"" (Comfort +, Main Cabin Extra, Premium Economy, etc.) and enjoy your trip!', 'First class', 'All the major US Airlines (American, Delta, Southwest, United) are fairly similar in quality.

If you pay for ""premium"" which is not much more than normal economy you get free drinks like the good ol days.', 'JetBlue!!!', 'The best airlines don’t fly to Las Vegas', 'I would add that Southwest is usually perceived as better than the other LCCs and I personally prefer some aspects of the passenger experience compared to economy on other carriers (particularly the boarding process and cost for things like wifi and drinks).', 'Just to add to this, if you do want to travel in style, first class is the way to go. Especially if you could fly with Alaska airlines, because they allow you to use the airport lounge prior to your flight- there are free snacks and free flowing drinks, which is nice. In the event there’s no Alaska, or no first class (or if first is too prohibitively expensive), a great middle ground is to fly in an economy plus seat. As /u/massiveconcern has said, there is more legroom and (at least with American Airlines) free flowing drinks in the air (if that’s your thing). I mean you are headed to Vegas after all.']"

Booking honeymoon from Ohio to Italy for feb or March of 2020. Must be feb 16 or after. Any time in March. Two week trip. Literally any date in that time frame is fine. Also willing to do 13 day trip or 15 if that gets me a deal. 

A lot of search options but I can’t seem to find anything lower than 1200 each. 

Preferred departure from Dayton Ohio, will also depart from cincinnati or Columbus. 

Will fly into Venice, Florence, wherever I can get the best deal. 

So far I’ve looked mainly at flying into Venice or Rome and flying out of the opposite. 

Checked Skyscanner, google, kayak. 

Also checked delta, American Airlines, and United’s website specifically. 

I will pay 1200 each ticket if that’s what’s required, but I’m trying to find the best deal possible. 

Any sites I’m missing? I don’t know if I have too many search possibilities and that’s why it’s more complicated for me to search effectively.

We have a guest from Australia visiting us in the USA for most of October. She'll make 3 stops in the US. Here's what I'm trying to do:

* SYD to DTW, preferably with the layover at LAX. Stay in Detroit for about a week. Based on my research, this is almost certainly a Delta flight.

* DTW to CLT, for which Delta offers a nonstop, stay a week in that area.

* CLT area airports (3 available) to LAX preferably nonstop so this can't be Delta. Again, stay about a week.

* LAX to SYD.

I want to avoid layovers as much as possible. There seems to be no way to do SYD -> DTW without stopping once, but the rest of the legs can all be done nonstop.

I would like the two overseas flights to be in premium seats, the equivalent of domestic first class, but not the overseas first class that turn into beds. I would like the domestic flights to be the equivalent of Delta's ""Comfort+"" class.

I also don't want to make her pull her (checked) bags back through security at LAX during the first leg of the flight, so that flight seems like it needs to be booked as SYD to DTW with a layover, instead of as two separate flights SYD -> LAX then LAX -> DTW.

The only ideas I have about how to pull this off are:

* Buy a multi-city flight on Delta with legs SYD -> LAX for layover -> DTW, then LAX -> SYD. Buy the other 2 flights as one-way tickets.

* As above, but include the DTW -> CLT flight in the Delta multi-city plan. I would normally use Comfort+ for this, but if it's First because I want the overseas flights to be that, it's not the end of the world.

* Call a travel agent.

I think I just talked myself into calling a travel agent. What do you all think?

I'm out of college now. Even though the buddy pass (S4) is not an amazing deal, the flexibility is excellent. My life is a little unpredictable and it would be worth it just to be able to cancel if something arose.

I would like to fly to Italy around March 19th, but I am flexible anytime between the 19th and the 26th. I'd like to return mid-April. I can fly out of JFK, Boston, or Bradley. I do understand Bradley would be a pain in the ass, but I'm just mentioning it because I *could* do it. 

I don't care which city I fly into as long as it's on the train network, but either Milan or Rome are ones I've focused on.

The worry has just come up that I might have to deal with completely booked flights in late March. I am of course willing to travel any class (Delta One would be super neato but that's probably a pipe dream).

So I'd really like anyone with experience to tell me if I should book a confirmed flight out and just use a buddy pass for the return or if there's a good chance I'll be able to get a standby seat.

Now, it seems increasingly likely that I may have to make this trip to India much sooner than anticipated (late-August instead of mid-November). What are the most practical options?

1. Will Air France reschedule my itinerary to August without any penalties? My ticket is a refundable ticket with a $135 penalty and a $100 change fee.
2. If option 1 doesn't work out, and if I have to reschedule the dates, will I have to pay the fare difference on top of the change fee? The fare difference is currently in the 1000's of $s.
3. If neither option 1 nor 2 work out, will I be able to cancel without a penalty, considering my original itinerary was set to depart on Nov. 17 and also considering the changed itinerary was further changed multiple times?

Saturday, April 27th, we had our American Airlines flight (executed by British Airways) to London Heathrow, where we had our connecting flight to JFK by American Airlines. Due to Weather conditions (They said so), our flight got delayed, so we couldn’t make it on our second flight to JFK (This flight even departed earlier). We were told to go to the connections desks, which after a long wait told us we had to stay at a hotel and leave the next morning to catch our rebooked Lufthansa flight to Frankfort (FRA). Here we had another connecting flight to JFK from Delta. When we arrived slightly late at Frankfurt Airport we ran to catch our next Delta flight. We didn’t even had the Check-in tickets yet; this caused us to never make in in time and we yet again got us rebooked at a British Airways Helpdesk. At the end, all 4 of us would split up in 2 groups to still arrive at JFK in the evening of Sunday, we insisted in doing it, as our last hope. We went as fast as we could to the Lufthansa Helpdesk to get our tickets, but they said the information provided by British Airways was not complete and the time period was way to narrow to still make the flight. After this huge disappointment we decided to cancel our trip, since our 5 days at New York would turn to 3, which just wouldn’t made it worth it.

With our already more than 24 hours delay, our airline clearly made some big mistakes. Off course we cannot help the first delay (since weather conditions), but getting rebooked twice on flights that were impossible to make (the Lufthansa helpdesk employee that tried to get our tickets confirmed this) is just not right. Now I wondered who is responsible for the mistakes made on our flights; American Airlines or British Airlines and what would be possible in terms of claims or other solutions. 

(\*My English isn’t the best, so I hope everything is clear ;)","['This sounds so messy because so many parties are involved. The ticket belongs to American Airlines but you were never to even speak to an AA employee because of codeshares. \n\nYour British Airways flight was delayed because of weather (plausible), so they rebooked you on Lufthansa connecting to Delta. BA is in Oneworld, Lufthansa is in Star Alliance, and Delta is in Skyteam... normally airlines like to rebook you on their own airline or at least within their own alliance. The fact that BA put you on LH and DL tells me that seats were scarce and they were doing their best to avoid making you wait days for a seat the next available seat on BA. BA has a reputation for being less than helpful so I’m surprised they did this for you.  \n\nHowever, there are some unspoken risks when you have a BA agent rebooking an AA ticket on LH and DL... ticket changes can be complex within one alliance so when you get 3 involved you are just asking for something to be missing from the exchange causing a headache down the line. To make it worse, a lot of airport employees have been outsourced and their systems dumbed down so few know what to do when these unusual situations arise. BA might have done everything perfectly during the reissue, but maybe the Lufthansa system didn’t talk to Delta as it should have causing the boarding passes not to print in time causing you to miss connect in Frankfurt. \n\nGood luck getting any of these airlines to take the blame. You can start with AA, but they will probably tel you to go to one of the airlines that you were actually going to fly on. BA will probably tell you to talk to Lufthansa because they should have made sure you were checked in. Delta won’t do anything because they will say the exchange was done wrong by BA or LH. All of them will probably tell you to go to Expedia who will say “we can’t do anything because the airlines took over the ticket so contact AA”. In a way they will all be correct which really sucks for you. \n\nYou can try trip in vain, but those tend to work only for 1 or 2 day trips. \n\nGood luck!', 'was your original flight an AA flight number or BA? if AA its AA, if BA its BA.', 'try mentioning ""trip in vain"" - flight is so delayed that the trip would be useless.

I was told I would be contacted when my bag arrived, which never happened even after I visited the airport to ask. When I visited, the crew did a thorough sweep of all their bags and didn't find it. I was advised to contact Delta to look in JFK or ATL (which was my original connection from Denver but I switched last minute due to buddy pass/standby). 

After 21 days I filed a missing bag claim where I thoroughly described contents of bag to which Delta replied they were sorry and couldn't find my bag and a check would arrive in 10 business days to pay for items reported in the claim and to replace the luggage. 

The check arrived Tuesday this week and my parents deposited the check for me on Wednesday morning (since I'm still in Spain). I used part of the money from the check to pay for my *flight home* and also to pay for a new suitcase since I was required to buy new clothes in Spain since the lost bag contained all of my clothes.

Now Delta has found my bag and apparently called my mom leaving a message saying not to deposit the check and they would tell us what the next steps are, but the check has already been deposited. 

***TL;DR -*** My question is, is Delta somehow going to require me to give this money back? Or is this a benefit I am entitled to since I've been without my luggage -- and all of my clothes -- for 6 weeks?","[""This will be tricky. Clearly, Delta can't ask for all the money back since they would have had to reimburse you anyway for the stuff you had to buy for the time till your bag showed up. Six weeks is quite some time so obviously two t-shirts and a pair of underwear won't cut it. \n\nI'm clearly no lawyer but I'd say that the absolute maximum Delta could ask for is the difference of what you spent and what they gave you.

Most E arrivals are Delta and partner airlines, so the majority will be connecting.  Everything is designed to go fast... no one can accidentally miss bag recheck, and the security is quick like one big TSA Pre Check. \n\nAn added benefit for Delta is that this also keeps people living in Atlanta from buying cheaper tickets tickets that end somewhere.  Atlanta is not always a cheap city to fly from on Delta, especially on all the nonstops. In days past you could buy a DL ticket for say Atlanta-Buenos Aires-Miami (via Atlanta).

Pretty dumb question but this is my first time with KLM to go to Prague, Czech Republic from Southern California.

From there, Amsterdam to Prague is operated by KLM.

I never really had to pay for my baggage this this kind of sucks but it seems like $25 bucks for Delta and $40 bucks of KLM.

But since my baggage will be checked in the whole time and I won't need it until Prague, hopefully I will only have to pay it once.

106,Caught between two airlines!,1,b29op4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/b29op4/caught_between_two_airlines/,6,1552883822.0,"Hello r/flights. I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this but I’m in a major predicament.

In November I booked flights to India via Delta for spring break. I’m a student and this year of my studies is very busy, so this is the only time I have. Because of that, I paid more to book with Delta under the impression they would be available to correct problems if they arise. I was only going to be here for 7 days and I’m didn’t want to spend it on the phone with the airline. Two weeks before I arrived, my grandfather passed away. I was both crushed and relieved I’d be here to support my grandmother and help around the house. I just want to spend my remaining time here doing the small things that make family so precious like seeing her and talking to her.

Unfortunately, Delta and Jet Airways have other plans for my time here. Jet Airways cancelled my flight back on Saturday, I only know this because my dad is attempting to get a flight home and asked to be on the same flight as me, Jet Airways told him they can’t do that because the flight is gone. I haven’t received any email notification of this cancellation from Delta or Jet Airways, nor is this information available in the Delta app. They also told him there are no other flights back on Saturday, so to arrive in time to being my classes, I would have to leave a day earlier - cutting my 7 day trip to 6. I am of course very sad about this, but I understand that things happen and sometimes you get the short end of the stick on that.

Which brings me to my problem. My dad, recognizing that I would need new flights, asked the folks at Jet Airways to help him rebook the flights while we were at the airport (a 3 hour trip from my grandmother’s home). They said they cannot rebook any part of the trip because I booked it via Delta. So, I contacted Delta via twitter DMs. (It would be 50 cents per minute to call Delta, which could get astronomical with this issue and the notorious customer service hold). They told me they will rebook me to be with my dad, but that I need to contact Jet Airways to get my flight with them rebooked. When I call the Jet Airways number, no one picks up the phone and, as I said, the person I spoke with in person said he quite literally could not change the booking. Even if I wanted to talk to him again, I’d have to go 3 hours by car. After 3 hours of trying to get Delta to do something, they sent a message saying I needed to contact Jet Airways “for my protection” and that there was “no where further to escalate the issue.”

While I’m certainly honored that Delta had the CEO himself DM me on Twitter, I’m also feeling quite stuck. As you can imagine, I can’t afford to just pay for a new flight at the last minute (especially with ticket prices skyrocketing from other problems with Jet Airways), I don’t want to spend my remaining few days spending quality time with airline customer service representatives, and I do very much need to be home to continue my studies. 

Any advice is much appreciated. Good advice is preferred.

About two weeks ago, I purchased a ticket on Delta Airlines through Kayak. Everything was fine, up until New Years Eve - the day before my flight. On New Years Eve, I attempted to check-in to my flight and received an error message saying I had to check-in at a kiosk. Now nervous about my ticket, I decided to travel to the airport at 10:30pm on New Years Eve to make sure everything was okay. Upon arrival, I entered my flight details into a kiosk, as I was earlier told to do, and received another error message: Please see a Ticketing Agent. 

Now I was very worried so I decide to call Delta customer service. At first, I was told my ticket was ""randomly selected"" in a control process, and I must bring my credit card that I used to purchase my ticket to the kiosk in order to get my tickets. Problem is... I had just received a new credit card in the mail two days ago and didn't have the original. I told the representative this, and he said it would be fine, as long as I have my driver's license on my person. But the explanation sounded fishy to me... and I was still nervous.

So I called Delta customer service again and this time got a supervisor. The supervisor told me my purchase was flagged as fraud by their internal fraud team **during the 5 minutes I spent purchasing the ticket through Kayak. How odd is that??** For that reason, I must bring my original credit card to the counter in order to get my tickets ... which I don't have. After spending nearly 1.5 hours dealing with this on New Years Eve... the supervisor refunded and reissued my ticket on my new card.

However the issue still remains ... ***what if I hadn't been suspicious of Delta's initial explanation***? I wouldn't have been able to get on my flight. Their security requirement of bringing the original card for suspected fraudulent transactions initially sound reasonable. But what if this had been a family member purchasing a ticket for their child in another state? Or a similar situation of someone who recently got a new credit card? Anyone could easily miss a trip they had already paid for because of this. Worse yet, if Delta wants to put their customers through a ""fraud review"", shouldn't they have more information about their customer than a three minute on-line purchase with Kayak? Shouldn't they have an obligation to notify the customer with a huge advisory notice on their ticket confirmation that additional credit card information is needed at the airport to validate travel?

Posting on here to see if anyone else has experienced this.

111,Lost Baggage. Delta/WestJet,2,6cdvur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/6cdvur/lost_baggage_deltawestjet/,5,1495357120.0,"Hi,

Yesterday (May 19) I flew on a Delta flight that was operated by WestJet. I checked my bag with WestJet and that they are who printed the baggage sticker. It's a WestJet number. The flight was WS 1100 from Toronto to Los Angeles. The flight was meant to be a layover, and then today I flew from LAX to Ixapta/Zihuantenjo (Mexico) on a Delta operated flight DL 645.

When I arrived in LAX yesterday, my bag never came out of the turnstile. Toronto was the last I saw it. I notified both WestJet and Delta (who are right beside each other at LAX) but neither cared and didn't ultimately know who was responsible for it, and how to proceed, or how the bag even goes from Toronto ultimately to Mexico. Yesterday, one lady at Delta baggage services (LAX) told me my bag would ultimately end up in Mexico today , since the flight to LAX was a layover. Still she couldn't actually verify this. That was really the only attempt at an answer I got.

Well today came and when I got off the DL 645 there was no bag here in Mexico.

My question is how do I proceed with this? Neither Delta or WestJet knows how to track it. I don't even know if it made it from Toronto to Los Angeles on WS 1100, let alone from LA to Mexico today.

Please. Anything would help.

I realize that Southwest was considered one of the ""good ones,"" but I'm now shopping for a new airline. I fly between Dallas and DC 25+ times a year for work.

Problem is, I already have reasons to hate American and United, pretty much the only other options I have (I have no reasons to hate Delta but they are never a low enough airfare for me to expense it).

I have Southwest A-List but it looks like status matching isn't an option for me, because American has that weird status challenge program that I don't think I'd be able to meet the requirements for (nor do I want to pay for the privilege of trying it), and I already have Premier Silver at United through my Marriott Platinum Elite status.

This is especially true if it's because you expect people to move even though you didn't pony up for the reservation.  I've seen and heard of too many stories of families with small children getting split up because they didn't pay the fee.  I don't think it's right - I would much prefer the system some of the European carriers use where they automatically seat families with accompanying children together without requiring a seat reservation.  But most US airlines don't make this distinction in their software so they can and will do it.  Roll the dice if you will.  It's one thing if it's two adults.

1. 20th April TLV (Tel Aviv) - LAX (Los Angeles International)
2. 3rd May LAX - AMS (Amsterdam Schipol)
3. 6th May AMS - TLV

After searching on Google Flights (multi-city, 1 adult, business), I found the ideal itinerary for \~$2800 (numbers correspond):

1. Iberia (sold by American) A330s changing at Madrid
2. BA (sold by American)  A380 / A320 changing at LHR London Heathrow
3. BA A321 / 777 also changing at LHR

When I clicked on the ""book with American Airlines"" button, it took me to American's booking portal. It didn't specify (there) if the flights were indeed business or economy. There was a clue that it said two checked in bags, but nothing other than that. When I tried the same itinerary direct on their site (not via Google Flights), there were differences:

* The third leg flight wasn't available.
* The lowest business price was higher (around $3500).
* The flights were shown as ""Business"" etc.

So rather than book, I called AA. They were mostly unhelpful (friendly but I could tell the rep didn't have deep system knowledge), but said ""the integration with Google Flights can be funny, try booking it, then you can call us with the booking reference and we can confirm, you have 24 hours to get a full refund"".

So I hit refresh to book, and suddenly, the $2800 had become $3700 for the same trip! I don't know if this is bad luck, if the rep flagged some anomaly in the system, or  if hitting refresh a lot as I searched around, and sending the links to my colleagues, was a schoolboy error.

I can't believe that this itinerary suddenly became so popular as to go from $2800 to $3700. What's the smartest thing to do next? Should I wait a few days and search again? Is there any way to know if this is the system artificially inflating prices, or did I just get really unlucky and the price happened to jump whilst I was on the phone with the rep? If it's the former, how long will the prices take to come back down to earth (relatively)?

Ever.,0,4mtnnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/4mtnnv/xpost_from_rtravel_never_flying_delta_again_ever/,9,1465257544.0,"My girlfriend and I booked a round-trip flight from Boston to Orlando for a vacation. The trip was booked months in advance. Prior to our trip I actually called to change our connecting flight in the return leg of the trip (through Laguardia) and was assisted wonderfully by the Delta team. 

However, yesterday, we arrived to MCO at approximately 8:30 AM due to an earlier than expected return from our cruise. Our flight time was not till 15:45 so I attempted to change our tickets to one of two earlier flights to Laguardia (one at 11:45 and one at 13:55). I was told that due to our ticket (Basic Economy) we could not be moved to an earlier flight despite there being room on said flight. While I understand this is in the very fine print of the original purchase (as was incredibly rudely asserted to me on multiple occasions), I explained and begged that I would pay for an upgrade and any additional fee. Instead I was told that if we wanted to get to Boston sooner, we'd have to re-book completely and it would cost $400 per person. 

At this point, we felt defeated and headed to our gate. When we got to our gate, we received notice that our original flight (scheduled for 15:45) was now delayed till 18:45, turning our 7 hour day at the airport into a 10 hour day. Worse yet, this delay would have meant a missed connection at Laguardia, so we needed to completely change flights. 

I went to customer service and was told that NOW there was no longer space on either of the earlier flights and we are being rebooked through Atlanta at 19:30 and arriving to Boston at 00:45 the following day. 

Both of these flights were also delayed, and we left MCO at 20:30, barely making our connection to Boston and arriving at Logan at 1:20 AM on flight DL2300 from Atlanta. 

Had we been rebooked (even at a fee!) at 8:00 AM that morning, none of this would have happened. Every customer service rep at MCO was incredibly rude and dismissive, and when they did try to help they had very little knowledge of the flights available (for example, after being placed on the ATL flight, I was offered to be placed back on the delayed Laguardia flight, despite the fact that doing so would have gauranteed being stuck overnight in New York. Had I not pointed it out MYSELF to the agent at the desk, they would have rebooked us on that flight. 

I sit at work now, having gotten 3.5 hours of sleep last night, our luggage still in Laguardia, after spending 12 hours at MCO and a total of 18 hours trying to get home for Orlando to Boston. 

In that time, I could have driven home faster. Throughout the ordeal I was treated as second-class (sorry, they called it E-class) and never once offered anything (even an apology) for the worst day of my life.

Back in May I visited my hometown for a doctor's appointment. I only have two days off a week, so I had arranged to catch the first flight back on the third day so as to make it to work on time in the evening. 

Like an idiot I overslept and completely missed my flight. I just started 2 months earlier in my job and already had been late that week by 2 hours because honestly I was drinking and told myself that I would wake up in time. I did not. I didn't want to fess up that I'm an irresponsible asshole, so I told my work that the flight was delayed.

At that I caught the next available flight and at the connecting airport, I realize that there's a flight *sooner* and I just might be able to make it to work on time. I pay extra to switch to that flight (I believe a 14:00) to catch it from DTW to LGA. My luck, that flight was *actually* delayed. I arrived late but not too late that I was useless, and the next day I got a warning by my boss and my boss' boss and it actually has to be signed by the president in the end. I just took it and didn't try to fight it because I knew I deserved it. 

This was months ago. Since that incident, I got my act together. I severely cut back my drinking because I realized there are more important things in life, and I HAVE NOT BEEN LATE SINCE THAT DAY. Seriously. I leave for work not 1, not 2, but THREE hours early. Granted, it usually takes me 1.5 hours, but with traffic... you never know. 

I thought everything was fine and dandy until last week my boss' boss calls me in and says that I need proof that my flight was delayed. Cue record scratch and me panicking but saying no problem. This isn't even my boss, it's my boss' boss, who actually holds a higher position as VP of the East Coast as well. 

I'm not sure if this is to mess with me, or my job is in danger, or what, but now I'm in too deep from this idiotic incident to look back. I realize I'm going full-blown Costanza here, but I'm worried about what will happen if I own up to it and the job market is so tough. 

Is it possible to get the flight records of all delayed flights from DTW to NYC on May 5th, 2016? Or can someone from Delta please have pity on this poor soul and just write an email from a delta e-mail that just states that my flight was delayed?

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

You\'re right that to get the extra legroom seats with Delta, you have to buy Comfort+ as a separate class of travel, whereas with United you can buy a regular Economy/Coach ticket and then choose and pay extra for an Economy Plus seat, which sounds like what you want. I think American does something similar with Main Cabin Extra, though I don\'t know how much of their domestic fleet has MCE as something more than just the bulkhead and exit rows. Be wary of American\'s ""preferred"" seats, which are regular seats but towards the front of the plane. No extra legroom or anything with those.\n\nAlaska looks the same as United with ""Premium Class"" seats being economy class tickets that you pay extra to choose those seats.\n\nOne thing you might consider is United offers a ""subscription"" to Economy Plus, where you pay a one time fee ($499 for domestic US excluding Alaska and Hawaii) and that lets you select Economy Plus seating for an entire year. You\'d have to consider if you\'ll fly enough to make it pay off to do this rather than buying Economy Plus each time, and that also means you\'d basically be dedicated to United. https://www.united.com/CMS/en-US/products/travelproducts/Pages/EconomyPlus.aspx\n\nOne thing to watch out for is Basic Economy fares.

Let me get this out of the way first, I made a poor decision in my haste to try and save some money, and should have done things differently. With that out of the way (please don't let me know I should have done it differently, I understand that already), here's my question:

I recently booked a flight through JustFly.com that won't be until May. I'm pretty sure about the dates, but there's a very slim chance that things might happen that would make it not work to travel then. Wanted to book early though to try and get a better deal, since if the things happen they wouldn't be happening till like a week before the scheduled flight at the earliest. So, I did what I thought was smart and bought the ""Extended Cancellation Policy,"" thinking that it would give me flexibility to cancel the flight if something came up.

I misread the policy, and turns out it just means that you can can cancel within 24 hours of *purchase* without paying the extra JustFly fees. I thought it meant I'd be able to cancel up to 24 hours from the flight date.

Delta and AA compete at Raleigh, have found a price they can both live with and that's what the ticket costs.\n\nNot so at Charlotte. If Delta matched AA's pricing, it would be AA laughing their asses off. Who in his right mind would take a flight with a stopover when he could just go directly for about the same price? So now Delta has to undercut AA juuust enough to get the amount of passengers they deem financially profitable. Obviously, Delta won't drop their prices any more than they have to, they're a business and not a charity. So as long as AA doesn't lower their prices, neither will Delta.

First, I can fly with China Eastern/Shanghai Airlines and get a long-ish layover of 13 hours or more in Shanghai, which would be plenty of time to get into town, have lunch and see a couple things.

Second, I can fly Delta/Korean Air and get an 8-hour layover in Honolulu. This doesn't give me as much time, but it would be enough for lunch and perhaps a short walk along the ocean.

Just looking for third party opinions about having a travel card vs an airline card as your main credit card. I'm not really interested in jumping between a bunch of cards based on transaction A vs transaction B. I have the option to upgrade my Chase Sapphire Preferred to a Reserve, and I'm wondering now that I've achieved Mosaic status on JetBlue, if I should keep using my JetBlue Plus card. I just achieved Mosaic status this month because of spend ($50,000). I didn't earn it via flying. But I like having status, given I don't really have status with anything.

So, in your mind, anecdotally and purely based on your gut feelings, Chase Sapphire Reserve + Chase Freedom Unlimited combo (most likely with no status) or continuing using my JetBlue Plus card and maintain my Mosaic status now and forever?","[""Chase UR points open up a lot more travel possibilities than an airline specific card. Most flights, rental cars, some hotels. The points are very valuable. And since you just got status it's the perfect time to grab something new. \n\nQuick comment on upgrading your card: have you had it more than 4 years? if so, it would be better to downgrade the card and apply for a new Chase Sapphire Reserve so you can qualify for the 50k UR welcome bonus (worth $750 when redeemed for travel). (need to downgrade first because of Chase 1 Sapphire rule and gap between Sapphire bonuses was just extended to 4 years). \n\nChase has a whole family of other UR earning cards that work together very nicely. I'd point you in the direction of r/churning for a subreddit all about getting credit cards and traveling for free. \n\nIf you'e spending $50k a year, you could easily be raking in a lot of free trips. (most cards require $5k spend in 3 months). "", 'You don\'t fly, so you want status not for benefits, but only to ""have status""?', ""I fly roughly once a month for work to Las Vegas (from JFK). So, I do fly, but not often enough to achieve a meaningful level of status with someone like Delta. Even with the occasional personal flight (maybe once a quarter, if that), it seems like legacy airline status is out of reach. Generally speaking, you have to fly 30 segments or 25,000 miles. New York to Las Vegas 12 times a year (and that's if I were to fly every month without fail, which isn't the case), wouldn't be enough. Even with the occasional odd trip for pleasure.\n\nThe dilemma is admittedly driven at least in part by a feeling of frustration whenever I fly with colleagues. They've undoubtedly earned their Delta stripes and as a result, get upgraded to first class just about every time we fly together on Delta. I believe they all have Platinum status. I am fully aware of how ridiculous that sounds. I know: Why should I care? But nevertheless, I do, and it’s a factor.\n\nPart of attraction for JetBlue is that it's kind of a class-less airline. Unless you're on a Mint route, everyone's more or less on even an playing field. So, there's less FOMO. I also just like their brand's values. And finally, as a Queens-native, I LOVE that they're a Queens, NY-born airline. There's an intangible X-factor about that which I love.\n\nThat being said, I hear you, DrCalamari. I think our high spending is a big reason why I've been considering the switch. The Reserve's 3X for dining and travel makes it difficult to ignore. Preferred's 2X was tough, but easier to pass on, consider JetBlue Plus also gives 2X on dining (and groceries — which I spend more on per month than travel).""]"

Otherwise she says my only option is to check in online 24 hours in advance and see what seat AA assigns me.\n\nYeah, this is just completely wrong. (Why are you using a travel agent anyway?)\n\nTo be clear, based on what I've seen here, people vastly over-estimate the pervasiveness of Basic Economy. It's not every single economy fare. Regular economy fares exist as well, and the rollout on flights to Europe isn't particularly widespread anyway.\n\nSo, first, confirm whether you are actually booking a basic economy fare; you may not. This would be much easier to do if you were booking the flight yourself, but perhaps you can ask your travel agent what fare class you're in if you insist on going through one.

I bought a nonstop flight on Student Universe MSP-CDG to study aborad. I purchased the ticket as branded Air France but it was a Delta codeshare. Delta operated the flight as AF does not fly directly to MSP in the winter. I knew this going in but saved about $75 buying the AF version of the ticket. Had no issues, could verify my reservation on AF website. 24 hour window opens up and AF directs me to check in on Delta website. Delta tells me I have to check in at the airport. I call them to make sure everything is okay, they assure me its fine. When I get to the airport I can't check in at the normal check in counter,  have to go to the special services desk. The agent is able to verify that I am supposed to be on the flight and that I do indeed have a seat but tells me several times ""I can see the air france reservation, I just cant access it."" I have no idea what this means but she can't give me a boarding pass or check me in. She gets on the phone and furiously tapps on the computer for about 20 minutes. Checking in takes forever but I eventually get checked in and on the flight.  I figure its a Student Universe problem, but this proves to not be true.

My bf bought a United branded and United operated flight ORD-CDG through Student Universe and had absolutly no problems. he was able to check in online, verify his passport information, drop his bag without issue. A friend visits me and has the same exact iteanrry as the bf through Student Universe and also has no problems.

My family makes plans to visit me in France. They get a great deal through KLM's website for MSP-AMS-CDG and back and they are lifelong skymiles members. They bought directly with KLM, on the phone no less. All of their flights were either Delta or AF, they never flew KLM so several of their flights were codeshares within the skyteam alliance as mine was. When they get to the airport they have the same problem as me, the desk agent can view and confirm their reservations, but she can't access them/give them boarding passes/take their bags etc. They go through the same long process as I do, eventually getting on the plane but this time the culprit can't be Student Universe. I even bought a Delta branded Delta operated flight on Student Universe from CDG-MSP to return from study aborad and I had no issues so it seems like the codeshares between the skyteam alliance is the problem here.

I booked everything with Delta, although I think the transatlantic flight is being operated by Virgin Atlantic. 

  13 hours is kinda awkward - it's long but most people I've spoken to think it isn't long enough to warrant leaving the airport to sleep in a hotel, so I'm planning on staying in the airport overnight.

I'll be flying into Buffalo NY from Incheon this August and have to choose between Korean Air or Asiana Airlines (their flight timings and prices are the best so far).


If i were to take Korean Air, i'd be able to book the entire journey from Incheon to Buffalo under KAL, whereas if i were to take Asiana Airlines, i'd have to book a separate domestic flight (JFK to BUF) under Delta.


My flight route for Korean Air would be Incheon => Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson (ATL) => Buffalo, while the Asiana-Delta route will be Incheon => JFK => Buffalo.


I'm leaning more towards Asiana Airlines and Delta because it's cheaper overall and i get to try first class (even though it's on a domestic flight lol) for the first time ever.


The only thing i'm worried about now is whether i'd have a problem moving around JFK because i've heard that check-ins and clearing immigration/customs there take forever, especially since i'm an international student travelling on a visa. It's also my first time into the States so i have no idea how the airports there are like.


I'd have slightly over 4 hours layover in JFK, and my main concern is that 4 hours might be a little tight since i'd have to check-out and check-in again if i take Asiana-Delta. On the other hand, i have a 3 hour layover in ATL if i choose Korean Air. I'm also assuming i do not have to check-out and check-in when i'm in ATL since my flights are all operated by Korean Air (even though the ATL-BUF leg is gonna be on a Delta plane).

Has anyone had experience having to check-out and check-in at JFK from an international flight to a domestic one and how was it? Or would it be better if i just booked Korean Air since all the flights from Incheon to Buffalo will be operated under one airline?


Thanks in advance for reading and taking the time to respond! I appreciate any advice :)

Edit 1: added some info.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for your input! I think it's obvious which option i should take now so i'll be booking my flights soon!","['> If i were to take Korean Air, i\'d be able to book the entire journey from Incheon to Buffalo under KAL\n\nTo be clear, that flight from JFK to BUF would not be a KAL flight, as KAL does not fly to Buffalo. In fact, it may be the same Delta flight on your other itinerary.\n\n> I\'m leaning more towards Asiana Airlines and Delta because it\'s cheaper overall and i get to try first class (even though it\'s on a domestic flight lol) for the first time ever.\n\nDon\'t get your hopes up.

In fact, the transfer would be similar regardless. You\'ll have to pick up your bag at JFK regardless because you\'re coming off an international flight.\n\nIf you take the Asiana flight, you\'d have to take your bag to the Delta counter, whereas if you take the KAL flight, there should be a drop-off after US customs and your bags will be taken off your hands there. KAL is in T1, which pretty much only serves international airlines, so you\'ll be transferring to another terminal on the AirTrain. Asiana is in T4, while Delta domestic flights are in T2.\n\nThe key difference here is that being on a single ticket, you get more protections. If your incoming flight is seriously delayed, or if you get tied up in immigration, you\'ll have a better chance of getting rebooked for free if you book entirely on one ticket.', ""Asiana and Delta are in different terminals at JFK.\n\nThey are not connected behind security.

Delta
ATL 6:09-> MTY(MX) 8:30pm

Aeromexico

I have tried to google maps to see the layout of the airports so I’m half confident. 

Also, would I go through immigration, customs whatever it’s called at MCI or would I have to do it at the Atlanta airport? Or both? 
I only have an hour and I’m afraid I won’t have enough time. 
Oh! I’m also not checking in luggage. I’ll have a carry on and a personal item.  Just to make the process easier since I’ve read that sometimes when you have different airlines you have to re check in the suitcase.

I’ve always been fairly paranoid when it comes to flying. 
Honestly, for anything which is why I leave to the airport extremely early even though I know I could probably check in within an hour or less. 

Should I have concerns for my returning flights?

2. If my BNA -> LAX flight is delayed/canceled (or NRT -> LAX on the return) and I am not able to reach the next flight in time, will the airline(s) still work with me to get me on another flight?

I don't travel much so although I read *some* things in FAQs along with other sties that touch on the subject, I just like to get direct answers to my personal questions as it contains a few more specifics. 

From what I've read, it seems my layover may be a little on the short side considering I'm connecting to an international flight. I'm just worried that I might miss my flight and also not sure if I would have to pick up my checked luggage. 

Here's the situation: 

I am flying Delta and trip was booked on one round trip (Note: all times Eastern).

- I'm supposed to depart from Miami International Airport on a Wednesday at 8:40 AM and arrive at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 10:31 AM.

- There is supposed to be a 1 hour and 13 minute layover in ATL. 

- After the layover, the next leg of the trip is from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 11:44 am to leave for Narita International Airport.

If you have flown via Delta or have experience at ATL, do you think that layover is enough time for me to catch my flight to Japan, especially considering it's an international flight? Do I have to go through customs or another security check?  

I'll ask again at the counter when I get to the airport but does anyone know if I would have to collect my checked luggage from my Miami flight in ATL as both flights are Delta and they were purchased on the same ticket? Or will Delta automatically send my luggage to the next flight? How long does that process usually take? This might actually influence if I decide to take a checked luggage or not.
