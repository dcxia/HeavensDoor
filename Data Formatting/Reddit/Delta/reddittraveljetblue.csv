So a few years ago, like in 2007 or something, I had purchased a round trip ticket from Jet Blue from Long Beach, CA to JFK or LGA (I forgot which it was, but it was NY).  I was scheduled to return to Long Beach on Monday, leaving at 6am in the morning.  At around 11 pm at night, as I am sleeping, I get a phone call.  I finally decide to answer it but it's already gone to voicemail.  Turns out to be a recorded message saying ""due to weather conditions, your Jet Blue flight has been cancelled.  Please check jetblue.com to reschedule your flight"".  So I immediately log on to jetblue and discover that ALL the flights to Long Beach are booked until WEDNESDAY.  So i call them and beg them to get me on a flight because I have to get to work on Monday.  Sorry, they say, we are booked until Wednesday.  What's that?  Oh, sorry we don't partner with other airlines so we can't get you on another flight with anyone else.  What's that? Oh, I'm really sorry, I know it's not raining but it might be tomorrow morning.  What's that?  Oh, don't worry, we will refund you the unused portion of your ticket. 

God I was pissed.  I had to go to Delta to get a flight out at 5pm and got back to Los Angeles at 11 pm and I paid $800, that was the CHEAPEST one way ticket they had for Monday.  Jet Blue refused to re-imburse me for it.  The worst part of it was that Delta is based out of LAX.  So after I got back, I had to hail a cab to drive me to Long Beach to pick up my car at Jet Blue.  They even refused to pay for that!  I was so mad I called them after fuming about it for a few days and they gave me a link and told me to fill out my complaint (or send an email to someone, I forgot, it was a while ago) so I did that and they sent me a $50 gift voucher for a future Jet Blue flight.  Sorry, that's the best we can do sir.  

It was the worst experience I ever had with an airline.","['You are totally in the wrong place. ', ""That's not with this subreddit is about. This subreddit is about that deal a few years ago, when jetBlue let you travel for like a month for one flat fee, so draynen and 77or88 collected donations and traveled around the country visiting other redditors."", ""Jesus, i didn't know i was still subbed to this."", 'To be fair, neither 77or88 or myself collected donations. We were just selected to receive the tickets ; )', 'Sorry, I know.  I realize what this subreddit is about, but because I saw the words Jet Blue it brought out a rage inside that wanted to squash any modicum of positivity associated to that airline, that people might feel.  I mean people might think, hey, wow, good on Jet Blue.  If such a thought ever formed in my presence, I want to be sure and destroy it.', 'Tell me about it.', 'Woah, me too. Do you still live in Seattle?', 'I actually moved to LA for 2 years. Just got back to Seattle a couple months ago.']"
