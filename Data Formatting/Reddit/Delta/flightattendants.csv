I just applied to the Delta announcement that came out a couple of days ago. I did some research and saw that Atlanta and Salt Lake City are flight attendant bases. In your experience, what‚Äôs the chance of a new flight attendant getting assigned to either of those bases once they are done training?

I‚Äôm getting married a year from now in Costa Rica, and was really wondering if she could get my flight there for free but was thinking that if I am on standby this may not be a super reliable travel experience to one of the most important events of my life! Haha. Any information is appreciated :)","['I cannot emphasize this enough, do NOT try to fly standby if you need to be somewhere on a certain day. If your schedule is flexible, standby is fine because who cares if you get left behind. But if you need to be somewhere by a certain date, I recommend buying a one way ticket far in advance and then flying standby to go home. Your sister will have no seniority in a year and idk how Delta works but most airlines award standby seats by seniority. Buy tickets for the wedding and use standby for the honeymoon. Weddings are stressful enough.', 'Your parents will get to be on her full flight benefits and she is allowed to have one additional companion. If she‚Äôs married, that would usually go to her spouse. But she will get to decide who is listed as her companion. That person will fly at the same priority she will. She will also get a few buddy passes a year, but they cost money and are not a great perk as they fly at the lowest priority on the standby list. \n\nSo basically, if she chooses you as her one companion (she can change who the companion is once a year) then yes, you will be able to fly standby with her. Your parents will get to fly standby with her regardless of who she chooses. But for your wedding, I would not bank on a standby ticket! Maybe for the return flight if you‚Äôre able to be flexible!', 'Siblings are not included as pass riders (those who fly standby for free). As someone else said your sister, your parents, and if she‚Äôs married a spouse. If she isn‚Äôt married she can have one travel companion. That could be you, a friend, another family member etc. The buddy passes are absolutely not worth the stress they bring because you‚Äôre still paying - but also still not guaranteed. \n\nSo to answer your question in short - unless she makes you her travel companion, no, you will not receive flight benefits. \n\nSource: I work for Delta', 'Congrats to your sister! It‚Äôs the best job in the world! I could be wrong, but I heard Delta‚Äôs non reving (traveling on passes) is based on seniority..... which absolutely sucks since your sister just got hired and she will be at the bottom of the list for all the non reving. It all also depends on the load of the date you‚Äôre trying to go, BUT for your wedding day, I personally WOULDNT risk it. Good luck!', 'Dang it, so I can‚Äôt start traveling the world for free?! Lol üòú \nIt doesn‚Äôt sound like I have a good chance of being able to go anywhere easily, unfortunately.', 'She‚Äôs not married, she isn‚Äôt dating anyone so I actually think she would consider choosing me to be a travel companion. What does that mean?', 'Hi! Do you know what other airlines‚Äô non-reving system is NOT based on seniority?', 'I work there and I can say that if you are smart, even with low seniority, you can get to most places at some point. I have been to multiple destinations globally. The absolute hardest place to get to are Lagos Nigeria but you can certainly get to Austrailia, London, Paris, Rome, etc. if you are smart and plan.', 'You do, especially in October and November, when flying slows down before the holidays. But yeah, standby sucks ass üòÖ', 'If she chooses you as your travel companion then you‚Äôll receive standby flight benefits. If she doesn‚Äôt, you get nothing.', 'American Airlines non reving is based on the time of check in within your priority group.', 'Same for JetBlue.']"

20,FA regional or mainline,4,d2twav,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/d2twav/fa_regional_or_mainline/,8,1568252330.0,"My monthly expenses aren't much. I traveled in my car for about 2 years, so i never had rent, and currently don't pay rent where i'm at. I only pay for my car insurance($58), phone bill($60), and food. I'm not sure yet if i would want to turn this into a career.  

Would regional be enough for extra expenses to travel on my own (hotels, food on the job), and saving up?

Also, would anyone in regional mind sharing a rough estimate about monthly pay they've received?

I've also been seeing that FA for regional seem to be able to use their flight benefits more than those working for mainline. 

Would anyone have a thought about whether regional might be better for me or mainline? I'm open to working mainline, because of the pay, but if i'm not sure if i'll be long-term, would regional be better to use flight benefits?","['There are mainlines with no minimums or maximums, I can‚Äôt imagine working for a regional over a mainline. The money and the lifestyle of mainline is just so much more beneficial', ""WIthout saying who I work for, my regional starting pay works out to about $18-$22k a year. I get paid twice a month, and the first check is about $500-$600 after tax, and the second is the same if I don't fly, and if I do, with per diem, can be upwards of $1,000. So figure about $1500 take home a month. Now, on the road I spend a fortune on food and sodas and junk. \n\nOn my days off, i LOOOOVVVEE my flight benefits. I have been all over the world. What you do is you have three choices for your days off, like let's say, Amsterdam, Tokyo, and Paris. You watch the night before your days off to see which has the best loads (most available seats) and it's then a crap shoot about getting on. In general, I get the best seat on the plane because I plan smart. Then, once I am on the plane and in the sky, I connect to the wifi and book my hotel because you NEVER EVER want to book your hotel in advance because the plane could cancel, delay, or you could get bumped by a senior staffer. \n\nThere are 'slow times' for all places worldwide geographically and so you are limited to when and where you can go. For example, the best time to go to Sydney, Australia is now through December 15th. Loads are lighter now because the weather isn't ideal yet. \n\nAt a regional, the pros are you can usually pay someone to take your shifts. Cons are the pay is not great. My management team is amazing, and the company I work for on the whole, is great. (I think my experience is probably different than most others though). \n\nRegionals often open/close/merge/bankrupt because companies get tax breaks when they buy and sell and merge regionals. This can be frustrating if you are building longevity. Also at many regionals there is a pay ceiling. \n\nWith mainline, you get great pay and more days off which means more time . to go on vacations. Downside is you are on reserve forever."", ""I wouldn't plan on long-term, and want to do some studying for life coaching. \n\nIf I worked mainline, I'd have more money, but would I have enough time to study, or would regional be better for that?"", 'Mainline for sure. \nIdk why it‚Äôs assumed mainline doesn‚Äôt get time off... I actually work very little on my days on call and pick up on my scheduled days off to go over my guarantee. I‚Äôm low seniority and make great money.

Why waste all that time at a small carrier when you can be out the gate making that. \nI‚Äôve never had an issue getting anywhere with our benefits either. We have multiple extra jump seats.', ""Regional would be better for the coverage of flight benefits, but it can be a blessing and a curse. If you work for, say skywest, and you want to get on a skywest plane operating as Delta, then you would have priority over Delta crew. If you wanted to fly on a delta mainline plane or other delta regional, then you're below all the delta crew listing standby and regionals operating. Having flight benefits on multiple airlines would be beneficial if you had young children, married, or people to travel alongside. As a mainline FA, you can still fly on other airlines as most have a mutual cabin seat agreement. I'm with a mainline carrier and I've flown on other airlines for free, but this is just for you.

I've only applied to mainlines that have unions... But I'm starting to wonder about Delta and how their whole non-union system works and the pros and cons of having one vs. not having one.,"['Absolutely.  Employees in this industry aren‚Äôt governed by the same labor laws as the majority of the rest of the population.  Our labor laws were written nearly 100 years ago and have had few updates since.  My union is the only one looking out for me.', ""I like the job security of having a Union. There's specific procedures and rules the company has to follow to fire me. And since we are so replaceable I don't have to live in fear of being fired if I get sick or speak up about something. They also help us all negotiate better pay and work rules. The cons are you have to pay dues (ours are 50$ a month) and not everyone agrees on everything because its all a bunch of different people. Also there are good union reps and terrible ones but I think that's any job people have to do. I wouldn't do this job without  a union. It just feels too uncertain to me."", 'I would say it seems like Delta does a decent job taking care of their employees from what I can tell. But I don‚Äôt work there and would say that it would be hard to really tell the difference without having worked at both Delta and another mainline. \n\nI do know a lot of the things that Delta have said against unions are totally false. One thing they put out is about not having a relationship with management. Well I would imagine no airline has enough management to cover all of us and be close like other jobs do and they shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve had good conversations with managers at my airline and feel like I can go to them; I was even sent a gift when I was in the ER so to me that‚Äôs an absolutely false point. \n\nBut yeah maybe they take good care of their employees but the false anti material they put out there makes you wonder why they push so hard against having a union. Their pilots got one and not trying to generalize but the political side most pilots seem to fall on is very anti-union but it seems a majority of pilots have good solidarity in their unions. Anyway, I think if you are applying to airlines and Delta wants to hire you, you should take it as it is hard to get your foot in the door at any airline! Best of luck!', ""Anybody that's unionized will tell you that it's required or necessary but I'm not so sure. Union's only have power of their employees have some sort of power when they are together problem is even a few unionized the company still holds most of the cards. The type of job you have can change whether or not you have the power or they have the power. With flight attendants unfortunately or easy to replace for the most part because barrier for entry is so low and so many people want to do the job. On the other hand with pilots and barriers entry is very high and it's also hard to get new people doing the job That's where the true power comes from.\n\nDoes that mean you should or should not unionized I don't know what I do know is that people think it's a cure all and it definitely is not."", 'This^ also I think it‚Äôs important to have an official outlet to voice your concerns for guidance because sometimes companies have less empathetic viewpoints. ie conflict with a fly partner, you don‚Äôt want to get management involved because ultimately you don‚Äôt want to put anyone‚Äôs job in danger. Also in irregular operations you want a layover of protection from getting screwed.

Also, how do you trade/drop/pick up trips? I understand that there is a system called Open Time, but what is it like? How do I signal that I want to drop my A days, for instance? I know I won't be able to drop them at first when I have no seniority, but how do I even go about trying? Is there any harm to listing them as something I want to drop? I'm thinking if no one picks them up, I just work them, which I would have had to do anyway, right? Is there a downside to listing them as something someone else could pick up if they want?

Would anyone be willing to post screenshots of the systems Delta uses for bidding and swapping? With personal information blocked out, of course.

Thanks!!","['[deleted]', 'Usually they let you know your assignment the day before your Adays start but they don‚Äôt always do that. What I do if they haven‚Äôt given me an assignment for the next day yet is go to bed early and set an alarm for early in the morning between like 6-8am, I also make sure my phone is right by me and I keep it on loud just in case they do cal in the middle of the night. Adays can definitely be your best friend when you‚Äôre junior and want international trips,  you could even swap your assigned trips that you have for the month for Adays. Not a lot of flight attendants like Adays so it‚Äôs easier to swap assigned trips that are on your line for Adays.  Another thing you could do to try to get international trips besides just picking them up or trying to get them on Adays would be to try to swap a one or two day domestic trip for international. There‚Äôs some flight attendants who like to do that because they see it as a win because they‚Äôre going to end up working less days if they trade an international for your 1 or 2 days trip. ', 'Just a minor heads up: they will glaze over bidding once you pass your final test. You will be tired and it‚Äôs all jargon. Then you won‚Äôt hear about it again until your second new hire meeting. It‚Äôll be a mystery for a short period. \nJust go with the flow. \nFocus on making a great impression and acing training!', 'Depending on the base you end up getting and which base you actually want to end up at, it can take years for you to be able to get the trips you want on a regular basis and not necessarily just a few years. I‚Äôm 1.5 years in with delta. If you want to drop trips or trade with flight attendants there‚Äôs a drop/swap board that you post the trip on. If you‚Äôre trips aren‚Äôt great (and they probably won‚Äôt be) then the chances of a flight attendant just picking it up or swapping for a better trip isn‚Äôt likely. Dropping your Adays is also pretty difficult because most flight attendants don‚Äôt like Adays. If you want international trips, then as a junior flight attendant your best bet is to preference international trips and international standby on your Adays or to just pick up international trips. Preferencing is pretty much putting in what you would like to get as trips while on your Adays but does not mean you will get it because preferences are ran in seniority order. Depending on the base you get you won‚Äôt have weekends off for a while. I could probably count on one hand the amount of weekends I‚Äôve had off since I started working. The most senior base is Atlanta. A more junior base is Boston, it‚Äôs easier to get international trips as a junior flight attendant when you are based in Boston than in Atlanta but there are more international places to fly to out of Atl than Bos. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. You can also do out of base pick ups to get international trips. During training they will briefly go over schedules and bidding. Posting screenshots is not allowed so I can‚Äôt do that but if you want a more in depth explanation I can try to do that for you. I hope this helps. Also I‚Äôm sorry if there‚Äôs any typos or other errors in this message, it‚Äôs pretty late at night where I‚Äôm at. ', 'They use a PBS variant.  If its anything like ours, you hold what you hold, then try and trade based on what the computer will let you do.  Which is of course all based on seniority.  So get in good with those senior mamas so you can pick up the three trips the drop each month.\n\n&#x200B;', 'Remember that the definition of a ‚Äúgood trip‚Äù or a ‚Äúbad trip‚Äù is very subjective to an extent. Some people need to commute in the day of, so a later report is ideal. Some people prefer long layovers, regardless of what the legs actually look like. It really depends on your preferences. \nI‚Äôm one year and hold some layovers I ask for (once 3x in one month!). Have yet to hold a day off that I want... but that‚Äôs where swapping comes into play. \nOpen time is basically first come, first serve. There are trips with an open position available to pickup. You can get really creative with it! Many of us use Facebook to faster communicate the need for a swap, and thus trade with each other. \nAdays are a toss up. They can go swimmingly, and you may even go unused! Or they short call the hell out of you and you gotta rush. It all comes with the territory. \nGood luck!', 'It is not the same system. ', 'That is strange to hear because there are videos on YouTube showing the Delta pilot bid system, some even seem to be posted by official Delta work groups', 'Thanks!', 'This is what I feel like is going to happen. Once I am in training obviously I will need to focus on learning what I need to know to do my job. So right now, I might as well take the time to learn the system that will determine how enjoyable and lucrative my job will be to me.\n\nI found this manual online. Is NAVBLUE the system Delta uses?\n\n[http://www.pbshelp.info/delta/Web%20App%20Bidder%20Guide.pdf](http://www.pbshelp.info/delta/Web%20App%20Bidder%20Guide.pdf)', ""Thanks so much, this really clarifies a lot! I'm finally starting to understand, from your answer and from some YouTube videos I've seen, that A days might actually be my best friends as far as getting international trips and other high time trips. I'm just scared of being super low on sleep, since they can call you at literally any time. How do you manage that? It seems like there would be no good time to go to sleep if they can call you at any time from midnight to midnight for 3 days in a row. Like, say you had a day off, followed by three A days. Would it make sense to take a sleeping pill around 4pm on your day off, so you could sleep 4 to midnight and then be rested if they call you right away? But then, if they don't call you right away, you could be up all night and then be crashing the next day when they finally do call you. It seems like a no-win situation."", 'Can you explain a little more? What is PBS? I am new to the airline industry, so I don\'t know all the technical terms. When you say, ""you hold what you hold"" I get that you are talking about trips that you are scheduled for, but I don\'t get exactly how you get scheduled for those trips. That is the bidding part, right?\n\nAs for the swapping part, I thought that was by computer, too. Like I thought you just posted somewhere that you have a trip on a certain date, all the details, and then I guess I don\'t know what happens next. Does it go to the first person who sees it, wants it and claims it? Or do people have a certain amount of time to bid for it and then the computer gives it to the most senior person who bid for it? But it sounds like you are saying that senior FAs can give their trips away to anyone they like. So, like if a senior FA at your base likes you, she might just ask you if you want the trip and then you could have it, even if someone more senior wants it, too?', ""Right, that's what I was thinking, that some people would want one thing and some would want another, so as long as I know what I want and how to bid/swap for it, then I'd be ahead of the game. Again, fully understanding that seniority is everything and that anyone more senior than me would beat me if they bid for the same things. But, for instance, it seems like weekends off are really popular, but that doesn't matter to me at all, so I wouldn't be competing for that.\n\nI get that they will go over this in training, but the way it is often described as being so complicated, I wanted to get a jump start on figuring it out."", 'No problem! If you have any other questions feel free to ask me. ', 'Basically everything is based on seniority. Everything. As a junior, you‚Äôre going to fly what you hold, unless the computer lets you trade your trips with open time. As far as trading with other attendants, that‚Äôs fair game, but nobody is going to want your trips. \n']"

I'm definitely applying for other airlines and keeping an eye out for when Delta and United start hiring (for more than just a bilingual position). I have no experience as a flight attendant, and find myself wondering if I could get experience with another airline - would that make me more desirable as an applicant? Since Mesa airlines have a partnership with American and United is there a possibility of that being a good step in the door?

Or would it maybe be better to go another route by applying for a different Job with American? Getting my name and work ethic out there and known within the company, and so when there's later on a chance to apply for my desired job they know who I am, and I am doing so internally.

92,My SO works as a flight attendant for Skywest and has transferred her domicile from Chicago to Atlanta and I have a few questions.,3,cqhp0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/cqhp0p/my_so_works_as_a_flight_attendant_for_skywest_and/,6,1565853807.0,"Hi all,

A bit of background. We both used to live in SF and I got a really good job opportunity to Atlanta and moved here late last year. She had always wanted to be a flight attendant so I encouraged her to start applying here in Atlanta (since it's a giant hub) and she got a job with Skywest in March. 

They based her out of Chicago after training and has been putting in domicile transfer requests every month and got it granted this month. Obviously we're both delighted to be living together again soon but I've been researching on what her quality of work will be like. 

While in Chicago, she had a whole lot more work (for United and Delta) and multi-day trips and was kept fairly busy. I looked at the Atlanta destinations (strictly Delta flights) and they seem much more limited and I'm worried that although she's going to be with me, that she won't enjoy her work as much or get paid as much as she did while based in ORD. I've also noticed the number of flight attendants here is much lower than ORD.

So my questions for anyone with experience flying for Skywest in Atlanta are:

- What is it like working out of Atlanta?
- Is it just lots of single day trips or are there multi-day trips?
- Is there free parking at the airport for flight attendants?

Thanks for bearing with me.

Good day.","['Just because she‚Äôs based in ATL doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean her flying will be based out of ATL.  She will always start and end her trip there, but the days between she could be anywhere.', ""I don't know much about Skywest but I will say they may not have a base in Atlanta much longer. Endeavor is always hiring and they have a big presence in Atlanta though I think Skywest has a better work life.\n\nI say she applies to Delta when they open hiring soon (don't know when but it's always around this time)."", 'I have a friend who is based in ATL and I‚Äôm based in ORD. I would say there is a difference in the aircraft flying as they only fly the smaller CRJ 200 planes( this is where you work alone) . As long as she keeps herself on first call she‚Äôll more than likely be working on her reserve days. It may also take her a longer time to get a line since it definitely is a way smaller base.', ""Thanks for the response. I figured as much but looking at skywest destinations from Atlanta, it looks like they operate to airports that only have Atlanta as their destination. So I'm just concerned she'll be flying back and forth between Atlanta and those cities."", 'I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it.  Regional flying can shift a lot and can vary seasonally.  Plus what you don‚Äôt see on that route map are flights operated by Delta that she could deadhead on to get to her next flight.

Help Please!,0,8xgbye,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/8xgbye/applying_as_a_flight_attendant_for_delta_vs/,13,1531199711.0,"Hey guys! I am looking to apply as a flight attendant for either Delta, American, or United. I'm trying to figure out which airline would be the best for me to work for, and wondered what the differences are between the three that I should be most aware of, especially as a newbie FA. I would greatly appreciate your expertise and advice as professionals in the field. :)

My plan was to apply for these companies in the fall when (I thought...) the three applications would all open at around the same time, but United just opened, so I have slightly less time than I thought to mull this all over. 

Questions I have:

1. Differences between Delta, American, and United I should consider in choosing? (Salaries, Unions, Scheduling, Time off, etc and more I wouldn't think of yet)
2. Benefits of Unionizing vs not (as I know Delta is not unionized)
3. Which airline would it be easiest to get a base out of California with? (I am definitely willing to move, but if I can be based in CA with easier access to friends and family that would be the dream.) 
4. I am a German major, and have fairly high conversational German, though I hesitate to call myself fluent- Is it worth trying to apply as Language of Destination/Bilingual? Can I apply to both bilingual and normal positions, or do I only get one application per airline?
5. (United Specific) The application for United that just opened is showing for Chicago- would it be basically guaranteed I would be placed in Chicago (initially at least)? 
6. Odds of starting out with international flights rather than domestic? (I am an International Studies major and dying to get back out into the world again:) 
7. Anything I should do to bolster my application/resume? 
   1. I have so far: Double degree in International Studies and German, a year and a half experience living in Europe with a lot of travel experience, German and Spanish Intermediate/Advanced language skills, working as a waitress now to get more customer service experience, and I am about to take an adult and pediatric CPR/AED/First Aid class.

Thank you so much to anyone who has taken the time to read this and answer any questions!! 

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who answered my questions! You guys have been so helpful. ","['So much to answer.  I can speak for first hand for Delta and United.  \nThe companies offer similar products. Benefits and what not.  \nIf you are looking to stay in California the airline you would most likely to get that would be United.  \nAlthough Delta doesn\'t have a union at this point the employees are pushing hard to get one.  I am guessing only a matter of time before they have one.  I\'ve talked to many friends that agree with it and it could be debated for many hours but in my belief it will happen.  Sad but true.  \nMy experience with Union vs non is just clear cut. More protections with a union.  If you do end up in trouble there ""should"" be someone fighting for you. \n\nLanguage bases are challenging. I would recommend not using it and here is why.  The only language that has a large presence in different places would be spanish.  With German. You will only fly to Germany.... That\'s it.  Granted there are different places to go within Germany buttttt you most likely will have to make a one year commitment to the German base which means you only fly to Germany.  3-5 trips a month. Going to the same place and not having really any options to go anywhere else would be your hurdle.  Again just summing up what my friends in speaker bases have said. That also being said with a German speaker I think most are based on the East coast.  So factor that into your choices.  \nJust because they are hiring for Chicago doesn\'t mean you will get to Chicago.  With the merge finally happening in October I\'m sure they will be opening all bases and allowing people to move.  So even if it says that it isn\'t a guarantee and I know SFO is ALWAYS open. \nDepends on the carrier you select and where you are based. If you want international flying with Delta you need to be based in JFK. For United it would be Newerk or Dullas. \nNothing to be done about your resume.  Smile.  Friendly.  Problem solve.  \nCPR the way the company wants you to  do it will taught to you in training so having the extra training may confuse you.  I used to be an EMT before this career and we were trained to just do compressions no breathing unless you have a bag valve mask.... Which most airlines carry but can only be released to a medical professionals and being in an emergency time is precious.... So to now learn I have to use a pocket mask with breathing is what my procedures are could throw you off. Not sure of what skill level you have but it never hurts to know and have extra training.  \n\nI can talk to you a bit about the reserve system for United and Delta if you want to PM me. Along with insurance and other things specifically about United if you want.  I hope it helps.  Let me know if you need anything.  ', 'I will touch on the union vs non-union carriers.   I‚Äôve been a FA for Alaska Airlines for just under 20 years and can say I would not like flying for an airline without a union.  I know it can be a controversial topic but for me the bottom line comes down to having a guaranteed contract that can not be changed or ignored.   Having a union doesn‚Äôt prevent delays, irregular operations or bad days, but it does make certain there are provisions in place when crazy things happen.   Some feel the monthly dues are not worth it but I feel like it‚Äôs kind of like an insurance policy.   In this day & age where everyone has a smartphone with camera, it helps to have someone in your corner should you be accused of rude customer service or even a safety issue.   \n\nMy union has a good relationship with management and our contracts are generally well done.   If you have specific questions please feel free to reach out!   Good luck! ', ""Honestly I would apply to all of them and ask these questions when you get to your face to face interviews.  If nothing else you'll get a feel for the culture and be better able to make a decision."", 'I think the 3 major U.S. airlines offer pretty similar products. I love having a union at my airline, but we also still have to fight an awful lot.\n\nI can‚Äôt speak much for United or Delta, but the only AA bases that fly to Germany are Dallas, Charlotte and Philadelphia, so if you pass the language qualification exam, one of those will be your base. You probably won‚Äôt be able to hold a German line every month for some years, but it could happen. \n \nAs for Californian bases, we have LA and San Francisco. SF is a domestic base. I hear LA is a great base, but the transfer list is loooooooong.\n\nThere‚Äôs still a lot going on at AA with the merger, but I think it‚Äôs all going fairly well. Both sides of the merger are coming under one contract soon. To my understanding, there are multiple contracts at United due to their several mergers, and it‚Äôs been that way for years. \n\nI‚Äôll also put in my two cents about reserve: It sucks. At United, you‚Äôd be straight reserve until you‚Äôre senior enough to hold a line. At American, you‚Äôll be straight reserve for a year. After your  first year, you‚Äôll switch to a monthly rotating system for 4 years- one month on reserve, the next on a line. After that, it will be 1 month of reserve to 3 line months until you can hold off reserve. Delta has A-days, so a handful of days a month, every month, that you‚Äôre on call. Seems pretty sweet to me. ', 'I got to read this just before going in to work, and it was such a huge relief to have so many questions answered! Thank you so much for taking the time to answer everything, I will definitely PM you with more questions. :) ', 'Also, seeing as I was totally panicking for a moment there (I thought I had about another month-two months before applications started opening to get these questions answered).... very relevant username! :D', ""Thank you so much for your reply! I personally am strongly leaning towards unionized airlines, because of all the reasons you outlined. If you don't mind me asking, approximately how much are the monthly dues? Like $25 a month or more like $50-$100? Or is it a sliding scale...? (I know the answer may vary depending on the union but I am big on budgeting so I like to know ballparks in advance at least.\n\nThank you again, I know it is a touchy subject so I very much appreciate your reply! "", ""I definitely plan on doing exactly that! I mostly made this post because United's applications opened up much sooner than I expected and I got worried about applying for United and potentially getting in before I had the chance to find out more about Delta or American. \n\nThanks for the reply!

No need to panic. Even if they do give you the CJO they aren't looking until the fall to start so you would still have time. "", 'You are most welcome!   Alaska is part of AFA (Association of Flight Attendants) which United is as well.  Our dues are $50 monthly and are the same for all AFA carriers.   You don‚Äôt pay any dues during your probation period & then you can choose to pay directly from your paycheck each month.  Most FAs pay this way!   American has their own union so I‚Äôm not positive what their dues are but I would imagine it‚Äôs similar.   ', ""I think you have more time than you're anticipating... The selection process can take weeks or months just depending on when you apply and how quickly the airline is moving.  I think all three are pretty similar but with Delta in particular you aren't unionized which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your outlook.

Or would I be responsible for that? Also, what's the whole interviewing process like? If i pass this interview, what should I expect next?

Any tips or information anyone has would be greatly appreciated!","['Yes, Delta will fly you to Atlanta. The process of hiring starts at application, assessment test, Virtual interview, phone interview, assessment test, face to face interview.

The in person interview was 5 hours long and was different than any other interview I‚Äôve done. They want the best of the best so you have to make sure you‚Äôre prepared for it.

And sorry for the wall of text, but if you can give me any advice, it's appreciated. You don't even have to answer every question, just give input where you can. 

So the questions, 

1. What companies do you recomend applying to? Are there any companies you would stay away from? 

2. What was training like for you? How long was it, and how rigorous did you find it to be?

3. What is your schedule like, and how was your schedule when you where brand new? I know seniority plays a big role. 

4. Do you commute? Do you commute across cities, or across whole states? How does that work?

5. What is the best part of the job, vs worst? 

6. How much money were you making when you first started? (if you feel comfortable sharing. I know some companies have a NDA on that) 

7. An lastly, what advice would you give me? I dont want this to just be a job I want to turn it into a real career, and stick in it for the long run. 
","['K on mobile so if I miss something, just @ me back. \n\n1. Best company is subjective. Look at their bases. Culture. Which airlines do you like flying? What‚Äôs closest to your home so you can avoid commuting? What‚Äôs their contract like? Most airlines have their contracts online on their union website. Also, union or no union? Would you rather go with a regional where you‚Äôll gain seniority quick but make less or mainline where it‚Äôs the opposite?\n\n2. I worked for a regional and now mainline. Regional training was tough as boots. Mainline training was dumb, but that was supposedly a revamped curriculum that they threw out to the trash and revamped again. Expect it to be very draining. \n\n3. Pay depends on the company. If the contract is available online, you can have a good idea of how much you‚Äôll make. \n\n4. Never really commuted. Though nowadays I live on the opposite coast of where I‚Äôm from, so I make that commute once or twice a month. It would kill me to do that full time. Commuting is stressful and a job in itself so, once again, please see point one. \n\n5. Schedule depends on company, but also bases. Some bases only do domestic flights, short hauls, some do more cross country, international, etc. \n\n6. Save, save, save your money. No matter where you end up, you‚Äôll be pretty poor for a while. ', 'Ok. I will try and break it down.\n\nCompanies like JetBlue, Spirit, and Southwest, you will get paid pretty good money, but you are limited to where you can travel to. (I will explain later). \n\nCompanies like United, Delta, and American (""Mainline"" Airlines) travel all over the world, so if you work for them, your standby rank is above Southwest, Spirit, and JetBlue. This is important if you wish to travel to Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, or anywhere on the globe these places fly. If you want to travel, the Big Three are where it\'s at. United has a Union, so it\'s hard to be fired. Delta has no union, so one bad complaint letter and you are fired. The pay is descent too, but hard in New York or LA, where rents are nuts. \n\n""Regional"" Contract Airlines only fly within the USA, Canada, and Caribbean only. Delta has several they contract with, like SkyWest and Endeavor. They actually own Endeavor Air so the flight benefits at Endeavor are shared with mainline Delta f/a\'s. Regional airlines are small planes, and the pay for almost all regionals is about $18/flight hour, or about $9/real hour. Mainline is anywhere from $24-$30/flight hour.\n\nNow, let\'s discuss \'flight hour\' and \'real hour\'. \n\nA flight hour is you being paid only when the door closes and the plane is moving. You do NOT get paid when you are working for boarding, hanging coats, serving drinks. You only get paid when the plane moves. So you have to be at the plane an hour before, and if your flight time is only 45 minutes long, you are only getting paid 45 minutes even though you are working for about 2 hours. So, that money is sort of divided over the whole time, which is why a $19/flight hour is really like $10 for example. \n\nNow, the other thing to consider, is average length of the trip. For example, if you are at a regional, you could theoretically work 4 trips back and forth to Syracuse from NYC (called 2 turns). Each one is 30 minutes of flight time, but if you factor in the deplane, and boarding time, it\'s about 7 hours of your day, for about 2 total hours flight time pay. This is worst case. Now, at mainline, you could (best case) get a long-haul flight to Paris from New York. You might get ten hours flight time each way, so a round trip work day could be 1 hour boarding, 10 hours flight, 15 min deplane, 45 min board, 10 hours flight, and 15 min deplane. So you are working 22 hours with 20 of it being in flight hours. You make crazy amounts of money then. So, average flight time of each trip, has a big impact of your money. You want to work longer flights than shorter ones.\n\nBest part of the job is being able to wake up and decide to go to vegas or miami on my day off at a moment\'s notice. \n\nWorst part of the job is certain destinations have awful passengers going there, who lie, complain, make up stories to get into first class, and are huge pains in the butt. Any one of them can get you fired if they complain loud enough, and it\'s your job to keep them in check and keep them from writing a complaint letter.\n\nIt\'s honestly not a great career, and I would tell you to go be a pilot. The reason it\'s not a career is that if you ask ANY former F/A who is older and either quit or was fired, you have zero marketable skills. The CPR is not certified by the AHA or Red Cross. You have a resume of basically the equivalent of \'customer service\', or \'bartender of the sky\' or \'safety officer\', all of which pay shit in the real world (well maybe bartending pays more). So if you did it for 10 years and didn\'t travel around the globe on your days off, and then quit, you would not be able to get a job anywhere and it would be kind of a waste. That\'s why almost everyone does it for a few years, travels the world, and either quits and goes back to 9-5 or for a select few, become lifers. It\'s a very addictive easy job. Addictive, easy. \n\nAfter 5 years, your life expectancy shortens. Your likelyhood of cancer is 5x more than other jobs. Your skin looks like crap. You don\'t sleep and it ages you. \n\nNot trying to scare you because I love the job, but besides traveling for fun, you are not building a resume of usable skills.', ""This is amazing!

I'm not sure if you're aware but they are technically split into several different companies (Norwegian long haul, soon Argentina, and then EU DY)\n\nI know the ones flying out of LGW get some discounts on DY flights in Europe as well as Long Haul. But since Norwegian isn't flying domestic in the US I would suspect you only get benefits on the long haul flights to the EU and maybe DY flights in Europe.\n\nIf you need to travel around the US I would suggest sticking with Delta.

I utilized hostels and couchsurfing when I started to help make it cheaper. There were definitely shitty days, but there was a lot of good days as well. In the end it all evened out.

It saves tons of money and I bring enough variety not to get sick of what I eat throughout the trip.

157,Attention Flight Attendants! I have some questions.....,3,b72r03,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/b72r03/attention_flight_attendants_i_have_some_questions/,4,1553922583.0,"Hello all,

I'm just here to ask some questions regarding the position. My sibling is currently a Skywest Flight Attendant. They seem to love the position right now, I'm trying to convince them to make the move to working for a domestic airline like: United, Delta or American. Is there anything any advice you could give me in order to help me sway them to finally make the move? How's your experience with the airline you currently work for? Do you have a ""line"" yet or are you still on reserve? If you're on reserve, are you getting past your monthly minimum or no? My sibling currently does not hold a ""line"" at the moment, so that's why I'm trying to convince them to make the move now before they get used to living a life with a line. Thanks for the helpful tips and advice that you send me! ","['[deleted]', ""I work for a regional airline like SkyWest as well. We are sort of a competitor, sort of. Anyway, at my job, it takes about a year to be a line holder at my base. Other bases are different. Once you have a line, and depending on the availability, you can _potentially_ drop a good amount of your flying, keep your benefits, and make more elsewhere, like uber or waiting tables in a big airport. Working for a 'mainline' airline is great because you get almost triple the pay because the flights are longer. Instead of $18/flight hour, for 3 flight hours in a 12 hour day, you will now get $24/flight hour, for 8 hours in a 12 hour day. So it is way more money. Plus, you get to travel abroad which is amazing. \n\nMany senior people at regionals drop all their shifts, work the minimums to keep benefits, and work elsewhere. Non-senior work extra, upwards of 120 flight hours a month, never see their beds, and save every penny. Greenhorn workers are on reserve, and get a guarantee usually of 75 flight hours whether they fly or not. \n\nRemember, as far as health, after 5 years, you have a decrease in life expectancy, as well as an increase in the likelyhood of cancer. At a regional, many experience hearing loss over time, as well as other health issues from the constant up and down and up and down in a day, as opposed to mainline. \n\nAll in all, I think it really depends why you got into it. For me, I travel the world on my days off. It wouldn't matter who I worked for as long as I can bid my days together (i.e. 7 consecutive days off) and go to Egypt."", 'My sibling ultimately wants to travel internationally. ', 'JESUS this sounds scary!!!', 'They can use their benefits to travel which IMO is better than working it. I prefer working domestic trips over international for the most part. Even if you are a mainline employee, international trips will go to senior flight attendants anyway. Though sometimes you may be able to pick them up on your days off, which some people dedicate hours to searching for these. ']"

So like the title says, I have a few questions about the above topics that I‚Äôd like to get some feedback on. 

1.) I‚Äôm bilingual in English and Vietnamese. Last I saw on Delta‚Äôs page, Vietnamese wasn‚Äôt one of the LOD choices. Does anyone know why that is? I was disappointed, but just assumed it was because it‚Äôs not as popular/high demand as the other languages? Idk. I mean, I‚Äôd still mention it in my app when I apply, or course, but was curious.

2.) I wear glasses and am practically blind without ‚Äòem. Never worn contacts before. Should I stick with my glasses for the interviews (video and F2F) or should I ditch ‚Äòem and try contacts? I‚Äôve always been curious about this one and have never heard or read anyone‚Äôs thoughts on it, so I gotta ask... does it matter? I‚Äôd like to think not so much and that most airlines wouldn‚Äôt be too strict on this, but I wonder if anyone can chime in and tell me what they‚Äôve experienced‚Äìwhether you were the one wearing glasses or saw others at the F2F wearing glasses. I‚Äôve seen a bunch of FAs (on YT) wear glasses when working, but what about before you become a FA?

3.) So rn I have a bob hairstyle. It‚Äôs fine if I keep it down and not tie it up for the interviews/F2F, right? Same dilema with the glasses bc I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal and as long as I look neat, well put together, and presentable, I think I‚Äôll be fine, but wanted to hear your guys‚Äô anecdotes about this one, too. I‚Äôve also seen FA YouTubers sport all types of hairstyles, but is there a preferred style for each hair length (especially at the interview process)?

","['Google STAR interview questions, that will be the outline for your phone interview.  Someone said that Delta has recently changed the phone interview to a ""video"" interview.  If this is true, I\'m sure it\'s like American and US Airways are doing now in that it\'s pre-recorded questions and you use the webcam on your computer to record your answers, and they will be reviewed later by Delta, it\'s not actually live.  Make sure to look the part.  Hair slicked back and completely out of your face, classic makeup (do not skip the lipstick), wear a suit and pearls ($5 pearls from Claires is perfectly fine).  SMILE!  Be professional, confident, and kind.  It might be cheesy, but for any sort of phone or video interview I like to put a sticky note near by with notes to myself (""Smile!"" even for phone interviews, they can hear it in your voice! and the other notes that I know will come up during the interview, such as strengths and weaknesses, customer service and safety/security).  Make sure to bring up customer service more than once.  Delta is big on that.\n\nWhen it comes time to the face to face interview (because lets be real you\'ll rock the phone/video interview) again, look the part.  Skirt suit, nude panty hose, 3 inch heels (no higher!).  It will likely be a ""cattle call"" which means you\'ll show up to a room with 50 other candidates.  Do NOT be late or you will NOT be interviewed.  They\'ll tell you when the doors open, be there then to sign in.  Triple check to make sure you have all the items they requested you bring.  As soon as you walk through the door, you\'re on.  Sit up straight, don\'t play with your hair, make friendly conversation with the other candidates.  If there\'s any sort of Q&A, ask intelligent questions.  When it comes time to your interview, don\'t tell them you love to travel.  Tell them about your customer service experience, your admiration of the company, how excited you are to bring your experiences to an industry you\'re passionate about.  If they ask you any questions that makes it seem like they\'re trying to steer you away from becoming a flight attendant, direct it back to WHY you want to be a flight attendant.  They\'re testing you.\n\nFrom what I know about the last time Delta was hiring, if they want to hire you they will give you a conditional offer the day of the interview, pending passing a background check and drug test.  If you do drugs, stop.  Right now.  \n\nUhhhh I think that\'s all I\'ve got for you.  Good luck!\n\nSource:  Flight attendant (non-Delta) who has been to more airline interviews than I can count.', 'While customer service is huge, make sure you emphasize safety as well.

Retail experience is still great because even though safety is a huge portion of our job, customer service is what we do while we're in the air, therefore they like to see that you always greet people with a smile and you have good service to offer.\n\nAnother key point: always look your best and always look professional. Brand image is another big one for airlines. If you're going to a one on one interview, wear a nice skirt with heels (not more than 3 inches), with a nice blouse and blazer.

If you're based in ATL/NYC/DTW/MSP, your schedule value will be roughly ~70 hours including the 6 days of reserve. As a junior FA, you'll probably get all weekend trips.

I received an e-mail asking for my travel documentation, so I'm assuming that I'm probably moving forward... But I might be jumping to conclusions. I did the video interview a couple of nights ago. 

If I am moving forward, this will be my second time attending and I'm wondering what questions I should bring for the flight attendants performing the interview? Should I ask questions work experience, scenarios, job duties? What do you think? Also any kind of suggestions would be helpful on how to land the job. I know how to dress/behave, but where I failed last time was my lack of social interaction with the FAs and the other interviewees. Some of my responses to the F2F interview questions may have been ill prepared too (I got one on changing priorities on some project outside of work... I'm a planner and rarely have to do things like that... ugh!) 

Also, would it be a good idea to avoid conversations around my family that works for the airline? I'm assuming yes, but that's how I related to the airlines...

For now you will get uniforms that will most likely not fit, and about $50 a paycheck will be deducted until 6 months, when Endeavor will provide up to half of the money per the contract. You get paid the 1st and 16th. $50 union dues will also get deducted after month three I think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTravel Benefits: You can JUMPSEAT on any plane that has a JUMPSEAT and get on any Delta flight if there is a seat. \n\nThe training is great.

Your life is owned by the gods of your schedule. It's almost like being in an abusive relationship. I had read a few books written by former FAs and crew husbands, and it gave me a much better understanding of expectations. My ex was married to her job, and I was always second. I learned to not mind it, and of course, YMMV. I quickly learned why so many pilots and FAs end up in relationships, they get the quirks of the job in a way normal people don't. \n\n3. Traveling together is simultaneously easier and harder. Yes, you can save money on trips together with cheaper airfare, but most people don't understand what standby travel is like. I've had to cancel two trips we had planned for months because of getting bumped off a flight when I can only take these days off work. Even harder is that most normal people's vacation time won't match with yours, like holidays. You learn to be spontaneous and be grateful for what you have.  \n\n1. When you're on reserve, quality time is hard. You can't make dates that can't get cancelled or interrupted on a dime and you'll kind of habitually check your phone a lot. This is good if you're just relaxing at home, cooking and watching TV together, but not if you want to go out and do something. \n\nThat said, it's definitely possible and plenty of FAs have perfectly healthy relationships. It's about finding someone equally emotionally independent and appreciate the space when you're gone, and knowing how to communicate and set up those schedules ahead of time. There are amazing parts of the job like being able to travel together that you'll appreciate. Also, it's easier to date someone who is more financially secure, it sounds bad, but it really does make a big difference. \n"", ""I sort-of agree. I got a 5 day trip, then two days off, then another 4 day trip. It's very hard on anyone to be in a relationship with someone they never see. I am not saying it's impossible, but I think in the EARLY stages of relationships, people want attention. They want dates. They want the cuddles and the fun. Having to wait sucks. Plus, if you are a commuter and you have a crash pad, it's even worse. \n\nEveryone is different, but when I am on the road I spend most time in hotels sleeping. When I am home, I am doing laundry and house stuff."", 'Anything is possible, but not probable.', 'I also met a woman who flies for SkyWest. \n\nShe has a boyfriend in North Carolina, AND\n\nShe has a boyfriend in Minneapolis.\n\nShe is all about free rent and food because the pay was so low.', 'I totally only did 2 or 3 day trips.

Aspiring flight attendant here. I‚Äôve been a silent lurker for the most part, occasionally leaving some comments here and there, but decided to gather the nerve to make my first post. 

I‚Äôve been putting my dream of becoming a FA on hold for quite some time now, but I‚Äôd like to start making it a reality soon.

I‚Äôm aware that the application process is a lengthy one, and I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs best to keep/not leave my current job until I get a CJO/training date. 

My question is, will the airlines I apply for contact my current workplace/employer? How does that usually work? I‚Äôm just afraid of my current workplace/employer finding out that I plan on leaving them, and idk what to think/do about that. That said, if I passed the F2F and scored a CJO/training date, then will I have at least two weeks to put in my two weeks‚Äô notice?

I appreciate any advice and/or feedback from you guys, and thank you in advance.","['I had no problem with mine.  The only time I had an issue was when I was called to go fly out and get my ID and drug test done. But by then I knew I needed to give notice.   It also wasn‚Äôt quite two weeks notice as class started 10 days later.  It completely depends on when the class date starts. ', ""The airline shouldn't contact your current job unless they've already given you a CJO, and even then, I know so many people who got a CJO at their interview, but didn't get a start date for training for 6 months. It's definitely best to keep your current job and keep applying! I work for Delta and they retroactively offered CJO's to like 100 people who didn't get one at their face to face interviews. Once they contact you to begin training, that's when you'll absolutely need to put notice in. Until then, keep that paycheck coming! (Because you will be broke by the end of training) :)"", 'The airline I work for contacted my past employers after I received my job offer at the f2f. ', 'Thank you for responding! Can you tell me what you mean by, ‚ÄúThe only time I had an issue...‚Äù? Was that after your F2F and you had to request day(s) off from your workplace to fly out to get your ID and drug test done? So in that scenario, it‚Äôs a shoo-in that they‚Äôre offering you a CJO? \n\nI guess 10 days isn‚Äôt so bad. It‚Äôs not ideal as I‚Äôd like to give my current employer a traditional two weeks‚Äô notice and leave on a positive note, but honestly, if I score a CJO for my dream job, they‚Äôll just have to understand.', 'Ahhh... okay. Thank you so much for your response! I‚Äôve never really applied for jobs while I was currently employed, so I‚Äôm not familiar with the process. I just assumed the new place would be looking at my resume, scope out my current job, and call for references, but I‚Äôm glad that might not be the case here. \n\nThank you again for your feedback and advice! It was very informative and reassuring. \n\nI‚Äôll definitely have to start saving up! Now, can you tell me if Delta has paid training? And if it‚Äôs not too much to ask, can you tell me more about your time as a DL FA? How long have you been there and how was it (the company lifestyle, the pay, etc.) like when you first started and is it much more manageable now?', '\nThe issue was being I had a short time before class. Some people had more time.  Like I said it just varied to when you start class.   I also had to take a day for my drug test and ID. They told me I as the job pending my drug test. I did test positive but just needed to send the drug testing company a photo of my narcotic. Once that was done they gave me my start date . ', ""Absolutely! \nYes, Delta's training is paid, but it isn't very much. I think it comes out to around $200 each...week? Every other week? It's been almost 4 years since I was in training so I don't remember how often we got paid, just that by the end I was struggling. Everybody was living on noodles! \n\nThe job is TOUGH when you first start. For at least the first 6-8 months you're essentially at the bottom of the barrel, so you get some pretty ugly trips assigned to you, and when you're on call (which is required 6 days out of the month, except for that lucky most, MOST junior person in the base who gets 9 days) you're the first one to be called for that 5am report time. The airline basically owns you. \n\nBut, like I said, I'm almost 4 years now and it's a different world. I can avoid trips with 4 flights per day (usually) I get most of the days off that I ask for (usually) I've held Halloween and Thanksgiving off every year since my first year (knock on wood), I can't get Christmas off though. If you're a family person, the holidays are tricky. \n\nAnother tricky part is choosing what base to go to and where to live. Delta has bases all over the country, but when you first get out of training, you'll only have a few to choose from, and you might have to end up moving across the country like I did, and just put in for a transfer every month until a spot opens up in the base you want to work at. You can also commute, and be in your base city when you're working, and then on your days off you fly home. Commuting sucks SO much, but sometimes you have to do it when things like kids or spouses are involved, and you can't just pick up and move crazy far away.\n\nThe pay is great though. As of October 1st, the new hourly wage for brand new hires is $29.76.\nPlus you get to fly anywhere you want for free in America, and to travel abroad, you only pay taxes on your return ticket. I went to Italy last summer and I only paid $40 round trip. And I got to sit in first class both ways.\n\nIt is an entire life adjustment, and honestly it can be really discouraging for pretty much the whole first year. Especially since our calling put sick policy is kind of a joke, and if you call out for any reason more than three times a year, you can get fired. But you get a raise every year, you get to see the whole world, you get to meet celebrities when they're on your flight, and you get a ton of days off (I was just off of work for 9 days in a row). "", 'Ah, I see. Thanks for the clarification! So it sounds like the training start date is really my green light to start notifying my current workplace. That‚Äôs good to know. Thank you!', 'So all you had to do was show a picture of the narcotic? No doctors note or legal documents?', 'Thank you so much for taking the time to post this comment. This answered so many questions I have! ', 'Yes. Just remember that you‚Äôre not officially hired until you‚Äôre done.  Consider it a prolonged application period.  Make sure you‚Äôre always dressed and made up properly during class other than pool day. Most tests require 80-100% passing with some not allowing retests.  It‚Äôs a hard month to two depending on where you go. ', 'Correct. All I did was take a picture of the bottle of my narcotic, send it back to the drug testing company, they had the information to contact the doctor that way if necessary but they didn‚Äôt need to and a few hours later I received my CJO']"

My sister works for Delta, so that was my goal, but I juuust missed the application window. I'm hoping that having some experience will help me sail through the Delta interviews their next time around.


I'd just like to know about your experience with GoJet! What's the reserve time like? 

The website says ""guaranteed 75 flight hours a month,"" how true is that and when does it start?

 Training is 6 weeks in MO. What's that like? What's the hotel like? What was it like getting to and from the hotel? Do we know when training starts? 

Boyfriend is excited to be my travel companion. I was my sister's for 2 years, so I generally understand how standby works, but is there anything he needs to know about traveling with GoJet? His family lives in Iraq, so we're hoping he can visit them through another airline, but I've only ever flown with Delta, and even then it was nerve wracking wondering if we would get a seat assignment.


When I applied it was specifically for DTW. Am I guaranteed to be based there?


My sister has a lot of freedom with re-arranging her schedule, dropping and picking up trips, etc. But she had to learn how to do this herself. How is the flexibility of GoJets schedule? Do they teach you how to manipulate your shifts during training?


Any interview tips specific to GoJet or the DTW base? Are you going to the interview, too? Questions? Comments? Anything you have I'll be glad to take!","[""Do not go to GoJet.\n\nI work for a competitor regional. All regionals work the same.\n\nYou will make $18 per flight hour, with a guarantee of 75 flight hours per month. On Average, you will make about $16,000-$20,000 per month. \n\nNow, what that means, is that $18 per flight hour is NOT the same as $18 per hour. In fact, you have to be at the plane an hour before hand, unpaid, to board and serve drinks. You also have to be there for up to 30 minutes after you land to deplane and help off handicap people also unpaid. So that $18/flight hour is really about $10/hour. Also, if you did 4 short trips, like NYC -SYR, SYR-NYC, NYC-SYR, SYR-NYC you will work 9 hours, for about 2 flight hours, basically making $36 for 9 hours. Far below minimum wage. You also get per diem, $1.70, so basically, you will add $15 to that $36, so you are making about $50 for 9 hours duty time. \n\nNow, you have to understand, all are organized differently. After one year, will get a raise of about $4 per flight hour, and your pay will go from $16k to about $22k per year. \n\nTo make matters worse, your food options on the road are airport food which is stupid expensive, and restaurants inside hotels which is also expensive. \n\nThe CRJ 700 planes suck.

The Delta interview is up first out in New York and I had some questions to prepare myself a little better for it. First question I had was what is the process of confirming if a tattoo is acceptable or not? I have one tattoo on my arm and though it may not show in business professional/casual outfits it slightly shows while wearing a short sleeve. I was wondering what kind of test does Delta do to find out if that okay. As for the second question would be about my hair. I have fairly long hair and plan to go for a more conservative cut of course for these face to face interviews, but I look fairly young when go fully shaven on with facial hair. Should I get a very short clean shave with facial hair or would it be best to just take it all off?

Endeavor is the Regional Airline for Delta Mainline. Skywest is ALSO a regional airline for Delta but it's NOT owned by Delta.

If you tell them, they will disqualify you, and if you lie and they see it, they will fire you. \n\nI recommend shaving. Grow it back once you get the CJO. They are funny about men with facial hair. I have seen some black men with a mustache and chin hair (like a goatee kind of thing) and they got the job because it still looks very conservative and they are handsome. \n\nI think there is a thing about long hair. I think it has to be up for safety reasons, like when on the plane your hair must be up in case you have to wear the PBE. I don't think you can have hair touching your collar. (I might be wrong on this)\n\nAnyway, understand that Airlines want someone conservative. They have an image and if you have long hair and a beard (i.e. Hipster) they might not hire you.

I have military experience and recommendations that I hope will temper the lack of conservatism for having tattoos.  That said I know Deltas core values include honesty.

I have three tattoos that are concerning.  

One is one my wrist about 1""x1"" and can be completely covered by a watch and not visible - had it in the military and thats the only way I was able to get in with it is that its completely coverable.

&#x200B;

I have two more - one on each forearm - about 2""x2"" which could obviously be covered by any long sleeve attire options.

That said, should I maintain a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and cover them up with makeup and a wristwatch OR should I just be 100% upfront and hope that my military background will help temper the disdain?

Military or not, you‚Äôll be disqualified immediately.', ""I have seen this question about tattoos again and again in this reddit.  My answer has always been:  Apply, and see what happens.   When I went through my interviews a long time ago, I didn't have any tattoos, and wasn't asked if I did.  I honestly don't remember anyone with tattoos in my training class.  That was over 30 years ago.  Now I would imagine, for a company to say we don't want people with tattoos is to seriously limiting their hiring pool.  I know that there are lots of new flight attendants that have tattoos and although the company's policy is to have them concealed, many have smaller tattoos on hands, wrists, fingers and necks that they do not bother concealing.  I am sure, however that they are through their 'initial proving' period that must be passed before becoming permanent employees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what Delta's rules are, but I have always been an advocate of telling the truth.

During the water training, you‚Äôd have to wear something that completely covers them (long-sleeve wetsuit top), otherwise, they‚Äôll let you go immediately.

The other girl has a tattoo on the top of her foot and one on her wrist. She is able to cover the wrist up with a watch, or even a bracelet, and her feet are always covered with opaque tights or trouser socks. I‚Äôm waiting for a response from her currently, but it may matter less cause she‚Äôs with Endeavor, but he has told me before (when I first started in this industry) when I was considering tattoos, to make sure that I disclose them when asked to do so, ensure they‚Äôre able to be hidden in uniform, and hidden on layovers. \n\nI‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre not exceptions, I know that tattoos are not a desirable trait for most airlines - but as we go deeper into the 21st century, airlines that had previously banned them entirely are becoming more lax. I worked for a mainline and am currently in transition to another mainline and both had strict policies within the last three-five years, and it‚Äôs absolutely relaxed a bit.

I've been thinking more and more over the past couple years about becoming a flight attendant, and pulled the trigger on some applications over the past few months. I've spent some time reading over threads in this subreddit, and various AMAs, but I had a few specific questions here. 

1) I've got a F2F with PSA on Wednesday - can anyone lend any insight as to what they're like? I know it's a regional airline so shorter routes (and less pay) operating as American Express, but that's about it.

2) I applied for AA back in December, did the assessment a few days later, and then did the VI a couple of weeks ago. I'm waiting to hear back on F2F for them as well; any advice? Or am I just in the ""hurry up and wait"" stage?

3) I applied for Delta back in August, did the video interview about a week later, then the assessment about 2.5 months later...and haven't heard anything since. Although on Delta's website, it says my application is still ""under review"" (though its archived now). 

4) I know that, starting off, the pay is rough; how does everyone adapt at first? Also, in the event I need relocate (which I almost certainly will have to, as my current hometown isn't a hub), I've been told there are resources that help FA's help find affordable housing. Where do you folks recommend I start my search?

Thanks in advance, and I look forward to hearing responses.","['PSA is a regional. You get paid $18/flight hour which works out to about $9 per hour plus per diem.

They will advertise ""$18-$28/flight hour, but for each flight, you generally have 2 to 3 hours of commute, prep, clean, whatever, so that you are LUCKY to do 100 hours of flight time per month. Now, say you got lucky and landed Delta Mainline, at $28/flight hour. That means, at 100 hours per month, you made $2800 plus per diem. That\'s amazing, because it means you made $17.50/hr based on a 40 hour work week. Most regionals are $18/flight hour, which works out to about $11.25/hr based on a 40 hour work week. So, essentially you get paid more to wash dishes at red lobster, than be in charge of the lives of 79 passengers.  So, before you jump, make sure you have support. Training for most regionals is not paid, but for most mainlines, it is paid. \n\n3. How do you find a job? Make a list of all the regionals, then make a list of all the regionals in your area. You can commute, but it\'s VERY hard. Apply to all of them. Do the same for mainline carriers. They usually hire in September.

I'm seriously considering quitting my desk job and becoming a flight attendant. Since I can remember I've had an adventurous need to travel and NOT have an ordinary desk job. I'm just not happy behind a desk in front of a computer. I feel the need to move, talk, smile, walk, etc. A few years back I worked on a cruise ship after quitting a corporate job, but after a year felt that the role was too restrictive \(you're completely away from home for 6\-8 months, little wifi, etc.\). I then got another desk job, but still find myself wanting something with more flexibility that allows me to travel, adventure, meet people, and hopefully also have some time to dedicate to other hobbies and really flexible side hustles. Basically I think flight attending might be a good way to fulfill that non\-negotiable adventure bone, while also having a home base to come back to, be able to maintain friendships at home, etc.  I also feel the need to be challenged, and do wonder if being a flight attendant would be challenging enough \- I would love your thoughts on this in particular, too.

I'm looking for any and all thoughts on the matter and SO appreciate you taking time to impart some wisdom on someone who feels a little lost but is hoping that this may be the path forward.

220,Tips and Tricks to Get Through,28,99emol,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/99emol/tips_and_tricks_to_get_through/,8,1534982929.0,"Everyone keeps wanting to know the same questions, so here is my summary as best as I can get. I have posted this before in and out of other comments, and hopefully this will narrow it down and help you. I applied to 4 regionals, got 3 interviews, (one I later declined), and got both offers from the ones I interviewed with. The one regional I didn't get was because I have more than 5 jobs in 5 years, and a non-visible tattoo. So, here is my thoughts to help you:

1. If you are serious about being an FA, it might take you a year or more to get through several applications before being hired. I strongly recommend you take any medical classes like 'First Aid' or 'Basic CPR' to add to your application. (both are generally one day classes and not expensive) Airlines seem to all screen for medical and fine dining backgrounds. I was an Emergency Medical Technician, and for whatever reason, it was on every application I did and helped me get through. Also, any high end waiter jobs are also VERY helpful as is bartending. Avoid having 'too many jobs' hurt me.  **** Before even applying, know the height requirements and tattoo policy. If you are too short or too tall or have a large visible tattoo you will immediately be cut. Don't even apply and go through the process as it's a waste of your time. **** Have a MATCHING passport and state ID. We had one applicant have a married name on her papers, but her maiden name on her passport and she was going to be cut. She could prove she applied for an updated passport and made it through barely. Make sure your stuff matches.

2. Have to do a video interview? Here is what you should know. Most video interviews are of you, answering a question in under a minute from your laptop or cell phone. Some you can do over and over until you get it right. I would actually set up a test ahead of time. Use your laptop camera and video yourself against a solid wall background. Wear a blazer and shirt, and make sure the audio is clean and clear. When doing your videos, avoid 'uh's and 'um's. Speak very slowly and also if you can, write down common phrases ahead of time and sprinkle them into your video interview. Things like 'I am a great candidate for your airline because I am on time, work efficiently, and am perfect at solving customer issues to retain customer loyalty."" Sprinkle educated phrases like this ahead to seem smart and confident. Anytime you can throw in '..helping you make an informed, intelligent decision about hiring me...' goes a long way. 

3. Going to your face to face? YAY! Here is what you should know. 

(A) If you are male, shave. No beards, hipster stuff, earrings, rings, tattoos, or anything that makes you who you are. Your goal is to look like a conservative bank teller. If you are a lady, dress conservative also, no wisps of hair in your face. use lots of spray and hair gel or product and tie your hair back in a bun. Hair should be off of the neck. I think if you have braids/dreads as long as it's tied back you should be ok. No black lipstick. No dangly earrings or anything like that. Google bank teller and that's what you want to look like. Dark blazers, dark pants. Conservative. Look the part. No hipster rings on your hands, or funky watches. One ring. One watch. Maybe a bracelet but I would avoid it. 

(B). Pick your favorite paragraph from your favorite book. Stand in front of a mirror. Try and smile and read it aloud. Read it very very slowly. You will be nervous when you do it, and so your brain will want to read fast, so read slow so it sounds normal when you do it. During the interview, you will be handed a safety paragraph you will be expected to read loudly. Smile, read it aloud slowly. You may be in front of a hundred people, so I hope you are confident in being in front of lots of people. I watched an applicant get up in front of a hundred people, freeze up and cry. Don't be that applicant.

(C) Customer turnaround. Know a well thought out story about a time when you turned around an angry customer into a happy one. Be able to smile as you are saying it, and get it to about a minute long. No 'um's or 'uh's. Speak slow, and with purpose. Pretend you are a stand up comedian in that you should be active, command attention, even talk with your hands if need be. If you stand up like a frozen nervous lump, you will get cut. I actually wrote mine out so I could practice ahead of time and could recite it reasonably well. 

(D) Interview. Mention in the interview how much fun it was to learn CPR and First Aid, and how fascinated you are in learning safety procedures aboard Aircraft. Try and slip it in there when they ask you why you feel you are a great candidate. It might help you get through it. Avoid cliche stuff like 'I'm great with people'. Instead say things like 'I am a master at creating dynamic solutions on the fly to help solve issues angry customers face'. They will look for steps to turn an angry customer, like 'Listen, empthathize, apologize, and propose a solution. (L.E.A.P.)

(E) RESEARCH your airline. I guarantee they will ask you 'What do you know about us?'. Go to the airline's website and know that they operate a fleet of 150 jets and fly to over 180 US Destinations plus Canada and the Caribbean. Know they have about 5,000 employees. Know they have 5 US Bases.

(F) If they ask you if you will relocate, ALWAYS say yes. 99.9% of the time you know the base you are hired for so you know where you have to move to. You can always decline later if you are about to start training and feel you don't want to relocate. 

4. Pay. Before you even apply, make sure you have two full months of money set aside as most training is not paid. Regional training is 4 weeks and up to two weeks for your 3-day initial operating experience. This means it can be two full months before getting a paycheck. Also, $18/flight hour is NOT $18/hr but rather about $9/hr. You don't do this for the money. Regional Airlines like Compass/Endeavor Air/SkyWest/PSA/CommutAir are domestic and fly from Canada to the Bahamas. Mainline such as Delta/American/United fly internationally and can pay as much as $28/flight hour, which is substantially more. Know the money and the facts before.

Anyways, this is my summary so far. I may edit it in the future, but I hope this helps all of you get through and join me in the air. Best of luck!","['TL;DR but my best tip for any interview situation is that the story you tell, or the answer you give to a question like ""Tell me about a time that you provided great customer service"" can be 100% false and no one will know. If you\'re quick on your feet you can ace any interview. ', 'This is all excellent information, but upon hire your medical skills from basic survival/first aid classes will be kind of moot as you learn how to use emergency procedures per the airline protocol, they don‚Äôt care if you have certification because in the event of emergency you‚Äôll be practicing Good Samaritan care - not certified (insert training here) and unless operating an AED you‚Äôll be under direction from medlink or a similar company, if a doctor on board isn‚Äôt doing it for you. \n\nIt looks good, comes slightly in handy, doesn‚Äôt make all the difference however. \n\nThe rest is spot on! ', 'Is southwest mainline or is it another name? Are we the odd ones?', ""Right. You won't get to USE any of your information, but every application I have filled out (4) has asked if you have HAD medical training. For whatever reason, they seem to feel they make the best candidates."", 'Southwest is mainline. ', 'Lol Southwest is Mainline. ', 'Absolutely. Any medical experience means you‚Äôre equipped for crisis, and probably good at stress management. ', 'Phewww scared']"

I see everywhere online that the starting pay is $39. Is this really true? Also, I heard Delta has the best reputation as the best airline to work for so how come Southwest airlines gets paid a whole $10 more. Just curious because when I looked up Southwest flights when I was going on vacation the tickets were around $230, but for Delta airlines the starting tickets was $500+, I would think because Delta receives more money in tickets, that they would pay more. Guess not, either way $28 per flight hour is still cool with me!","['There are so many factors that go in to answering this question.  I‚Äôve been working at my airline for 12 years and I still have to study my pay check to understand it.  Base pay is one factor to consider but there are so many other things to think about.  When looking at base pay, is it calculated using flight hours (block in to block out) or check in to check out.  Is there profit sharing?  Are there other potential bonuses, at my airline we have two other ways to earn bonuses.  How long are the duty days?  12.5 hours vs. 10.5 hours.  What are the medical benefits?  What is the culture like? What are the retirement benefits?  What is the 401K match? Is there an employee stock purchase plan?  How fast do you top out on the base pay?  Is the flight attendant group part of a Union?  Is there longevity pay?  Base pay is a one thing to consider, but it‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.  ', ""Regional pay is about $18/flight hour, which works out to about $9/actual hour. \n\nMainline pay is generally $28/flight hour, which works out to about $17/hour. \n\nAlso, you have to understand, like in the case of a regional, if you are on a turn, it can be really bad. Say you flew JFK to Syracuse and back. It's one hour of flight time each way, with 1.5 hours in between. You need an hour before at the gate for boarding at each flight, so basically, you get to the gate at 12 noon, and fly from 1pm to 2 pm, get off, get a soda for 30 minutes, at 2:30 you start the boarding process again, for a 3:30 flight. You land at 4:30, and then have about 15 minutes to deplane and call scheduling. So in this scenario, you have been away from base for 4 hours and 45 minutes (including your 30 minute break). You would get 2 hours of flight, at $18/hr, so basically $36 for 4.75 hours away from home, or $7.57 per hour away from base. Now, lets say you don't count your break time. I do, because it's time I can't work somewhere else. I consider it 'lost time' because if I worked a 9-5, I consider my commute lost time when I figure out the number of hours of my life this job is taking, and the pay I am getting. But, let's deduct that 30 minute break. So, now you are at 4.25 hours at $36  or $8.47 per hour. \n\nNow, let's say you worked for mainline. You get $28/flight hour, BUT you get better flights that are much longer. So, you fly JFK to Denver and back. It's 4 hours each way, so in the above scenario, you are now working 1+4+1.5+4+.25, or 10.75 total hours, but you are making 8 x $28=$224 or about $20.83 per hour.

At Alaska we have a 10.5 hr duty day, meaning our schedule can only be built to 10.5 hours.   It can certainly go over due to delays but when that happens we are compensated with extra pay or extra rest or both.  We have the shortest duty day in the industry for domestic carriers.   Most of the others have duty days that can be built to 12, 14 even 16 hours.  That is just one highlight but our union fought hard to keep this.  Every time we go up for contract negotiations the company wants to up our duty day...   Crew rest is another big one!  Also, our union fights for all FAs in front of the FAA, Congress, OSHA, etc., to make our lives safer.   \n\nOne other thing is the protection aspect should the need arise.  While most of us are good employees & follow the company rules & FARs (federal regulations) we do live in a world where passengers & even other employees may video tape you & send it in to make trouble for you.  Or passengers may write a bad letter about you.  It‚Äôs nice to have union representation & a discipline process in writing.  \n\nFinal thought, being pro-union does not make one anti-company.   Our union works well with the company to make things as good as possible.  ', 'Yeah I don‚Äôt want to go into much more detail but it‚Äôs the best choice IMO when it comes to an airline.

224,Delta FA's! I need advice!,3,38hm2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/38hm2r/delta_fas_i_need_advice/,1,1433430709.0,"Hey folks!

I've just started the digital interview process, which is all very exciting, but I have some questions for those who are or who know Delta FA's. 

Assuming I'm even hired, what then? Do I get to choose my home base or will it be assigned to me? Do you have any say in the matter? 

What's the scheduling like? How many hours/days a week?

I really have no idea what to expect, so any advice would be appreciated! ","['You will ""bid"" for the base you want, however, base assignments are given based on company needs. Therefor, you will be placed in the base where FAs are needed, you do not have a choice. However, you will ultimately get the base you want when your seniority can hold it, and there is a spot open. \nAs far as scheduling, it is very varied. You will never work more than 7 days without a 24hr period off due to legal restrictions but will often be scheduled 6 days in a row, on reserve. Daily hours can be anywhere from 4-12 hour duty time. You will never be scheduled for more than 12hrs in a day, however you can work up to 16hrs if there are irregular operations (delays etc). Some days a incredibly long, some short and sweet. Try googling ""life of a flight attendant"" or something to that affect. There\'s is a wealth of info on the Internet to answer these basic questions. Good luck!

This is mostly because I want to work my way into the international routes. Might be a hot topic but any opinions on these three and where they rank internally?

To be completely honest I've based my past  jobs around this dream to gain experience. I've worked in nothing but customer service since I was 15. Food/retail and a five star hotel. I worked a stint as a TSA officer so I know most of the safety rules for airlines on the ground and a basic understanding of air safety as well as the unseen dangers FAs face.

Safety should be the first thing on your mind at all times. Even if you‚Äôre telling a story that‚Äôs about customer service, find a way to at least mention safety.\n\nLearn to tell stories using the STAR method. S=Situation. Set up the story, what was happening. T=Thoughts.

What you did to resolve the issue. R=Resolution. What ended up happening.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever been in an emergency situation, absolutely bring that up. Even if it wasn‚Äôt at work.

This happens through the eustachian tube that connects the middle ear to the back of your throat. When you swallow, it is supposed to open and make the pressure in your middle the same as what's around you. But when you're in a plane, it doesn't always have a chance to do that with the rapid pressure change and it gets stuck, making everything sound like you're in a barrel. This causes a slight conductive hearing loss while it's happening, but that is only while your ears aren't equalized.

240,Got invited to Hiring Event for Endeavor Air.

There were about 40 of us there. The first thing that needed to be done was pass a height, reach and tattoos test, and to also sit in the jump seat (No, they do not check you for tattoos, but they will ask you.) When it comes to tattoos, it will be up to you whether you want to lie about it or not. Personally, I have seen people enter the height/reach test room and not come back to the group (meaning they were eliminated due to having tattoos in visible places, not being tall enough to reach the height test, or not being able to fit in the jump seat. This left us with a group of about 30 people. During all of this, there were two fellow flight attendants who were answering a variety of questions that we had after they showed us the slideshow of the company and what they offer. Next, each person was to be called up in front of the room one-by- one to present to everyone there most negative customer service experience that turned out to be positive. This they definitely judge you on because whoever does a good job goes to the next step of the hiring process. With this presentation, they judge you on whether you know how to communicate without getting nervous, they rate you on how loud you are, how fast you talk, eye contact, and things of that nature. If you don‚Äôt do well you will be eliminated. The final process of the hiring event, which I made it to was the face-to face interview with one of the recruiters. Boy was I nervous!! I tell you, this is an all day event of elimination! But I made it to the face-to-face and was sure I would get me a CJO. We were told that after the face-to-face we would be fingerprinted and then sent for a drug test on the very same day but in a different facility that we would need to drive to, or carpool if other attendees are nice. Finally it was my turn for the face-to face. I was so nervous, I feel as though I gave to much of an answer with every question. The more I talked, the more I feel like the CJO was just slipping out of my hands. I knew I wasn‚Äôt getting hired once I seen how the recruiter was getting annoyed at me because of how I was answering the STAR questions. Every single person that ended up having the face-to-face that day got a CJO. Maybe Im stretching it a little but I‚Äôm sure maybe one or two (not including myself) did not get a CJO. I was very upset, crying tearing. It was bad, but it only prepared me to get a better position at a Mainline.","['Delta opens hiring the 13th, good luck.', 'Delta Mainline is open now!

241,Previous Airline Experience‚ÄîAn asset or a setback?,4,8zfhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/8zfhuv/previous_airline_experiencean_asset_or_a_setback/,10,1531808557.0,"Long time lurker on this subreddit, and was hoping to find some more opinions on this.
I‚Äôm currently in the application process for Mesa since it‚Äôs one of the few companies that hires younger than 21 (I just turned 20). My dream is to work international flights for major airlines as I‚Äôm bilingual, and my initial idea was that already having a year of flight attendant experience by the time I‚Äôm 21 would help me get my foot in the door in majors like United/Delta earlier. 
I‚Äôm starting to get doubts though, as I see some people say having previous experience is actually a setback? I‚Äôve heard some bad things about Mesa, but I‚Äôm more than willing to work a year there if it means it‚Äôll help my chances. But if it doesn‚Äôt actually help... is it worth quitting my current job (I‚Äôm currently an airport receptionist) which actually pays more? Should I just wait until I‚Äôm 21 and apply to majors then? Any advice/opinions are super appreciated!!!","['I think it all just depends. Overall I would say an asset. You‚Äôll have relevant work experience. I know a couple of people that start out at smaller airlines or connection carriers and get hired with a legacy carrier. ', 'Do you plan on getting your college degree?  I don‚Äôt know whether that would be more beneficial than getting a job at Mesa but I personally value candidates with pervious airline experience because it shows that they know the drill...the lingo, the vagaries of weather and how it affects the operation, the non-‚Äònormal‚Äô schedule and lifestyle, etc.  That they know all this, and still choose this profession says a lot.  A college degree is valuable in my opinion too; even if you never do what you studied in college.  It gives you a few years to ‚Äògrow up‚Äô  and it shows that you have some perseverance.  You have to decide the best path for you but in answer to your question, I don‚Äôt think doing a stint at Mesa would in any way negatively impact your chances of getting on with a major. ', ""Based on discussions I've had with my instructors about this, I'd say that it may not be viewed as a negative, but it won't really be viewed as a positive either. Having worked for another airline won't give you an advantage or a 'foot in the door' in this industry (at least in regards to the airline I work for). \n\nI won't recommend working for another airline unless it's because you WANT to work there. If you're just wanting to market yourself better to legacy carriers, the most beneficial things you can do to get hired is have prior customer service experience, a college degree, know another language, and/or have some experience in a safety-related job. Those will be the things that will have the most influence on you getting hired. (And, seeing as you are bilingual and currently work in customer service as an airport receptionist, I'd say you're doing pretty well already!)"", 'Often you can work for Endeavor Air and then transfer-apply after one year I think. Endeavor is the regional and is owned by delta.', 'Mesa pays really bad. I was with them for 6months. I would stick with where you are ,but if you want it badly then go to mesa.', 'Yes, those language skills are definitely a differentiator!    And a college degree is not the be all end all.   Sometimes though, it‚Äôs a box that has to be checked.  It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve flown commercially so I don‚Äôt know if they require a degree.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre more knowledgeable about their hiring requirements than I.  Best of luck in your job search!  Being a flight attendant is a great career choice for many people and even if it‚Äôs not your ultimate career it affords a lot of cool life experiences.  There are definitely challenges, so if you do get hired promise that you keep yourself relevant and marketable so if one day you find yourself no longer loving what you do you have the option of doing something else. ', 'Most of our people at Mesa end up going to Southwest at some point for some reason.  I know lots of former Mesa people who went to Delta, JetBlue, United, American, and I‚Äôm sure some others.  Most of us at Mesa are very hard workers and the majors know this.  I‚Äôve enjoyed working for Mesa, and the people here really are like family that you work with.  ', ""I've heard this too.

Unfortunately its simply too expensive and I‚Äôm currently working full time at my local airport which I really enjoy. I‚Äôm hoping that by the time I‚Äôm 21, my 4 years of customer service experience and then 1 year of FA experience on top of that will help my chances despite the lack of degree.
