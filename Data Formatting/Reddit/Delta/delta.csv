9,Scary/awesome landing today,45,dljr4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dljr4y/scaryawesome_landing_today/,16,1571787973.0,"Wanted to throw some love to the delta team today. Flight DL 2872 from SAN to SLC was diverted to LAX because our landing gear got stuck in the down position after take off. Let me tell you, no imagination suffices to express the fear that ANY problem with landing gear yields while airborne. The crew and the pilots kept the cabin amazingly calm and after a nice little tour (40 laps) above San Diego, we landed in LA due to their longer runway. The pilots absolutely buttered the landing and all was without issue (bonus points for a full emergency crew greeting on the runway). Never been happier to fly with a specific carrier than I was after we rolled to a stop and the pilot came over the PA to appraise us of what happened. Fly delta jets 4 life!

My wife flies with me often, and we can usually use it to offset the cost of a $5-600 flight, so it pays for itself.  If you have a regular travel companion, I'd suggest looking at the platinum, but if not, then CSR or Amex platinum is likely going to do you better.

Both of these planes are awfully loud and super dated. I sat in exit rows both flights and was really surprised there was no extra legroom on the MD90. American already retired theirs, what is Delta waiting for?","['I rather fly a MD88 than a CRJ200.

I'd imagine they'll all be out of service within the next 5 to 10 years."", ""The MD88 is actually one tough plane. It was an absolute tank, and one of very few airframes without a viable retirement date since it was so well built. I mean, we call it the Mad Dog for a reason. Some people in aircraft maintenance like to joke that the MD88 put McDonnell Douglas out of business because there was no need to buy new planes if they lasted so long. \n\nThe MD88/90 should be gone by next year. The 717 will be around for a while longer. Just remember that the A220 isn't a MD88/90 replacement. They seat more people than the A220. How Delta retrofits the new Bus, they actually have one seat less than the 717. Funny, eh?\n\nThe A220 will probably be used to supplement the CRJ routes like DTW>JFK, at least until the A220-300 production really picks up, which I've heard will come with ETOPS qualification, so it can fly some decently long routes. \n\nAs for how loud they are, yea there's no getting around that. The JT8D engine was built in the 70s, where noise reduction was probably the last bullet point on the list. That said, it's a beast of an engine that will give you all it's got.

38,Question about flying with an Autistic child,14,dgmczv,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dgmczv/question_about_flying_with_an_autistic_child/,21,1570861812.0,"So we're thinking of visiting Chicago in April and it would be my son's first flight. He'll be almost 6 at the time but he's Autistic. He loves car rides so as long as there's movement he's good. We'd also bring his tablet and lots of snacks. The flight is relatively short as well.

Here's my issue:
JetBlue is usually the preferred airline option for most families with Autism. In our situation I weighed the costs vs pros/cons. My husband and I are both big - he's over 6 feet but we're also heavier. If we did JetBlue we'd have to get very specific flights so the plane was 3x2 or 3x3 so we'd be together, and Economy seats are pretty tight. 

The other option is Delta.

Delta has a Canadair Regional Jet 900 that they use for NYC to Chicago flights. In First Class that's 1x2 seats. 

Taking cost into account I realized the difference between Economy JetBlue and First Class Delta was only $150 difference! Delta would mean significantly more room, less people to possibly disturb, and a flight attendant much closer if we needed anything. I'd also inform the airline ahead of time that he has Autism.

My question is this: has anyone taken a First Class flight with a child? I know I'm paying for a service but I don't want to get nasty looks from other passengers, as that's a real issue when we're out in public. He's pretty well behaved in that it's not like we let him run around screaming and hitting people, but he could potentially get scared during takeoff and landing and he could stim at times.

Is it generally frowned upon to seat a child in First Class? 

Has anyone flown with an Autistic child on Delta? If so, how was your experience, especially if you've also flown JetBlue.","['So let me say, I‚Äôm probably an expert here.  I have a son who‚Äôs 5 who‚Äôs autistic as well. I am also a diamond medallion with delta.  Due to my status when me and him fly we are always in first class.  I‚Äôve only had one issue in all his flights, 50ish, but that was just when we had both boys and it was 10:30 at night and they were a little fussy boarding and I got a couple of looks.  They fell asleep shortly after.  \n\nI usually let the gate agent and flight crew know what‚Äôs going on when we see them and they are just over the top amazing.  \n\nMy son prefers noise canceling headphones, not sure how you do with noise.   \n\nMake sure you get a good photo in the Cockpit as I‚Äôm sure the pilot will welcome him in.  \n\nThe 2x1 FC on the 900 is good.  I‚Äôd probably suggest get the bulkhead seats. \n\nAlso there is Wings For Autism event for those with autism to go through the whole boarding process with TSA and all on Oct 27th in Binghamton NY if that happens to be close \n\nhttps://thearc.org/our-initiatives/travel/\n\n\n\n#teamdelta!', 'The CRJ900 will have a forward lavatory as well.

If you're really concerned, take them some cupcakes or chocolate chip cookies (they don't get much time to eat between flights and love getting snacks) and they'll love you. There are usually two flight attendants on the CRJs."", 'FC in a 900 is not as roomy as the mainline jets.

Amman to Paris (a 5 hour flight) they flew an A320. Per usual on this plane, business class is simply economy seats with middle seat blocked off. Not exactly comfortable when you want to sleep. Further, no IFE, no WiFi. I know we get spoiled with Delta but when you book a D1 ticket you expect a certain level of quality. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the FA‚Äôs are always top notch but even on long haul flights premium economy seats are more like torture devices for your back as they don‚Äôt recline, seats are narrow in economy, and I‚Äôd say at least 50% of the time there‚Äôs something wrong with power or the headphone port. 

The only redeeming quality I can truly find when getting a codeshare with AF are the nice lounges in CDG.

The inside armrests are 'flipped' to the middle so there is definitely more butt room and the pitch is greater- isn't much worse than Delta First Class but sucks worse on a five-hour flight w/o IFE\n\nAll that said, Cranky or not, I'm still with you brother!\n\nI recently flew Euro Biz KLM and  Alitalia .. the two flights on Alitalia were 100% better than what I had expected!

I'm sure they are trying to push everything to either online bookings or their own Delta Vacations.  That's a real shame because these tour operators have been the lifeblood of my business for years and now I can't work with some of the partners I've had for so long now.

I would say Gold is where the benefits start making a difference to your experience, as you get Sky Priority, Skyteam Elite Plus status and same-day standby/confirmed fees waived.', 'I\'ve been silver for each of the past three years. I think there are definite benefits. Are they as good as the benefits that come from gold or above? No, but that\'s to be expected.

I fly out of RDU so, as a Silver, I fairly frequently get Comfort+ and I occasionally get First Class. If you fly out of ATL or another hub as a silver, you probably won\'t get upgraded much as those airports tend to be full of higher level medallions.\n\nI use the exit row seat selection option nearly 100% of the flights I book, so that\'s why I rank it as #1. It just provides the most overall value for me. \n\nThe dedicated number is kind of handy when things go awry but you\'ll still have a pretty significant wait time if there\'s a big weather event. But, it\'s still better than the general number so it\'s worth noting.\n\nThere\'s also the free bag but I almost never check bags so that\'s pretty ""meh"" for me in terms of utility.\n\nTL;DR Silver is definitely better than nothing but clearly not as good as Gold or above.

If the airline provides a means by which you can spend your way to status and the value proposition is favorable, then why not? \n\nAt the end of the day Delta is a business and it is a two-way transaction.

I\'ve had the reserve for about three years now after upgrading from the platinum when I started traveling for work. The first class complimentary companion ticket alone was worth the additional cost, my problem is the fact they targeted the reserve benefits for people who aren\'t frequent fliers.  You would have to be a Delta fanboy/idiot/not care about money to purchase the reserve card and not be a Delta status member. The reserve card alone can get you Gold Medallion status with MQM pumps after spend hits. Gold and above comes with Sky Priority so it\'s not a big deal they removed the sky priority perk. We usually clear diamond by August and I know a bunch of us on this sub are in similar positions.  Why would we care about complimentary upgrades if you don\'t have status? Why is everyone so happy with these changes? Am I missing something? I\'m assuming this is basically saying reserve holders are just below silver medallion. When on Earth was the last time a silver medallion member actually got a seat upgrade? 1 in 100 times?  I can almost guarantee they put this ""perk"" in there as fluff since they removed other pieces. Most of us fliers also have the amex platinum and/or chase sapphire reserve which come with Global Entry and TSA already also included with diamond status. Higher tier medallion members also get skyclub access already and those other travel cards also come with lounge access...so that perk is somewhat of a wash. I eat out almost everyday and they couldn\'t simply add 2x or 3x on restaurants and hotels like the other cards? Maybe add a travel credit like the Amex Platinum Card for incidentals? Maybe 4X or 5X on Delta purchases? Maybe include Hawaii for the companion ticket? Delta should consider a premium card with features that enhance medallion member travel/vacation life. Clearly the Delta Amex Platinum is the winner here.... restaurants and grocery boosts with a companion ticket for way less.

94,Delta reserve card,6,djzfoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/djzfoy/delta_reserve_card/,7,1571491268.0,"Trying to decide if i want it, and need to decide quick because the bonus miles offer ends october...

I probably fly 10 round trips a year and if i got the card i would try to fly strictly delta... Lounge acccess, companion ticket, going forward - unlikely but hopeful complimentary upgrades plus all the little extra benefits with the card. Is it worth it?

FYI, i fly out NYC airports so finding Delta flights to anywhere isnt hard at all

Thoughts?","['I‚Äôve had it for about 7 years. I‚Äôm a consultant that typically flies on average 3 weeks out of the month from my home base of Atlanta. The reasons the hefty annual fee are worth it:\n\n-SkyClub access.  Invaluable to me since I‚Äôm guaranteed to use at least on my outbound trip. Smaller places like Omaha or Norfolk Va obviously don‚Äôt have clubs so if you fly into smaller markets this won‚Äôt be a perk that‚Äôs useful. Since the summer, I‚Äôve thankfully been flying into larger markets where SkyClubs are present. It‚Äôs made flying much more enjoyable especially when departure delays happen (EWR, I‚Äôm looking directly at you üò≥).\n-MQM boost. Since I typically have direct flights and my clients are on the east coast, I can‚Äôt count on segments or mileage to get me much status. This card helps that-a lot.\n-extra opportunities to earn miles on delta through spending esp. if booking directly with Delta.\n\nAs far as the companion certificate, most everyone I know (including me) don‚Äôt ever use it bc of the restrictions it places (class of ticket, availability of eligible flights). Honestly, I accrue miles pretty easily and quickly so my partner and I fly for free using tickets booked with miles several times a years.\n\nAlso, I don‚Äôt see much advantage as far as upgrades go. I‚Äôm Gold currently on the verge of becoming Platinum. But since I fly out of Atlanta where there are sooooo many Diamonds, best I can ever hope for is an occasional bump to C+. I haven‚Äôt been upgraded to first for any flight in I don‚Äôt even remember how long, even when flying very expensive coach fares.\n\nJust note, in January the annual fee is going up to $550 from 450. Don‚Äôt know your destinations to know if these are worth the price of having the card. For me, it makes sense.\n\nHope this helps!', 'If lounge access is what you‚Äôre after, I‚Äôd get the Amex Platinum Card, especially if you fly international. It has many of the same benefits (Global Entry Fee, SkyClub access when flying Delta, etc) but you get 5x points instead of 3x and Amex points rollover 1:1 into SkyMiles. I find Amex points into SkyMiles partners give you a better exchange because their rewards charts can sometimes be much better than Delta. You don‚Äôt have that flexibility with Delta SkyMiles credit cards. If you have a family, the Platinum card and the Priority Pass lounges have a much more liberal guest allowance and the biggest factor is that authorized users on the Amex Platinum card get some of the Amex Platinum benefits while Reserve card benefits only extend to the primary account holder. This is huge. I had to open a Delta Reserve for me and a separate Reserve for my wife ($450/each, so $900 annually) BUT if I would‚Äôve gotten the Amex Platinum card I could‚Äôve added her as an authorized user (and 2 additionals) for $175 making my annual fee with the Amex platinum $725 ($550 + $175) and she gets lounge access and many of the other great benefits that come with the Amex Platinum. Value for money is definitely here if you travel enough. \n\nWhat you haven‚Äôt mentioned is how far you‚Äôre expecting to fly, what level of medallion status you‚Äôre expecting to attain without bonus MQMs, etc. With the recent changes, Delta has made it very clear that the strategy and value proposition for holding the Reserve (and the Delta SkyMiles Platinum to some degree) is reaching a level of status you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise enjoy, getting into only Delta SkyClubs with limited guest access (not the over 1,500 lounges that the Amex network grants you), and helping you get more upgrades by making it a trump card for people of the same medallion status.\n\nWe will be downgrading my wife‚Äôs reserve and I‚Äôll be getting the Amex Platinum and adding her as an authorized user. I‚Äôll probably keep mine as I fly around 20-25 flights and have seen the Reserve card get me to the top of the upgrade list and the MQM bonus will be how I reach Platinum Status so it is certainly worth it to me for those reasons. But I‚Äôll test it out this year and downgrade if I feel it hasn‚Äôt been worth it. \n\nI feel that Delta has yet to make the Reserve card a true top tier travel card that commands the $550 annual fee compared to the Amex Platinum. Way kore value for money with the Amex Platinum and many Delta benefits. If you want the free checked bag and Main 1 boarding just get the gold SkyMiles card and the Amex platinum. All the Delta specific flight benefits (not the status boost), and more lounge access and so much more.', ""It's not a bad card to have. It works well for the right person. I have it because of the companion certificate. It more than covers the annual fee for me. The icing on the cake is Sky Club access. If it weren't for the companion certificate, I would probably ditch the card and find something else.\n\nI have heard some people complain about never being able to find fares that qualify for the companion certificate...so keep that in mind if you live near an airport without a lot of Delta service."", ""The only real benefit of the Reserve card is MQM boosts. There are better cards out there for everything else\n\n1. Lounge Access - Amex platinum is way better because you also get Centurion, American Express and Priority Pass\n2. Travel Rewards - Chase SR/SP have better reward ratios (3x/2x) and so does Amex Plat (5x but more limited).\n3.   Fee Credits - CSR is the best here with (almost) no-questions-asked $300 annual credit and Amex Plat at $200.\n\nI am considering the Reserve for 2020 though because I wouldn't mind the MQM bonuses but the $550 fee starting next year is a bit of a deal-breaker. You just don't get the value you would from the other cards."", 'How can I get this card from Canada?

132,Flew First Class for the First Time Today,44,d1lvb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/d1lvb8/flew_first_class_for_the_first_time_today/,29,1568031064.0,"I started a new job in February where I have to fly from my home airport of GSP to BOS and back once a month, which through Delta usually necessitates a connection in ATL. Before February, I've only flown a handful of times over the years. 

My company's reimbursement policy is for ""the most economical fare class available"" and anything above that comes out of my pocket, but they do reimburse for checked bags. I started out flying Basic Economy, but after a couple of months figured out that Main Cabin was also reimbursed with no issues. 

Last month, the hotel that is recommended by my company was booked up and I found a bundle deal on Expedia for a slightly-less-fancy hotel and Comfort+ that was cheaper than just the normal rate for the recommended hotel. I did the same thing this month, but the bundle included a First Class ticket from GSP-BOS and Comfort+ on the return trip on Friday. Plus, since it was a bundle, I paid for the hotel + airfare weeks ago and have already been reimbursed by my company so there were no issues with my bundle deal making it past the bean counters.

I think I'm ruined for Main Cabin and Comfort+ now. I'm a bigger guy, and having the extra space in First Class where I never touched the person sitting next to me was by-far the best perk. Here's how I rate the rest of the experience. 

Great perks for First Class: 

* All the space. Since only two seats go into a section the width of three seats in C+ and Main Cabin, the seats are wider, there's almost a foot of armrest ""neutral ground"" between the two seats, and there was plenty of legroom. I actively avoid putting my backpack under the seat when possible because it always takes legroom away, but I don't think I would have even noticed it today. The seats also recline further, but I usually don't recline my seat so I didn't test this out.

* Free priority checked bags - I normally just bring a carry-on to avoid extra fees that I sometimes gate check, but this time I checked my carry-on and with the little yellow ""Priority"" tag on bag it was one of the first off the plane. Once I deplaned, went to the bathroom, and made it to the baggage pickup area, my bag was waiting on me. A great experience.

* Drink Service before take-off - It's awesome to get a drink before you take off. Normally, I'm used to grabbing a coffee or soda to bring onto the plane on main cabin, because it can take a while to take off and get to cruising speed, plus another 20+ min for the cart to get to my location, but in First you don't have to think about it. Just show up, board, and get whatever you want within 5-10 min. Awesome. 

* Multiple free drinks - I get a single free drink in C+, but it was nice on my flight from ATL-BOS to get a coffee w/ Baileys, a Bloody Mary, and a Bourbon and Coke Zero. 

* Drink service in first even when the rest of the plane doesn't get a drink service. The short 30-min hop from GSP to ATL never gets a drink service, but I had two coffees with Baileys in first, one pre-flight and another in the air. Awesome. 

* Free meal - I received an email a few days ago asking about my meal preference, and I chose a chicken sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. It came with a fruit plate and Chobani blueberry yogurt. It's no different than any other meal I could have gotten in the airport for $12, but I didn't have to worry about finding a meal before boarding. It was nice to just walk around during my layover without getting into long lines for food while trying to make a connection. 

* Pillow and blanket - first class domestic passengers get a little pillow and a blanket. The pillow made the already-comfortable seat even better. I didn't use the blanket, but it seemed decent. Another advantage of first class - you don't have to plan ahead to bring these things‚Äîjust show up. 

* Flight Attendant attention - the flight attendant for First Class routinely checked to see if any of us needed anything. It felt like being at a nice restaurant rather than having your meal dropped off at a QSR. The attendant on both flights was also much more personable than in my previous non-FC flights.

* 150% mileage - a great bonus. I'm going to hit silver by EOY (I flew a few times on AA and United to figure out which airline to commit to), but this will help out greatly next year when I chase gold. 

Not awesome, but still nice: 

* When my boarding pass was scanned, the flight attended took the time to look at me, saying ""Enjoy your flight, Mr. <Amator>. I've never had that happen before on a flight. 

* Small water bottles waiting on the seat tray. Nice to have early in the morning when I was a bit thirsty and could have an immediate drink. 

* The armrest with built-in cup tray. It was nice to have a place for the drinks to sit without having to extend the table. 

* The table was a fold-out from the armrest and not the standard seat-back tray table. This way, I didn't have to worry about someone leaning back in their seat and spilling my drink. 

* Little niceties like ceramic cups for coffee, cloth napkins, hot towel, and a little tablecloth for the fold out table. 

* Extra pockets in the seat back - gave me a place to park my Kindle and phone while I watched IFE on these flights.

* First class lavatory - I didn't use this on either flight, but first class gets its own lav so you don't have to wait and I've heard the amenities are a bit nicer.

All in all, I feel like FC has ruined me for other seating classes. I'm going to try and book a similar package with FC flights on both legs of the trip in the future. All of the other little perks are really nice, but having the extra space is definitely the best reason for me to fly FC.","['What do you do for a living? ...I only ask  because that was a very detailed and well written post.', ""Great writing.

I also live in SAN, which, as a non-hub city, requires me to split my flying between mostly DL and WN.  

Situation: I am currently Delta Silver and by Nov 15 will be $600 shy of reaching Gold for 2020.  I can bridge the $600 but only by taking two very inconvenient flights: SAN-PDX and SAN-MIA because of timing of work meetings.  All of my flights must be paid via my corporate card, so there's no room for gaming the system (I have the Delta Gold Amex, but my spend is far shy of card spend waiver as well).

Question: Is Gold Medallion that much better than Silver?  With two little kids at home, is it worth that trade-off of time with them versus what I'll get over the course of a year with Gold status?  I expect to fly about the same amount in 2020 as I did this year, so would be on the line of achieving Gold again.  I almost feel silly for asking this, but thought it was worth input from experienced travelers.

Thanks for the advice!","[""In my opinion, there is a big difference between gold and silver as a frequent flyer. The big thing for me was the waived SDS/SDC fee - I didn't think it would be a big difference, but the flexibility to switch fights (even if somewhat restricted) when schedules shift the day of would be worth it for me. I've used it extensively to catch an earlier or later flight when a meeting ends early or runs late.\n\nThe other big change in lounge access on international flights, and priority baggage handing. Having my bag come out first just means less time at the airport."", ""If you're flying out of non-hub cities a lot you will see an improvement in upgrades."", 'Nope.

With the recent changes, I'm considering downgrading to Delta Platinum. I'd like some advice. I've had all the cards before except the Delta Business Platinum, so I'm doubtful any bonus would apply.

I am Diamond medallion with 100% of my flying for pleasure, most of it international. I use the MQD loophole by flying partners. I typically buy business class fares when they are cheap (usually just a little more than coach). I don't rely on the free upgrades for domestic flights. I just buy first class and pay miles until it's coach price. I haven't used the companion certificate in a few years because I typically travel solo.

I hit the $30k spend for the MQM bonus usually in the late summer. I don't ever hit the $60k mark. I might be able to get to $50k (which is the second spend bonus for the platinum), but maybe not. 

I'm disappointed that the bonus miles are now gone on the Reserve and that the Reserve doesn't earn double miles on any categories (other than Delta purchases). But I like the 15k MQMs. 

My Reserve just renewed this week. Does that mean I'm still at the old annual fee? If so, I would probably wait until next year to downgrade.

I do use SkyClubs and don't use a Diamond choice for it. I rely on my business class seat and my Reserve card since the SkyClub entry change.

So my boyfriend and I booked a couple of (ridiculously cheap) award tickets for this coming Christmas/New Years from SRQ--YYC (via JFK). We're both medallion members (I'm Silver, he's Gold). We've already had to pay to select our seats because the flight from JFK--YYC is listed as a WestJet flight/flight number, which I think is weird but I've noticed some posts in this subreddit about it.

Our intial connecting flight from SRQ to JFK is labeled as a DL flight number, but the flight from JFK to Calgary is WJ. The return flight from YYC to ATL is labeled as a WJ flight as well.

I'm flying DTW-SJS round trip for the first time in December, on Delta of course. I'm a window seat guy, so I'm wondering what the best views will be on the way there and back; left or right side of the plane.

Looking at flightradar24, it looks like the flight path scoots somewhat along the Colorado-Wyoming border (of course there will be some deviation, but that's the general idea). I'm guessing I want to be looking south at the Rocky Mountains, which would put me on the left side of the plane on the way there and the right side on the way back.

Anyone agree or disagree? It the view north of South Dakota, Wyoming, and Idaho better than the view south of Colorado and Utah?","['The reason I can think of to sit on the north facing side of the plane is that the sun won\'t be shining directly into your window the whole flight.  Especially in December, the sun will be to the south.  In fact, there\'s some chance you\'d be ""forced"" to close your window on the southward side.  I think I\'d pick the northward side just because of this, regardless of what exact sites will be below each side.', ""Hm, even though this isn't a long haul flight, there's still a shut down period where they darken the plane? That'd be unfortunate because I'd love to look out my window the whole time."", 'No, I don\'t think it would be that official, but if the sun is shining in and making glare on the in flight entertainment screens, your fellow passengers might ""force"" you to close it by complaining to the flight attendant about the glare.  If you\'re on the north side of the plane, I don\'t think you\'d have any issue.\n\nI agree with you, though - all I do on planes is look out the window and take photos of the interesting things I see.  I don\'t like being forced to close my shade.  That\'s why I\'d pick the north side.', 'I‚Äôve never been told to close my window on a domestic flight and I‚Äôve done thousands.\n\nThat said, there really is no good side. Plus there‚Äôs no telling what the cloud cover will be like. The routings can change almost daily too, due to winds and such.

* **Partnership brings together the leading airlines in North America and Latin America, connecting the Americas to the world as never before.**
* **Together, Delta and LATAM will hold the leading position in five of the top six Latin American markets from the U.S.**
* **Together, the partners will serve 435 destinations worldwide and carry more passengers between North America and Latin America than any other partnership.**
* **Customers will benefit from significantly expanded travel choices across the Americas and an industry leading customer experience.**

Delta and LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (‚ÄúLATAM‚Äù) today announced that they have entered into a strategic partnership that for the first time combines the strengths of the leading airlines in North and Latin America.

‚ÄúThis transformative partnership with LATAM will bring together our leading global brands, enabling us to provide the very best service and reliability for travelers to, from and throughout the Americas,‚Äù said Ed Bastian, Delta‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer. ‚ÄúOur people, customers, owners and communities will all benefit from this exciting platform for future growth.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis alliance with Delta strengthens our company and enhances our leadership in Latin America by providing the best connectivity through our highly complementary route networks,‚Äù said Enrique Cueto Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of LATAM. ‚ÄúWe look forward to working alongside one of the world‚Äôs best airlines to enhance the travel experience for our passengers.‚Äù

The strategic partnership will unlock new growth opportunities, building upon Delta‚Äôs and LATAM‚Äôs global footprint and joint ventures worldwide, including Delta‚Äôs existing partnership with Aerom√©xico. With their complementary networks, Delta, LATAM and their partners will be able to offer access to a greatly expanded array of worldwide destinations. Together, the partnership will provide greater customer convenience, a more seamless travel experience and better connect customers with the rest of the world.

Additional details of the partnership include:

* Delta will invest $1.9 billion for a 20 percent stake in LATAM through a public tender offer at $16 per share, to be funded principally with newly issued debt and available cash.
* Delta will also invest $350 million to support the establishment of the strategic partnership.
* Delta will acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and has agreed to assume LATAM‚Äôs commitment to purchase 10 additional A350 aircraft to be delivered beginning in 2020 through 2025, supporting Delta‚Äôs ongoing fleet transformation.
* Delta will be represented on LATAM‚Äôs Board of Directors, further strengthening the relationship.
* The tender offer and the strategic partnership are subject to customary closing conditions and all required governmental and regulatory approvals, including anti-trust immunity.

Delta expects that the transaction will be accretive to EPS over the next two years. In addition, the transaction will not impact the company‚Äôs existing financial commitments to shareholders, including free cash flow and shareholder returns. Delta also expects to remain within targeted leverage ratios.

For LATAM, the transaction will improve free cash flow generation, reduce forecasted debt by over $2 billion by 2025 and improve LATAM‚Äôs capital structure, enhancing its ability to execute its long-term strategy.

Delta will hold a live conference call and webcast to discuss the agreement on Friday, September 27, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

They fly out on Monday morning, back on Friday night. Usually it\'s the same city for months at a time. They spend more time in hotels than they do in their own beds, and don\'t get much variety in what they see and do. Most of those folks seem pretty miserable to me.  \nOn the other hand, I know some people in sales-and-support positions who love it. They go somewhere different every week, meet with clients, do presentations, sales pitches and all that, and they\'re usually gone for 2, maybe 3 nights at a time.\n\nI guess the point of that would be to say that I think the travel can be cool or it can be awful. It depends a lot on the why and how of what you\'re doing. If it\'s frequent but short trips, I think that\'s a good thing, and I think it can actually be good for a relationship. I also think jobs where you can plan your travel well in advance makes it less miserable.\n\nBut I\'d also say it takes a certain \'nomadic\' personality to really enjoy it. No matter how you do it, it\'s hard to maintain friendships or a social circle. For one thing you\'re gone all the time, and for another when you are home you feel like you should spend your spare time with your wife because of all the time you were gone. You always feel like you\'re just a little out of sync with everyone else, which can be both good and bad. And sometimes when you finish one trip you feel like you\'re just reloading for the next one. The time in between gets a little hazy.\n\nLast but not least, I\'d say if you\'re ever looking at one of those jobs that says ""75% (or greater) travel required"" then make absolutely certain during the interview that you get to keep your frequent flyer miles, hotel points, and rental car days. More and more companies are requiring people to book travel through some kind of corporate system, and all the points go back to the company. It\'s bullshit, and takes away (as I said earlier) one of the only things that make this worthwhile - so be on the lookout for that.']"
