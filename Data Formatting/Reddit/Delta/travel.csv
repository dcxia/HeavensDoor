3,Experiences with Delta LAX Shuttle?,1,d2tro2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/d2tro2/experiences_with_delta_lax_shuttle/,4,1568251829.0,"Hi everyone, I’m flying SLC -> LAX -> HND (Tokyo) in November on Delta. These were booked as separate tickets (I know, I know), but I already called Delta and they will check my bags through for me and protect my second flight in case the first one is delayed. 

My layover in LAX is 2.5 hours, which I normally wouldn’t be stressed about. But it turns out the Delta terminals (Terminals 2 and 3) aren’t connected to each other or the International Terminal (aka TBIT or Terminal B) via an airside walkway. There is however an airside Delta shuttle bus that can take you between all three terminals. 

My guess is that I will probably arrive in Terminal 3, and will definitely depart from the International Terminal. This connection will be happening mid-morning. 

My question is: does anyone have recent experiences using this shuttle? How long it takes? According to [this Delta graphic](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/lax/images/destinations/aem-destination/delta_lax_chart_042417_v02_Desktop.jpg), it should take about 45 minutes to travel from Terminal 3 to Terminal B. Is this an accurate estimate on Delta’s part? Are the lines for the shuttle long? 

Thanks!","[""Literally just took it a few days ago! It took me about 10 minutes probably, but there was a lot bigger of a line than there were people there when I was there. Meaning, I'm sure at heavy traffic time it could potentially take up to 45 minutes, which is probably why they warn worst case scenario. I've had to utilize them a few times and I feel like I've averaged about 10m each time. I would just do that first and then hang out in your next flight's terminal. Pretty sure theres sky clubs in them all?"", 'Another option if not hauling lots of baggage. Just walk. LAX is very compact horseshoe shaped. Looks from a map that terminal 3 is adjacent to International.  10 minutes max and breathe in the coastal beach air. .', 'This is exactly what I’m looking for, thanks! I feel pretty good about the 2.5 hour connection now. I sort of hate connecting through LAX but I couldn’t resist the $500 round trip LAX -> HND. \n\nThanks!', 'Doesn’t that mean I would have to re-clear security though? Not too keen on that, although we do have global entry. \n\nBut as someone who used to live in SoCal, I feel you on that coastal beach air!']"
4,Purchasing Air France/KLM vs Delta tickets to Italy,2,cm2mx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/cm2mx1/purchasing_air_franceklm_vs_delta_tickets_to_italy/,16,1564986854.0,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask this.

7,"TPA-->ATL-->AMS-->AAL. First flight by Delta delayed, had to pay for a hotel in ATL.

Want to make sure I'm in the right before I give a customer service representative a hard time. 

My understanding is that the law does not apply for the TPA-->ATL portion of the flight (Delta potentially covering hotel costs, notwithstanding). 

However, the delay meant that the rest of the journey was a mess of delays, too. I missed the connection for ATL-->AMS, so I had to fly ATL-->JFK (Delta). Then I flew JFK-->AMS on KLM (delayed 20 min departing, 1 hour landing). Then I was supposed to fly AMS-->AAL, but missed the connection because of the prior delay, and rerouted AMS-->CPH instead. Then that flight was delayed 1 hour, and arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes late, causing another missed connection in CPH. The final flight didn't get me into AAL until 22:00 on May 4. My original arrival was 17:50 on May 3.

Do I have a claim that is simply being refused by KLM? Or am I just falling between the cracks of this law? I.e., cumulatively, the experience is well within the time constraints of the law, but individually each flight might not be...

Paragraph 1 shall apply on the condition that passengers:\n> \n> (b) have been transferred by an air carrier or tour operator from the flight for which they held a reservation to another flight, irrespective of the reason.\n\nAt some point OP was sitting in JFK with a valid ticket on an EU airline flying into the EU.

However when I search for flights (and I know the flight from WJ is going that day) I only see the Delta flights. I know because the WJ flight is non-stop and the Delta flights of course have to stop in ATL for some illogical reason. Anyway, sorting by transit time I see no flights under 4 hours and the WJ flight is 2 hrs, so it's not showing up.

Is there anything special I have to do to see this flight? Am I going to have to call Delta?","[""Supposedly Westjet availability should show up on the Delta site, so if it's not showing there probably isn't award availability.

One location only has non-stop service on one day. Absolutely ridiculous, a 2 hr flight there and a 4 hour or more flight back. There needs to be a carrier that only does non-stop international service. I'd fly with them.\n\nI don't know if i'm going to stay with Delta, limited options for non-stop international travel. Good news is that if I choose this trip I just found, I'll get my completely point funded vacation and i'll be virtually out of Delta points."", ""> They could easily notate that airlines may not have award availability.\n\nIs that not obvious? It's not specific to WestJet. For most airlines, availability of a seat for purchase does not necessarily availability for awards.\n\n> There needs to be a carrier that only does non-stop international service\n\nSounds like the problem is you are in a second-tier city that isn't a hub for any airline.

I just want to go and not have to add hours onto my flight to get somewhere. No worry though, i'll still be able to go on my rewards only trip it looks like.

Here is a tweet I have shared at Delta.

[https://twitter.com/343Postums/status/1117137325807423489](https://twitter.com/343Postums/status/1117137325807423489)

About 24 hours ago in Thailand, my nephew who is 4 years old was hit by a motorcycle on a family vacation.. He has been trying to work with Delta to get home with his family and children. Rather than accommodate him and his family, they are trying to price gouge my brother for a medical emergency where my nephew needs two seats in first class to keep his leg elevated to travel back to the US to see a pediatric orthopedic surgeon.

Delta has done horrible things in the past - but this is fucking unreal to me. If you can, please retweet this and share in an effort to make Delta show some compassion for this issue. Policy change is needed from within for medical emergencies. Trying to make a buck on a customer who medically needs a seat is unacceptable. My brother and I are dumbfounded over this situation and just want to get him and his family home so he can save his sons leg and his life.. 

Absolutely unreal. 6.2k apparently is Delta's assessed value of saving a child's leg and possibly their life.

Cheers,

Tyler Davis","['This is something for their travel insurance to cover, not the airline.

If you were ticketed on Delta, they would waive any penalties and allow you to use the value of your ticket for emergency travel. No Airline comps flights, let alone $5K biz class seats, for medical situations. Delta flies to Rochester, Minnesota too, home of the Mayo clinc.

Have him operated on there.', 'For those saying why blame Delta.\n\nWithin the first few hours of this happening, my brother took him immediately to a hospital to stabilize the leg, contact a pediatric orthopedic surgeon in the US, and Delta to arrange a flight. They were going to re-schedule them to be put onto a flight that day. However, due to what is known as [compartment syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome) being a high risk, they had to wait I believe 4 hours and not be able to commit to the flight.\n\nThey then found a flight with a partner airline and rushed to the airport. However when they got there - Delta was seeing that they could only move 1 person to the flight while the partner airline told them that they had 10 slots available including a seat that would allow for their legs to be raised. So after carrying him through the airport bouncing him with each step and re-introducing the agonizing pain of having a couple broken leg bones because they had to check the stroller and no transport to where they were needed was available - they were turned away at the gate to have to undergo this process again.\n\nBut Delta was at fault here.\n\nDue to this, they are sitting in a hotel in Phuket waiting for a flight to Singapore and then onto the US to then be rushed to a childrens hospital to have surgery performed so he HOPEFULLY doesn\'t have massive nerve damage or issues that come from complications of untreated fractures.\n\nNo offense to Thailand as I\'m sure there are lots of great medical personnel and surgeons there. Personally, I would not go to a local hospital with a general surgeon to have my infant\'s leg treated which was the only option they were given and instead too would wait for a specialized surgeon to give my child the best chance to walk again.\n\nIt seems that the people in this thread think the only realistic option here you see is, ""you should have had travel insurance to cover that."" Which just saddens me.\n\nI guess I work for a company that does more for people and helps and cares. Our culture and one I think everyone should embrace is to lend a helping hand to someone in need. \n\nFollowing the logic of they don\'t have to, they bump soldiers to first class who have no medical reason that is a need to do so - but a child, a 5 year old boy, who was hit by a motorcycle and in agonizing pain, they shouldn\'t have the empathy to offer a family in a horrible situation the opportunity to not suffer or endanger his life. And I KNOW FOR A FACT - if you had a soldier who saw the need for a family and their child who needed a seat - they would gladly give it up. \n\nBut hey, I\'m just a ""greedy"" person apparently who thinks the way this is being handled is completely asinine by Delta.', 'Hey jippiejee,\n\nIt\'s unfortunate that this is the first thoughts in response to this.\n\nIt\'s unfortunate that this is ""the right way"" in today\'s world to deal with things of this nature for so many. \n\nI guess it might be because I\'m from a simple town with friendly neighbors and was raised to lend a helping hand to those in need. I\'m not a person of faith by any means, but the lessons I learned to love thy neighbor and help those in need runs through the fabric of my being.\n\nI\'m thinking of this from a compassionate point of view and one filled with empathy for a situation. My brother has been forced into a horrible situation of where he saw his son nearly killed after being hit by a motorcycle. In the past day he has scrambled to move his flights up and try to acquire 2 first class seats: 1 in order to properly elevate his sons leg and the other for him or his wife to stay with and monitor him on a flight.\n\nThank GOD they are both in the medical field and can handle this situation.\n\nIf they weren\'t - I don\'t even want to know what the average person would do in such a situation. Luckily as well, my brother is able to afford to purchase the upgraded seats to come back to America and not increase the risk of his son losing his leg.\n\n**This is not a plea for money, a plea for reimbursement, or anything of that nature. This is a plea for compassion in our world today of how to better handle things and remember that we are all human beings and should work together to improve how we interact and have processes to support each other.**\n\nI understand your solution points first at defending the airline and focuses directly on the, ""They shouldn\'t cover it, that\'s travel insurance."" Which is a fair point of view and probably follows the proper channels and current system for how ""it works"" in travel. I guess my mind works a bit differently on this sort of a thing. \n\nRather then take an forcibly say ""you need to pay tons of money to get a seat and we are unwilling to bump anyone to accommodate a medical emergency"" the path chosen for a paying customer is to look at it merely from a numbers perspective and force payment.\n\nThe good person in me would want to take such a situation and accommodate a single passenger and a son without a cost falling onto them regardless. Yes it hurts the bottom line, and yes it will lose a bit of profits, but in my mind - if I had a business that has massive profit margins, I can to lose a little bit on a couple of seats to ensure a child has a reduced risk of being able to get to an orthopedic surgeon with the least possible risk of damaging an already injured limb or possible death from complications of an open fracture of multiple bones leaking bone marrow and other bodily fluids into their blood stream.\n\nMy brother\'s son needs to have his leg raised to reduce swelling, risk of clotting, and likely other potential medical complications. **But rather than accommodate them in a medical emergency the first thought is ""how can we profit on this"" and ""this should be travel insurance to cover and not the airline.""**\n\nThere was a flight previously he could have been on, but they refused to accommodate. Then beyond that, have wanted to charge what are likely standard fees in a non-standard and extreme situation.\n\nIt\'s that mindset to me that just makes me sad where we as a species still are. Working for and always driving for the almighty buck. It\'s truly sad that a corporation built up of people - the people aren\'t okay with saying, ""this is wrong"" and instead put the almighty buck ahead of empathy.\n\nCheers,\n\nTyler Davis', 'Yeah, it’s odd to me that the seats need to be in first class.

I just recently went to Brazil for almost a month and the last time I went before that was 3 years ago. I’m about to finish high school and I live in the USA. I had a great time with my family and friends but it’s difficult for me in the USA because here I only have my mother (father divorced and passed away a couple years ago) no other family. We aren’t very rich but we are not very poor so buying a ticket normally isn’t easy it takes a lot of working and planning.

My cousin works with Delta airlines and she said I could get a boarding pass and something with standby travel. I pay $500 and I wait for the plane to fill and they fill the seats. I feel bad for trying to ask her about it because she isn’t really nice and I cannot find information about it. I plan on traveling in 4 months the day after my graduation. If this $500 back and forth ticket is real this is really good for me because I can see my family a lot more and it won’t costs too much. 

In the USA I often feel anxious and depressed because of the fact I don’t have a family here. Yes I have my mom and she is my life but I need other family too. I go to a therapist and that usually helps for a couple days but being with family I had no issues. 

Does anyone have any idea about this whole $500 pass I don’t know if it’s a delta thing or any airline but I’m desperate to understand I know it’s in a LONG time but I wanna know if it’s real or false hope.

I'm going to visit Vietnam for two weeks next month and instead of trying to fit everything in, I figure I'll probably stick to south & central Vietnam and visit north Vietnam properly next trip. Budget isn't too much of an issue as long as it's not spending 500€ on a cave expedition, etc. This is my first visit to Asia so I'll be pretty flexible with my budget in order to soak up as much as I can.

I'll be coming into HCMC and spending a few days there (probably 2 upon arrival and the 1-2 when I go back there to leave). All in all, that leaves me about 10 days the explore the rest. As of now, my only *must* is Hoi An and maybe Dalat. 

I'm not a party person; I mainly want to see some lovely scenery, explore gorgeous landscapes, and do some fun activities I wouldn't have the opportunity to do back home. I've been looking at national parks and have seen a few and was looking for general feedback from people who've visited them. 

Cat Tien seems like the most obvious choice, then there are others like Bach Ma, Bidoup Nui Ba, Yok Don, Nui Chua... 

And I know Phong Nha is probably at the top of the list but again, I doubt I'll have the time to navigate the entire country in two weeks so I'll leave that one for another trip.

27,Just got back from an amazing honeymoon in Italy and Greece! Full recap and details.,19,dcicea,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/dcicea/just_got_back_from_an_amazing_honeymoon_in_italy/,14,1570086948.0,"I posted this over in r/weddingplanning, but I figured you folks might appreciate it also. This was my second international trip and my husband's first. We got to do a lot in 11 days (12 days counting travel time), so I hope this recap is helpful to someone planning a similar trip! I wrote a whole lot below, so I tried to highlight the things I really liked in **bold.**

**BUDGET: \~$5,000**

We booked as much as possible in advance: flights, hotels, train tickets, tour tickets, etc. When all was said and done, we spent about $4,200 booking everything. Then all we had to pay on the actual honeymoon was minor daily expenses like food and a couple of taxi rides. All in all, I think we came in right around $5k.

**ITINERARY**

9/14: Wedding day! We live in Florida but wedding was in New York.

9/16: Overnight flight from NY to Venice, Italy

9/17: Arrive in Venice, stay 1 night

9/18: Venice to Florence, stay 2 nights

9/20: Florence to Rome, stay 2 nights

9/22: Rome to Santorini, stay 2 nights

9/24: Santorini to Mykonos, stay 2 nights

9/26: Mykonos to Athens, stay 1 night

9/27: Fly home, Athens to NY

**DAILY RECAP**

**9/17, Venice:** We took an overnight flight, so we arrived in Venice at about 11 a.m. We took a small boat from the airport to the actual city. We were able to check into our hotel and our room was ready early, which was nice, and we were staying right next to the **Rialto Bridge** which is a great area. We dropped our things off and went to walk around a bit and grab lunch. Venice is unlike any city I've ever seen. It's all narrow alleyways and water! Getting around can get kind of confusing, but it's also really fun. After lunch we went back to the hotel for a much-needed nap. That night we went for a **Gondola ride**, which is pricey but worth it for the experience. We then went to a wine bar for some amazing wine and light snacks, then grabbed pizza (also amazing) on the way back to the hotel. We passed out hard from exhaustion!

**9/18, Venice and Florence:** We got up fairly early to grab coffee and a croissant at a nearby bakery. Then we went to **Saint Mark's Basilica** and Doge's Palace. We went inside St. Mark's and it was absolutely stunning. We did not care to pay the entrance fee to Doge's, so we just looked from the outside. Then we went to the local Da Vinci Museum. It's very small, but was interesting. We had more pizza for lunch at a place called **Rossopomodoro** and it was great. Then we caught the 2pm train to Florence. The ride was about 2 hours. In Florence, we checked into our hotel (**Hotel Monna Lisa** \- highly recommend!) and relaxed a bit. That evening we went to the **Mercato Centrale** in Florence, a huge food hall with tons of amazing food and wine. We ate way too much, then checked out a couple of local bars. It was an amazing evening!

**9/19, Florence:** Morning coffee and pastry at a local bakery. Then we headed out for the day, first visiting the **Statue of David**, which was amazing to see in person. Then we walked to the **Piazzale Micelangelo**, which is about a 30 minute walk outside the city but so worth it. It's a huge plaza overlooking all of Florence, and the view is amazing! We then walked back into Florence and visited the Duomo. We hadn't bought tickets in advance, which it turns out is required to schedule a time to actually go in the dome. But we did get to climb the bell tower and had an amazing view from there. We got sandwiches for lunch from the nearby **Panini Toscani**. We were pretty exhausted from the walking and climbing, so we went back to the hotel and napped a bit. That evening, we had a glass of wine in the hotel garden, then headed out to our dinner reservations at **La Bottega Del Buon Caffe**. This was an absolute highlight of the trip! It's a Michelin-starred restaurant and it was absolutely incredible. We then went for drinks at nearby **Rasputin**, a gothic-themed ""secret bar"" which was really neat. Unfortunately, we were really tired and full of food and didn't have the energy to stay very long, but the one drink I had was good.

**9/20,** **Florence and Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then headed out to grab lunch at a small pizza shop, **Gustarium,** which was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD. Then we headed to the train station for our 1pm train to Rome. We had a hiccup here which was that we had planned to take the bus to the train station (we had taken the local bus to the restaurant the night before and it was so easy!) but at this time all of the busses were completely full. We couldn't get on a bus and were risking missing our train so we ended up walking the \~20 minutes to the station with our huge backpacks, which wasn't too fun. But we made it! It was about an hour and a half to Rome, where we took a cab to our Airbnb. We put down our stuff and then immediately headed out to grab an early ""dinner"" at **Sfiziarte** \- a casual sit-down eatery near the vatican. Food was so good! We then headed to Vatican City. Going here was a lifelong dream of mine and it did not disappoint. We saw St. Peter's Basilica, though we did not go inside. Then we headed to the **Vatican Museum** at 5pm for a **night tour** of the museum. They do these on Friday nights and it was SO worth it. Our tour guide was amazing and the museums are way less crowded at night. We saw and learned so much, with the tour ending in the **Sistine Chapel**! We then checked out a few bars in the area before heading back to the BnB.

**9/21, Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then went to lunch at **Alfredo Alla Scrofa,** which is the birthplace of fettuccine alfredo! It was great and also happened to be right by our Airbnb. Then we did a 3 hour guided tour of the colosseum and ancient Rome. The sights were amazing and we learned a lot, but 3 hours was a bit long in my opinion. We grabbed a snack at another great pizza place, **Pizza e Mozzarella**, then headed over to a different area of Rome where we planned to go to dinner at a popular restaurant called Tonnarello. Unfortunately there was a huge wait for dinner and we ended up going to another restaurant in the area, **Otello**, which also ended up being amazing! There were also a ton of small bars in this area with great specials, so we hung out there until we needed to go back and get some sleep.

**9/22, Rome and Santorini:** We headed to the airport first thing in the morning for our flights to Athens and then Santorini (there are no direct flights to the greek islands). We arrived in Santorini at around 4pm. We had been really excited to go here because we splurged on a honeymoon suite at our hotel (**Aeolos Studios**) and wow, it did not disappoint. We had a balcony with a jacuzzi overlooking the volcano. It was incredible! We had an amazing dinner at nearby restaurant **Aktaion,** then went to **MoMix**, a molecular mixology bar with fun and interesting drinks. We were tired from traveling so we didn't stay out too late.

**9/23, Santorini:** This was one of the busiest days of our trip because there was so much we wanted to do! We had lunch at a restaurant called Avocado, which was very highly reviewed but I thought was just okay (I just got a salad though so maybe that's why). Then we headed down to the Old Port of Santorini to go on a **volcano hot springs cruise**. Getting to the old port is no easy feat, as you have to climb down 587 stairs to reach it! There is also a cable car that can take you down, but the line was incredibly long so we chose the stairs. It was exhausting but a pretty cool experience. The cruise itself was amazing! We hiked the volcano (which still has an active crater, seeing the sulfer was so cool), and then got in the water at a nearby hot spring. We got back around 5:30 very tired and dirty, raced back to our hotel to change (we took the cable car back up thank goodness), and then left again for dinner. We had another incredible dinner with a view at **Argo.** After dinner we stopped at a romantic bar on the way back to our hotel, **Mylos**, for a nice drink with another great view.

**9/24, Santorini and Mykonos:** We woke up and the weather was awful! We'd had breakfast plans, but it was so foggy and rainy outside we didn't feel like leaving the hotel, so we just got room service. At noon we had to head to the port (different port from yesterday) to take our ferry over to Mykonos. We actually got very lucky because there was a ferry strike on this day and most ferries were cancelled, but for some reason ours wasn't! It was very stressful waiting to find out. We arrived in Mykonos and checked into our hotel, where we rested for a while. Then we went into the main area of Mykonos for dinner and drinks. We had heard a lot about the nightlife in Mykonos and wanted to experience it, and we certainly did! We went to a few places, but my favorites were **Alley Cafe** (which is actually just a bar) and **Skandinavian Bar**, which is a dance club. We both definitely had too much to drink and neither of us really remember getting back to the hotel, so maybe that wasn't too smart. But we had a blast dancing the night away! It was definitely the party night of the trip.

**9/25, Mykonos:** I woke up regretting my decisions the night before, as I was pretty hungover and couldn't get out of bed for several hours. We did manage to get up in the early afternoon and take a bus down to Paradise Beach, where we had lunch at a great restaurant, **Indian Palace**. We went to the beach but not for too long, then we took the bus back to Mykonos Town. I almost threw up on the bus due to being hungover so it wasn't great. We rested a bit more at the hotel, then went to **Karavaki Restaurant** for dinner. The restaurant is on top of a huge hill and has an amazing view, though it was a bit of a hike to get there! We went to bed super early due to our early flight the next morning.

**9/26, Mykonos and Athens:** We had a 6:40 a.m. flight out of Mykonos, so we were up by 4 a.m. It was tough but it ended up being worth it to have the whole day in Athens! We got into Athens by 7:30 a.m. and went to our hotel **(Palladian Home)**. They were able to have our room ready within the hour, which was great because we got to take a morning nap. Around noon we went out for a **3 hour guided tour of the Acropolis** and the related museum. I have always loved ancient Greece, so this was an incredible experience, although similar to the last tour I felt like 3 hours was a little too long and it dragged on at times. But we still loved it! I was singing Hercules songs all day, lol. That night, we decided to check out two bars that are on the World's 50 Best Bars List, **The Clumsies** and **Baba au Rum**. Both bars were incredible and it was a great end to our trip!

**9/27, Athens and New York:** We headed straight to the airport in the morning for a flight out at 9:25 a.m. The 10.5 hour flight home was pretty miserable (two hours longer than the flight on the way there), and I'm still adjusting from the jet lag, but it was so worth it!

**WHAT I LOVED**

The whole trip was easily the best trip of my life, and my husband agreed! I loved pretty much every second of it, but these are the things that really made it great:

* The itinerary - I was a bit nervous about hopping cities every 1-2 days, but it actually worked out great. We got to see a million things, but it was also never too stressful, as we found plenty of time to just relax and rest. I might make one change (noted below), but otherwise I think it was the perfect mix of relaxation and sightseeing.
* The prices, especially in Italy - we were so pleasantly surprised by how affordable everything was! You could find a big glass of wine for 3 euro pretty much anywhere in Italy, maybe 4 euro in Greece. Entrees which would cost $15-20 in America were generally under 10 euro. The islands were a bit more expensive, which makes sense. It was nice to enjoy all these restaurants and bars without feeling too guilty about our budget.
* The food! Not much to say here, just the food in both countries was absolutely incredible, so much fresher and more flavorful than what you find 90% of the time in America.
* Silly shirts - we got a bunch of those cheesy honeymoon couples shirts, regular Mr. and Mrs. ones as well as nerdy themed ones, and we had so much fun wearing them. I know it's not everyone's jam, but we figured this was the one time to ham it up. Plus, plenty of people noticed and offered us congratulations, and we got a free bottle of wine at 3 of our hotels!
* They honeymoon suite - we kept our accommodations pretty modest for most of the trip, but the honeymoon suite we splurged on in Santorini was so worth it. We relaxed in our balcony jacuzzi both nights overlooking an incredible view. Santorini itself was the most beautiful place I have ever seen and was just an overall highlight of the trip.
* Dinner at Bottega in Florence - I mentioned in the daily recap, but this was another splurge that was totally worth it. Neither of us had dined at a Michelin restaurant before and we were just completely blown away. It was the best meal of my life!

**WHAT I MIGHT DO DIFFERENTLY**

There are very few things I would change, but here are a couple of things that might have made the trip even better:

* Mykonos - If I could do it again, I'm not sure I would include the two nights in Mykonos in the itinerary. Instead, we could have stayed for an extra night in Santorini and then done two nights in Athens instead of one. It would have saved us money and time on the ferry ride to Mykonos, plus it would have given us more time in those two cities that I liked a little better. Mykonos was fun (definitely had the most straight-up fun night of the trip there), but it's not terribly different from Santorini and I'm not sure it was worth the trouble to go to two islands.
* Guided tours - We loved the night tour of the Vatican and I would definitely do that one again! As to the other two tours (colosseum and acropolis), I'm torn. We did learn a lot, but it was too much information at times and it got a little bit tedious. I would do maybe a 2 hour tour, but not a 3 hour again.
* Norwegian flight - we flew on the way there with Delta, but our flight home was through Norwegian. We got it VERY cheap and I guess you do get what you pay for. Apparently Norwegian is having huge financial issues right now, so they're leasing out their flights to another company, Hi-Fly. The plane was easily from the 1990s and had none of the features that our Delta flight had. There was a screen on the back of the seat but it only played a movie at the beginning of the flight and the audio didn't work. Then we got the audio working but it didn't play any more movies. On a 10.5 hour flight! There were no outlets or anything, and my millenial ass didn't bring a physical book to read, just a kindle which died. My headphones (wireless), also died. So there was nothing to do on this 10.5 hour flight except try to sleep, which didn't happen because it was a daytime flight and we were located next to the bathroom so I was hearing A TOILET FLUSHING EVERY 30 SECONDS. We both nearly went stir crazy by the last couple of hours. Sorry, that was a bit of a rant, and a very first world problem, but seriously - I would pay for a better flight next time.

**CONCLUSION**

I hope this was a little bit helpful for someone! I know I wrote quite a lot, but I hope I conveyed how seriously amazing every day of the trip was. We're so sad that it's over but we're already planning our next international trip! I would HIGHLY recommend this itinerary for anyone considering it for their honeymoon or just a getaway. It was truly magical.","['Nice write-up, thanks for taking the time.

I'm paying around $340 roundtrip from LAX, which I think is pretty damn good.

40,Question about compensation resulting from recent trip to Barcelona?,0,dj74uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/dj74uf/question_about_compensation_resulting_from_recent/,5,1571351203.0,"My family and I recently went on a trip to Barcelona, and the date of our departure was the day of the mass protests (October 15th). For this return trip, our flight was scheduled to leave at 6:20 am from Barcelona to Amsterdam, and then we were supposed to fly back to Chicago. These flights were all purchased on Delta, and the return was operated by KLM. We did buy the optional trip coverage plan provided by Delta. 

Once our flight was cancelled, we talked to a KLM gate agent who rebooked us on another flight out of Barcelona operated by Aer Lingus that flew out around 11 am to Dublin. We then took a united flight back to Chicago and ended up only being a few hours late from our estimated arrival time. 

Unfortunately, on the return trip, one of our bags was lost. A United employee says it possibly never left Barcelona, but they seem to be unable to find the bag. My question is who should I contact about compensation for this bag. Should it be Delta who I originally booked the flight, KLM who operated the original flight, Aer Lingus who forced us to check the bag (too big for their carry on size, even though it was fine for Delta carry on), or United?

Additionally, I have heard the EU has excellent compensation for cancelled flights. Would these apply for our situation where the airport was shut down due to protestors?

Thanks for all the help!","['If you checked in your bag with Air Lingus, they should be responsible for it.', 'In this case United would be responsible for the lost baggage since it was the last carrier on the return part.

Would these apply for our situation where the airport was shut down due to protestors?\n\nNo it's unlikely as these was circumstances outside of the airline''s control. Compensation doesn't cover eg. ATC strikes, powergrid failure, security shutdowns, weather. It does cover you for - although you might have to fight the airlines on this - technical faults with the plane, not enough airline crew to fly, airline staff on strike, knock on delays due to other incidents, and basically anything that is or should have been within the airline's control. In which case you'd receive up to €600 per passenger, depending on how many hours after the original schedule you touched down in Chicago. Your travel insurance might still pay out though - check your policy.\n\nEarlier this year my Wizz Air flight from Eilat to London was delayed by about 12 hours. I was so hoping it was due to a broken left falangey, which would mean €600 on a €40 flight!

Although it was a stressful day, the overall time of my airfare did not increase, so I think I was quite lucky.

It [explicitly tells you the fare is now $1091.79](http://i.imgur.com/F1chyGa.png) due to ""high demand"".\n\nLike it is mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/532277/deltacom_unethically_increases_price_by_10_after/d7pbfbg), it is likely due to the fare bucket structure (X seats left) but with the main page/search page not up to date nor reflecting latest bucket\'s price. \n\n[If OP followed up with this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/532277/deltacom_unethically_increases_price_by_10_after/d7pegbj), it will explain *everything*.\n\nI understand it\'s very very suspicious that you see the $991.79 price when searching again *after* purchasing at $1091.79. But like you said, if you try to purchase again, it jumps up to $1091.79 *again* tells me that:\n\n* the real price is indeed 1091.79 for the (currently) cheapest fare class\n\n* the search/select itinerary and main pages are **not updated** to reflect the selling-out of the lower fare class pricing at $991.79\n\n* the fare classes (V) and (L) selected in the first screen *are no longer the cheapest fares* but the search results are still showing **cached results**', 'Oh give me a fucking break. I am the farthest from a DL fanboy (I haven\'t flown them in 20 years, and have constantly ripped on their repeated SkyPe$os devaluations), but this rhetoric is just ridiculous.\n\nFares aren\'t locked in until you actually buy them, and demand fluctuates constantly.\n\nThis post shows a profound lack of understanding of how fares are structured. That, in itself, is no crime at all, and if the rhetoric was more interrogatory (""why did this happen?"") and less accusatory, then I\'d be a lot more pleasant about the whole thing.\n\nEvery flight has different fare ""buckets"", which have a finite number of seats. You\'d see this represented on a GDS like this:\n\nF7 A7 P3 J7 C6 I4 Y7 B7 H7 M7 W7 V7 G5 N5 O3 S2 Q0\n\nThis is a descending (more or less, and I\'m using AA fare buckets [more or less]) fare structure from highest (F is an unrestricted first class fare) and Q is the lowest (most restrictive) coach fare. In this example, the number 7 represents *at least* 7 seats remaining in that fare bucket. Some airlines will show 4, some will show 7, and some will show 9. If it shows 7, it could be 7 or 107. Only the airline will know for sure.\n\nThey don\'t exist independently from one another. If one fare bucket sells out, the lowest price automatically becomes the next fare bucket. That usually comes with a price increase. So it doesn\'t matter how many seats are left on the plane, on my example, when Q sells out, S becomes the cheapest. You\'ll notice there are still plenty of the full fare (completely transferable, refundable, changeable) Y fares left, and there will be until the very end. Those will be the last fares to go, because they\'re the most expensive (often well over $1000 one way domestically) coach fares around (often many times more expensive than discounted (read: restricted) first or business class.\n\nAlmost assuredly what happened is either A) someone bought the last remaining seats in a particular fare bucket between the initial search and the final payment (a reprice could be triggered during any new page load, but often won\'t happen until the final pricing page), or B) the system hadn\'t yet updated the pricing to reflect current fare availability. Both are frustrating, but the farthest thing from unethical or extortion. The fact that the fare went up exactly $100 lends a lot of credibility to a fare bucket being zeroed out and being autopriced into the next fare bucket. \n\nIt\'s also worth noting that there are advance purchase requirements, too, even within the same fare bucket. There are Q fares that have 21-day advance purchase requirements, 14-day, 7-day, 3-day, and 0-day. Even with plenty of availability in a given fare bucket, you get inside 21 days, chances are the prices are going to shift up by $X. Some fare buckets may not have a 21-day advance purchase at all, so you might not see that particular fare bucket price change until 14 days.\n\nLastly, there is only a very rough relationship between the number of seats available for booking and the seat map. There are so, so many reasons why someone would not be able to reserve a seat they\'ve booked (codeshare partner, group travel, only paid seats left are just some possible reasons, and I\'m not saying all are applicable here). A seat map is not a great tool to use to gauge demand or seat availability. Full stop.\n\nI\'m really not trying to be a dick here, but don\'t cry wolf until you actually understand what\'s happening behind the scenes. For people like myself who book lots and lots of flights each year, this is a ""normal,"" albeit somewhat infrequent, and frustrating occurrence. It doesn\'t even remotely fit the definition of extortion.', ""Your headline makes it seem like they jacked the price and charged your card the higher rate after you approved the expected rate.\n\nInstead, they told you about the increase before they charged your credit card.

When that system tried to actually issue the ticket, using Delta's actual, ancient ticketing system, it responded that that fare class was sold out and so offered the next cheapest fare.\n\nIt sucks, but honestly, if DL was doing this as a matter of course, you wouldn't be the first and only person talking about it, believe me."", 'Delta tried to pull the same bullshit with me on a flight from mtl-rdu.

**- Preferably not Europe (i've visited the EU at least three separate occasions already) but if its a destination you feel strongly about we'll consider it.**

**- Some place with decent public transport land, sea or air. We don't want to rent a car.**

**- Two people (i'm 25 and my mother is 53, average fitness) and we're minorities so no places with high rates of crime, xenophobia or racism (please think about this from our perspective)**

52,Delta Premium + vs Lufthansa,2,9u4gaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9u4gaf/delta_premium_vs_lufthansa/,13,1541376269.0,"Hey peoples. 

I was wondering if you could help me out with your personal preference on this.  If this is the wrong place to ask, kindly let me know who I could ask for this. 

I fly to Europe (from USA) about twice a year for work. Typically I always fly Lufthansa Premium. I have had a great track record with them ( only 1 issue). I find the reclining seats great, plus the Leg rest is incredible. 

Recently I was booking my flight and I now see that Delta has a Premium + option available, that wasn't previously available.   Our budget is $3k / flight, so First Class is out of reach (without me forking money out of my pocket to get it), However Premium + is within reach (about $2,500 round trip). 

I can tell from the Delta website that it is about the same as Lufstansa. 

My variables are the following. 

• Domestically I always fly Delta. My city is a hub, so I get direct flights to where I need to go. This means I am part of the Frequent Flyer program. 

• The Delta flight looks to only be upgraded from my City to Amsterdam. From Amsterdam onward it is a 1-2 hour standard flight. This means about 4 ours total of flying with cramped legs (i am tall with bad knees). 


","[""Apples to apples, Lufthansa premium economy is better than Delta. Unless the routing or scheduling is significantly better on Delta, I wouldn't consider it. Since it sounds like it's *worse* (connection in AMS vs direct on LH?) it would definitely be off the table, even given your loyalty to Delta.\n\nfwiw though, depending on dates and the exact route, I'm pretty surprised you can't fly business class with that budget."", ""I'd stick with Lufthansa, considering both options look pretty similar. The only plus point I can see is that you'll get more flyer points, but I'm not sure if compromising and having that cramped onward standard flight – which you'll probably hate if you're tall with knee issues – is worth the sacrifice.\n\nLikewise, I've rarely had any issues with Lufthansa and would fly with them constantly if I could."", 'If you want to collect frequent flier miles and have loyalty I would opt for Delta. Personally I am a big fan of Lufthansa but I live in a united hub and fly Star Alliance as much as possible. \n\nIs Lufthansa direct? If not, are the layover times about the same?', ""If it's an option and you're able to plan ahead, you may try booking round trips originating in Europe (e.g. BUD - ATL - BUD). That should easily give you biz for less than 3k on pretty much every airline. "", 'Just an FYI that if you are diamond or platinum on Delta, you can use the GUCs and RUCs to upgrade the connections on KLM/AF. ', 'Thanks for the advice! (seriously). \n\nThe date I am flying kind of screws that up for me (first week of January).\n\nFrom what I can tell by the websites. \n\nLufthansa Business is about 4.5-5k\nDelta One is about 6K (without taxes). \n\nLufthansa Premium Economy & Delta Comfort + is just shy of 3K.\n', ""Thank you for the response. \n\nI believe you're right, it might just  be  best to stick to the known working route. "", 'Sadly from my city there is no direct flights to Budapest. \n\nTypically I would have to connect through Toronto to get a direct flight. Layover is typically Amsterdam (which I do not mind). \n\n', ""Are those the only two airlines you're looking at? There are almost definitely lower fares with other airlines that'll have fairly comparable routing to Delta. Depending on the airline, business may or may not actually be a big improvement over LH premium econ (especially if that's direct), but seems worth a look."", 'Amsterdam and FRA and MUC are all excellent airports for connections. it’s a matter of personal preference if you want to accumulate some points. If you don’t care about points I would opt for Lufthansa esp if the connection is in MUC (One of my favorite airports in Europe) ', '[deleted]', 'AMS is better than FRA for connections IMHO.', 'Gimme dates and cities (ATL>BUD?) and I can look for you too, but in general you should check something like Google Flights vs just going to every airline website you can think of.', 'I will PM you.

59,Victoria Falls & Southern Africa Safari,1,d52v7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/d52v7q/victoria_falls_southern_africa_safari/,7,1568679197.0,"I’m looking for some advice and feedback on a southern Africa trip that I am planning for my wife and I. This is likely for the summer or fall of 2020, so there’s plenty of time, and nothing is booked yet.

My top two—and, really, only—priorities for this trip are visiting Victoria Falls and going on a great African wilderness safari. We’ve never done either before. I think Victoria Falls is pretty straightforward, but I’m struggling with the safari part. There must be upwards of a hundred safari lodges, camps, and/or trips, in maybe a dozen top wilderness parks and reserves, across Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. Originally, I was pretty focused on the Okavango Delta in Botswana, but I’ve since discovered the very high prices there. I’ve read that it’s the result of a government policy to keep tourist numbers very low—this drives up costs, but also makes for superlative wilderness experiences, since you feel like you’ve got the place basically to yourself. 

On the one hand, we’re in our mid-forties, can afford a higher-quality experience if we wish, and we’re definitely not looking for a bare-bones experience done on the cheap. I want to spend at least a few nights in a wilderness lodge/camp that’s actually in the wilderness—I don’t want everything to be done on a drive from the nearest town, and I’m a bit leery of being in one of seven jeeps lined up around the same elephant, or something. On the other hand, I wonder if the difference in experience between Botswana and other places is truly worth prices that are triple or more than those places, especially for first-timers. Maybe there are places that offer a comparable experience for less, and I don't want to get hung up on Botswana just because it was my first thought.

Also, I think we’d like to go on an organized tour for most, if not all, of our time in Africa. I’ve travelled independently many times before, including in third-world regions/countries like Southeast Asia and Mexico. But the transportation infrastructure in southern Africa appears to require a car rental, and I’m not sure I want to do much of that, if at all. I have no experience with 4WD/off-roading, and I don’t especially enjoy driving in general. My wife also has safety concerns for the region, and I can’t say those thoughts hadn’t occurred to me as well, though more so for South Africa than Botswana or Namibia.

With all that in mind, I’d looked at a few options from G Adventures. Their [Delta & Falls Discoverer](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/delta-and-falls-discoverer/DZDF/) tour covers my top two priorities, but accommodation for this tour is in towns, not on game reserves themselves, and all transportation is by road, sometimes with 5-hour drives in a day. I’d thought of maybe combining this with a self-drive to Etosha National Park from Windhoek, where we could hopefully spend 2-3 nights at a slower pace and get a taste of the wilderness lodge/camp experience. But I worry about everything else feeling rushed and glossed over.

Another option is the [Botswana & Zimbabwe Safari](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/botswana-zimbabwe-safari/DZXNG/). This is a National Geographic-branded tour with more upscale transportation and accommodation, including wilderness lodge/camp stays. In terms of the itinerary, this is almost exactly what I had in mind, and I really like the lodge/camp aspect of the tour. The price, however, is around 3.5 times more than the previous tour, and with airfare from North America and other costs, this will be my most expensive trip ever, by far.

A third tour option feels like a compromise between the two: [Explore Kruger & Victoria Falls](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/explore-kruger-and-victoria-falls/DSUNG/). This is also a National Geographic-branded tour, which also includes the wilderness lodge/camp experience that I’m looking for, but at half the price of the previous option, presumably due to the lower costs of Kruger versus the Okavango. 

So, my questions. Is Botswana and/or the Okavango Delta really worth it? What about for those doing a safari for the first time? Is a tour the way to go, or is it better to travel independently, self-drive, and/or book wilderness lodges/camps of our choosing? Are there options I’m missing?

Many thanks!","['I went with G Adventures last year on one of their camping trips from Cape Town to Victoria Falls and then onto Johannesburg and had a great time.\n\nI don’t think you can go wrong with any of the options you’ve looked at.\n\nThe Deltas and Falls Discoverer gets you an overnight camping in the Okavango Delta. Chobe NP is literally a 5 minute drive from the accommodation in Kasane - I don’t know if there’s even accommodation within the NP there and the boat cruise is great. I’ve seen stunning photos of the elephants that just come out to chill at the accommodation in Nata. \n\nAdding on some time in Etosha after you get to Windhoek wound round it all nicely.', 'Thanks very much for your response.\n\nI’m sure you’re right about Chobe—seems like all the accommodation is in or around Kasane, regardless of budget level.

Take the mokoro’s in, find a nice patch of land and set up. It’s basic basic - no running water, dig a hole in the ground for a toilet etc. Saw a bunch of hippo’s on the mokoro trip in and elephants and zebras on our afternoon walk. I really enjoyed it.\n\nEtosha was great - didn’t see any elephants there, but saw a bunch of other animals. In the Okaukuejo Camp there’s a floodlit watering hole that you can sit at and watch animals come at all times of day and night. Quite unique and definitely a highlight.', ""Thanks a lot. If you went back, would you consider renting a car and self-driving anywhere you'd been? Or would you stick with the guided tours?"", 'Maybe Garden Route out of Cape Town and the road between Etosha and Windhoek was fine but Botswana we spent half the time dodging potholes and the half dodging elephants. Roads were pretty shit majority of the time.\n\nI definitely wouldn’t self drive for a safari - wouldn’t see half as much as what you see with a guide.', 'Thanks. After some further thought, I think we might go with the “compromise option”—maybe [something like this](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/explore-southern-africa/DSLNG/). I think we feel that a nice, more upmarket safari lodge experience is important to us, but I just can’t justify the high cost of doing that in the Okavango. South Africa seems to offer a better value proposition than other countries while still being in striking distance from Victoria Falls. And then I thought, if we’re going all that way, might as well fit Cape Town in as well, for a rounder experience. It’s our first Africa trip, so we can see what we like without spending top dollar and maybe come back in a few years for something more specialized if the region truly speaks to us.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your advice! Very helpful!', 'Looks like a good option.\n\nWould definitely recommend extra time in Cape Town.']"

61,New Business Traveler- Seeking Reward Advice (Domestic US Travel),1,d0wl52,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/d0wl52/new_business_traveler_seeking_reward_advice/,10,1567895034.0,"If this post is better for another sub, I’d welcome that feedback. 

Just got a new job where I’ll be traveling 35-45 weeks/year. I’ve never travelled for work and don’t know how to maximize benefits/rewards for frequent flying and hotel stays. I’m a little overwhelmed with all of the programs and how they work. 

I will mostly stay in Marriott hotels. I will usually have the option to fly either Delta or United. 

I’ll stay in hotels much more than I’ll fly, because I will do a lot of driving to my work locations. I will fly 10-20 times/year, but I’ll be in hotels for well over 200 nights per year. I like the idea of doing a brand loyal program because of the upgrades that come along with them (like flight upgrades, airport lounges, free checked bags, hotel suite upgrades, free hotel stays). 

Therefore, is my best option to go with two separate cards, one Marriott rewards card and one either United or Delta? Are there cards that combine the two?  Or because I'm staying in hotels more than flying, should I just get a Marriott card and strictly use that for all travel expenses then just accrue airline miles as I fly by being a member of the program without a card (and also have the option of transferring Marriott points to Delta or United)?  

Any advice on travel cards or how to maximize rewards is greatly appreciated. ","['I think United and Marriott have a reciprocal arrangement: https://thepointsguy.com/guide/marriott-united-rewardsplus/', 'Get on Marriott\'s email list. You will periodically want to sign up for things as the result of email - things like points kickers for staying in multiple brands, etc. You will see these same offers when you sign into your Marriott account and check the offers section\n\nTo get status faster, you may want to do mildly insane things like staying in different Marriott properties every night, as if those are counted as discrete ""stays"" versus versus 1 4 night ""stay""\n\nRead up on their credit cards - you may not want to jump on the first offer you see. For example, I did the United card when I got a 70k mile bonus whereas the normal one is 50k. Right now in my inbox, I have an offer for a 100k Amex Bonvoy card, which sounds promising.\n\nI am not a hardcore points guy - I have probably stayed 50 nights in Marriott in the last 7 years - half my travel for work is international where Marriott was historically weak, or Vegas. I try to stick with Marriott domestically, and use Expedia internationally. I have gotten a couple free nights in Marriotts off of points by virtue of sticking with them for business travel - you should be able to get far more out of the program than I do. FYI, I have found it better to use my points internationally - I have gotten free nights in AC Hotels in Bologna and Valencia, Spain for some 1x,000 points whereas when I was in San Francisco in the spring, a night in the city was 4x,000 points or more. Likewise, I once had a ""free"" night certificate expire on me because it was classed to certain tiers of properties, and in the US, I couldn\'t find a city with a property in that tier', 'Check out the Marriott forum at Flyertalk.com.

I’m training all of October and November, so I’ll start checking out the credit card special offers and hold out for a good one. \nI’ve been thinking that since I will probably be in hotels 200+ nights per year I might do Hilton and Marriott, since I can probably get to the top tier of each, credit card or not.\nYour recommendation for switching hotels to get stays at different properties is a great idea. Sometimes I’ll be in rural locations without that option, but I’ll keep it in mind when I’m not. My father in law does that to max out his rewards too. \nThanks again for your insight.', 'Checking it now, thank you.', ""> I’ve been thinking that since I will probably be in hotels 200+ nights per year I might do Hilton and Marriott, since I can probably get to the top tier of each, credit card or not\n\nI don't see the point of splitting loyalty. I'd just stick to one, probably Marriott. This is especially because you can achieve Diamond status with Hilton just for signing up for a credit card. Lessens the need to work for the status, but, on the other hand, it does mean you can start off top-tier. But I ultimately feel Marriott has more valuable points and the better program.\n\nAlso, I don't think there is a way to qualify for Marriott status on stays, so that strategy is pointless. Do a status challenge if you can't wait."", 'Thanks for replying. According to my research Marriott’s entire status system is based on stays.

The latter does have some benefit with promotions and welcome points offers though."", 'Oh, I’m following now.

64,"Removed from Delta Flight for ""Suspended Ticket""",10,9cmkgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9cmkgy/removed_from_delta_flight_for_suspended_ticket/,7,1536018787.0,"On September 1st on the third leg of a trip back from Ukraine, I was removed from a flight about 1 minute prior to departure and told that my ticket was ""suspended"". In the next two hours, I was given no reason why this happened.

Let me start from the beginning.

I began to board the flight and the ticket (scanned from phone) was rejected (red light). The staff then pulled me to the side and couldn't quickly resolve the problem so I was told to wait. Everyone boarded and then the staff member tried various things, none of which I know (other than he said he tried to ""unhook"" the ticket) using a GUI screen listing tickets. Then another staff member used a terminal/non-GUI screen and I can't even guess what was done.

Then I was given a paper ticket and boarded. I asked if the seat was the same and boarded. At this point I was as far as I remember the last person to sit down. A minute or two later a staff member came and pulled me from the plane and told me the ticket was suspended and to get my luggage.

For two hours I was talking to staff at a Delta desk and by phone. About one hour into this, Delta staff left and I worked on the rest alone by phone. Eventually I was given another ticket for the next day, about 10 hours later. 

At no point did anyone give me a solid answer why this happened. A few answers that I heard was that I needed to buy another ticket (of course I didn't because I know the ticket was paid for), something about ""fraud"" was another answer, one employee stated that everything looked fine and they couldn't understand why this happened.

Just thought I would share this. You can imagine I was pretty angry. By this point I was so exhausted I could barely stand, but never was able to sleep because of the loud music in the airport, cleaning (early morning), security announcements, etc. It was impossible to sleep.

**Response from Delta on FB:
**
> Yes, that is the information that I need thank you. It looks like there was an error made on our end with your reservation in regards to the validity of the ticket. I am very sorry that you had this experience. *TBR

and the gates were located on the complete opposite sides of the terminal. i had to run down the entire length of the terminal. from gate 72 to gate 7, all in 15-20 minutes. i tried to make it but apparently i was late by 2 minutes. they closed the doors a few minutes earlier and that fucked me. coupled with getting delayed a few minutes while getting off my first plane

the whole thing was bull shit to be honest. had no control over it and just got fucked due to circumstance. thankfully i was able to get on the next flight which was 4 hours later. it was either that or a flight 8 hours later which would have totally fucked up my trip

how do i avoid this mess from happening again? i think i shouldn't book flights with short lay overs anymore and give myself at least 2-3 hours. it fucking sucks but i can't handle my trips getting randomly fucked over like this

i paid $60 for preferred seats on the flight i missed too. now i'm gonna get stuck with a stupid middle seat in between 2 people for 4 hours. and then i have to spend time calling delta at the end of this to get my money back

what a lame horse shit","[""Why would you change anything?\n\nSeriously, bear with me.\n\nYou took a 1 hour layover versus a 5 hour layover. Probably 95% of the time, you make the flight, and you don't spend 4 hours of your life sitting on your hands at the airport. Given you were on an airline with 2 more flights to your destination, you book the short layover EVERYTIME, EVERYDAY.\n\nIt is only when you are looking at airline X whose layover is 73 minutes, and you determine that airline X only has one flight a day to your destination should you be worried, as missing that layover then likely means you are being stuck somewhere for the night because the only way to get to your destination with them is the next day's flight to that locale."", 'Not a lot of sympathy when you booked 2 separate flights with 60 minutes in between? \n\nAnd you are asking how to avoid this happening again?       \n\nWhat kind of answers do you expect?', 'In these situations it would be best to book your connections on the same airline.

Sucks you had to learn the hard way, but you probably won't make that mistake again."", ""It really depends on the airline tbh. Some airlines will hold flights, especially if there are a number of passengers who're in the same situation. I've had that happen recently with Ethiopian Airlines and Icelandair. I've never had that happen with any of the US carriers, though I've heard that they sometimes did hold flights (inconsistently) prior to over 20 years ago. \n\nHonestly, it's best to have longer connection times and even then that can go to hell.

She stepped to the side to call customer service and the man behind her with the same problem was granted a new boarding pass and let on the plane after complaining about missing a funeral. When my girlfriend asked why he was let on with the exact some situation she was told by the gate agent that he was let on for weight distribution reasons and that it was his discretion on who to let on.  (GF is 5""5', 120 lbs.)

After spending the last 6 or so hours on the phone, Virgin is blaming delta for a ""computer glitch"" that didn't update boarding passes in whatever database.

I am currently sitting on a 737 that just touched down in JFK. This flight was suppose to leave this morning at 7:50am, 6 hour flight from Seattle to New York.

I  understand Calgary is a ""trusted port"" or whatever, so i can do US Customs there instead of at MSP on the way back (or so i'm told).  But again: not sure which itinerary to book b/c i'm not sure how long everything takes.

It will be more or less be just making a domestic connection.\n\nOn the inbound (Canada>US) trip, assuming you\'re coming back through Calgary, you do complete all US immigration and customs formalities in Calgary. So when you land in MSP on your inbound trip, you also don\'t have to go through security or pick up your bags and it will just be like making a domestic connection.\n\nIf you are booking this all on one trip (which you should), airlines will not let you book an impossible-to-make connection because single trips with connections have to respect what\'s called \'Minimum Connection Time.\' That said, sometimes I do opt for a slightly longer connection, but that\'s just a personal preference.', '> i\'m connecting thru MSP into Calgary, on Delta.

Just don’t be surprised if you get there and it’s not actually operated by Delta.

I'm going to Oslo, Norway in September of this year, and am looking at flights. I'm flying from the US.

Even a 30 minute delay can make things difficult.\n\nYou're going to land in terminal 2E Hall K, L (or M!) and will have to hoof it through passport control and possibly security to get to terminal 2F.  2E Hall M is a satellite terminal, that means catching a train between terminals.\n\nGiven the size of CDG you could easily have to walk a mile to make the connection.\n\nThe passport/security lines can be terrible, but international flights are almost always red-eyes that land really early in the morning, when the airport is usually quiet.\n\nAre you going solo?  Are you a fast walker?  Is the first flight generally on time if you check the history?  You can probably do it."", ""CDG is notoriously bad to connect through. I have done it many time on Delta flights to other points in Europe though. 90 minutes is tight but doable. They make sure you get through it time.

I'm currently booking a trip to Peru for my mother and myself. I live near Detroit, Michigan so I can book out of either Detroit (DTW) or I can take the four hour drive into Toronto (YYZ) to fly out of there if the cost is right.

I left out of Toronto for my last trip to Europe with Air Canada and the flight was great and I saved around $800. So, after seeing that I would be saving around $1,000 leaving out of Toronto this time I went ahead and booked that flight with Air Canada. I didn't realize until I was almost finished with checkout that there's a difference between Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge.

Seeing that I have 24 hours to refund my booking I went ahead and finished the purchase but now looking at reviews I'm getting really worried about the Air Canada Rouge flight (which is 8 hours). It looks like every single review recommend upgrading to premium seats which aren't great but better, the upgrade would be about $400 additional for myself and my mom.

My alternative option would be to book with Delta from Detroit for the extra $1,000 dollars. I should have enough Delta Skymiles points to pay for this flight (it would be all of my points, about 150,000 points) but I'm still spending about $600 extra in my miles to fly with Delta instead of Rouge. I wouldn't make this choice but flying with my older mom, I'm very worried she'll be miserable on the Rouge flight.

So I guess my question is how does Air Canada Rouge and Delta compare? I'm only really concerned with seat comfort. We can bring our own food and in flight entertainment. Any advice is appreciated!

Would like to end the trip with a beach jaunt, either at Koh Rong in Cambodia or Phu Quoc. Was considering a further cruise around the Mekong Delta region, that could reach or get close to either of those destinations.

Please weigh in with recommended companies or tour groups. Would also love to hear any other must do's, great food, hospitable guesthouses, fun bars or wonderful places to visit. We have about 3 weeks and would like to spend one of them chilling on the beach.

Travelling with my partner. We love food, culture, history, outdoorsy stuff and chilling with a few beers.

We always preboard with our 7-year-old son Henry, who is on the autism spectrum, because the boarding process can be very overwhelming for him (crowds, noise, etc). After boarding in Minneapolis, a flight attendant named Natalie came over to introduce herself and see if Henry needed anything. The kiddo immediately took a shine to her and started asking all sorts of questions about the plane. Natalie went out of her way to bring over demo oxygen masks and life jackets for Henry to look at. She surprised him with a chocolate bar and extra cookies. She listened as he talked about being on the spectrum and about how loud noises bothered him. After finding out that his birthday was the previous week, she got together with the other flight attendants and made a crown of cookie packages for him to wear and came over to wish him a happy birthday. She arranged for the pilot to come over the intercom and give a special welcome to Henry and thank him for his help during the flight. She was a friend to a little boy who doesn't always feel like he has too many of those. When the flight landed at LaGuardia, the pilot presented him with special golden wings (just like the pilots wear), let him try on his hat, and then the crew got together for pictures.

Natalie and the rest of team on Delta Flight 1596 went above and beyond the call of duty to help him feel special. Henry later said that he ""felt like a FIRST CLASS passenger"" and said that he would ""never forget my best friend Natalie."" You can't get much better than that.","['Nice story.\n\nI hope you wrote a letter to the airline so your accolades go into the personnel files of the Natalie and the crew.', ""I'm so sorry you had to have such a pleasant experience and then immediately follow it up by landing at the 2nd worst place on earth, LaGuardia.

My boss is sending me on a business trip to Charlotte NC from tomorrow until this Friday and needs me to book my flights today. 

My girlfriend and I were considering going on a trip to Raleigh, NC this weekend, depending on her work schedule for the weekend which she finds out tomorrow (about a 50/50 shot she can go) 

My company will pay for my round trip flight whether the second leg of the trip leaves from Charlotte or Raleigh and regardless of the dates but it needs to be booked today (it’ll likely be through delta)

The ""high demand"" screen displayed is if, after going through the reservation process, there aren\'t any tickets in the original fare bucket left. If you\'re booking and it tries to grab a K fare for instance, but when it actually goes to ticketing it reports K0, the ""high demand"" screen pops up. It then presents the user with the option of booking a fare one fare bucket up (Q in my hypothetical example) or the option of canceling the transaction completely.

This happens with all airlines and has to do with the ancient reservation systems that date back to the 1960\'s.\n\nIn this case, the fact that OP searched again and it once again displayed the lower fare bucket shows that Delta\'s website needs to update its fare database from the reservation and ticketing system more often, or have the logic that if a ticketing action fails to update the fare database for that route.\n\nFWIW this happens even dealing with phone agents or travel agents with direct GDS access. It\'s not super common but not unheard of to hear a phone agent say ""it won\'t let me ticket that fare"". It happens to me a few times a year.

You're trying to apply modern design to a system originally developed in the 1960's.

And yes, it's been going on since airline reservations and ticketing was first computerized in the 1960's.\n\nEdit: if you're really curious, look up [GDS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Distribution_System) systems and how they interact with each airline's [CRS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_reservations_system).\n\nEdit2: Delta's system dates to the 60's but American Airlines first invented this shit back in the 40's."", 'First, the Canadian blog post you linked was from 2011. In 2012 legislation was introduced that requires Airlines to show the true final price in all advertising (including interactive) [1] I believe there is similar legislation in the EU but can\'t find a source ATM.\n\n\nSecond, you\'ve not given me a technical reason why the ticket can\'t be ""held"" during the time it takes to enter payment information.

Of course it has.\n\n\n\nThird, even if there was a problem caused by the legacy backend system, the Delta website itself is not from the 1960\'s. If it tries to complete a sale and finds a fare that is no longer valid, there is no good technical reason it can\'t update its locally cached information to show to future visitors. It\'s literally one row in a database.\n\n\nDo you work in the industry? Or Delta specifically?

I’m currently planning a trip to Vietnam with my partner (both around 30 in case that helps with suggestions) during the first two weeks of August and am hoping to get some guidance on if the itinerary makes sense and if we should be tweaking it to compress certain places to maximize time in other areas. If you have suggestions on other places we should try to fit in with the time we have then we’re also open to suggestions. I have the flights to Ho Chi Minh already so they’re pretty set in stone, but the rest is fairly flexible.

Right now the plan is the following:

August 5th: Arrive in Ho Chi Minh around 10 am

August 5th: fly to Da Nang, stay in Hoi An for 4 nights (Visit Da Nang and Hue)

August 9th: fly to Hai Phong and head straight to Ha Long Bay, spend 1 night

August 10th: transit to Hanoi, spend 2 nights

August 12th: visit Ninh Binh, spend 2 nights in Tam Coc

August 14th: fly to Ho Chi Minh, spend 3 nights, visit Mekong Delta

August 17th: Flight to Canada around 6 pm

I'm currently Delta Gold Medallion (via an old status match) but willing to status match to another airline. Really only interested in upgrades since I just started a new job where I'll travel frequently for work and have points accrued on credit cards that I can use for reward redemptions. In your experience what FFP is the best for airline status upgrades out of NY airports? I’m pretty equidistant from all 3 so don’t have a preference for one over another. I’d prefer to not exclusively fly Delta for example if I will never have a chance at being upgraded at the mid tier level.

Somewhat intrigued by Alaska since I'll be traveling transcon a decent amount and they have pretty solid miles promotions but unsure about their reliability.  


Will be flying 50k+ miles and 30+ segments.

Purchase economy tickets with premium economy on transcon or international flights

Will mostly fly Domestic US (8-10 transcon/ year) and 1-2x per year to Europe","[""If you don't think you'll make it past mid-tier with anyone, *any* upgrade is gonna be a stroke of luck. NYC is swarming with elites for all of the big three.\n\nAlaska is a great airline (with arguably the best loyalty program in the US these days) but they're also incredibly focused on the west coast (and PNW specifically) with only a few transcon flights. It doesn't make sense (and isn't really possible) to be loyal to them if you live in NY. You can still credit AA flights to them I think, but you won't get Alaska elite benefits on AA. Also note that Alaska's premium transcon product is just normal domestic first, while most of their competitors have a much nicer premium product on many of their transcon routes.\n\nDelta has by far the best actual product...which they know and has caused them to deemphasize their loyalty program. But in your situation, I'd personally go with the consistently better product and look at upgrades as a special bonus when and if they happen. Or if you decided you actually *do* care about award mile earning, I'd probably go with United instead."", 'It really is highly dependent on where you travel and which airlines hold hubs at NYC. For the most part every airline flies into NYC so you’d mainly be looking at where you fly to the most.\n\nAlaska is great but majority of their routes are on the west coast.

You may have luck if you are very flexible in planning days and times with a low elite load.  Delta have made some great strides with offerings at NYC area airports in the last couple of years. I agree with other sentiment here on Alaska; great airline but focused more in the West although they seem to be making an effort on transcon flights.  Jet Blue get high marks especially with their Mint product on coast-to-coast routes.', ""American Airlines has been downsizing their hub at JFK and focusing more on Philadelphia, so probably not the best choice. Though they do fly out of a nice new terminal which seems empty most of the time.\n\nJetBlue is a nice airline but their loyalty program is a joke.\n\nAlaska, forget about it, only useful for flying to the west coast.\n\nThat leaves United and Delta. United has the stronger frequent flyer program of the two, Delta has the better product. Though as another poster pointed out, out of NYC getting upgrades on United won't exactly be easy either, and their frequent flyer program has been watered down as well in recent years. If it were me, I would pick based on which airport was easier for me to get to (JFK or Newark). If they were both equally far, I would probably go with Delta, as I think they're just overall a better airline and that's more important to me than frequent flyer perks."", ""Skymiles have been devalued extremely, but are still useful if you can take advantage of sales.\n\nIn any case, I'd get CCs for AA, United, and Delta to accumulate points on all of them unless you know you can do all your travel on one carrier.  AA is the easiest to generate lots of points via CCs."", ""JetBlue Mosaic doesn't come with any upgrade possibility so it's pretty useless to OP"", ""True, but you can upgrade with points. and can get $99 upgrades for less than 1,000 points ($20). CRazy valuation of points on these upgrades only available to mosaic.

My name had been randomly selected for a security check, so all my bags were searched before boarding. No issues there. Later Mo and I are sitting in our seats on the plane, and take off is in 15 minutes, when an air hostess comes to us and tells us that Mo was randomly selected for a check and he needs to get off and bring his bags with him. I smirk, amused at how 'random' this check is. Only one person, the only Arab on the flight, was ""randomly"" selected for a check - whilst already on our plane and minutes away from take off. He makes a joke asking they don't leave without him to which they say they won't. Mo goes with them, I wait in my seat.

5 minutes later the woman comes back, tells me that Mo has set off some kind of security alarm, and that we need to take our bags off. Apparently some explosive alarm set off, so we need to wait for the police and we will therefore likely miss our flight. I mention racial profiling to which she says it isn't and this is normal procedure (I don't see any other white people being taken off the flight). The police arrives, as expected find nothing, and the flight is still there but they tell us we can't get back on, and our suitcases have already been removed.
We are then put on a later flight which isn't direct and involves a connection, lands us 9 hours later than originally planned (in the process ruining all of the plans we had made for that afternoon/evening). I then ask if we are getting an upgrade or anything to which I get told no.

109,"Can you stay in an airport lounge on arrival? For how long, and what happens to your luggage? (JFK in NYC)",1,chaitx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/chaitx/can_you_stay_in_an_airport_lounge_on_arrival_for/,7,1564014998.0,"Hello!  My wife and I are traveling to the East Coast of the US in September.  She's going for work in Baltimore, and I'm tagging along for fun!  

Our first stop is at JFK in New York, and we were planning on taking advantage of the Delta Lounge to shower before we head to our hotel.  

* I arrive at JFK on a Thursday morning by 8am from SJC.  
* She will arrive the same (Thursday) morning around 11am from BWI.  (Work is paying for her round trip to Baltimore, so I'm flying directly to NYC, and she's taking a quick plane from Baltimore to NYC and back).  
* Both flying Delta to get to NYC.  My flight to JFK is a red-eye (evening wed to morning thurs), and hers is just an early morning ""commuter?"" flight.  
* I am a SkyMiles member and Amex Delta Gold Card holder, but I'm not quite at any of the fancier reward numbers, so from what I see, it'd be the ""normal"" $35/person at the lounge.  I don't mind the cost for the shower/place to hang out before we head into the city.

Our questions are as follows:

1.  **Can you stay in the airport lounges upon arrival?**  From what I saw on the website/some travel forums it looks like you can as long as you have/have had a flight that day.
2.  I'll arrive 3 hours before her.  **If I can stay in a lounge upon arrival, how long can I stay?  Do you know what I can do about my luggage?**  

Most of the rest of the trip I believe is planned out, we're just hoping I don't have to wait in the baggage area for a few hours by myself, and that we can relax in the lounge a bit.  

I couldn't find anything regarding the luggage/what to do with it if I want to stay on the ""Gate"" side of security, and I don't mind asking the airport/airline, I just wasn't sure who to ask! 

Thanks, and sorry if this has been answered and I didn't find it.


Edit:  Looks like #1 is a yes!  So I can hang out as long as needed, as for the luggage thing, it's more or less what I expected, I'll see if we can pack all our things into our persona/carry on.

110,"Looking for help. AA cancelled flight and can't get us home for 2 extra days, but won't recognize flights with other airlines?",6,ca9fsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ca9fsg/looking_for_help_aa_cancelled_flight_and_cant_get/,5,1562549628.0,"So I'm not sure if this is an appropriate subreddit but since so many people travel a lot I thought ya'll may have experience with this situation and how to handle American Airlines customer service.

&#x200B;

My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

112,Delta Employee's Unwillingness to Change my Flight Caused Me to Miss a Chunk of My Buddy's Bachelor Party,0,8sg1ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8sg1ll/delta_employees_unwillingness_to_change_my_flight/,4,1529504355.0,"I'll try to keep this as concise as possible:

My good buddy's bachelor party was last weekend in Phoenix (Friday June 15th - Saturday June 17th). I flew from Vancouver to Salt Lake City to Phoenix on Friday. When I got to Salt Lake City I missed my connector because of tight time  between the flights as well as a gate change that didn't update on my eticket. Okay, can't really blame anyone for that, it happens, all good...

So at this point it is 11:00 am and Delta puts me on a different flight [this one](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL5708/history/20180615/2141Z/KSLC/KPHX) which was scheduled to leave at 3:30 pm. Great, I was going to get there a little late but still in time to make it to the baseball game which was a big part of my buddy's bachelor party.

But then the flight got delayed, twice, to 5:00 pm. This was going to be really close for me to be able to make the game so I asked a Delta employee if there were any other flights leaving earlier. She says no but I checked online and saw that [this flight](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/CPZ5741/history/20180615/2300Z/KSLC/KPHX) existed that departed at 4:50 pm. I know it was only scheduled to leave 10 minutes earlier than the other flight but every minute counts and this flight **had not experienced any delays** unlike the first one that I linked. It was reasonable to be concerned that if that flight was delayed twice it may happen again. So I ask to be changed to the flight that departs at 4:50 pm instead of 5:00 pm and the employee said to me that it's only 10 minutes and not worth her changing it.

Seriously? It only takes a minute and a few clicks to do and could potentially help me out. The fact that she refused to change my flight was disrespectful and ended up costing me. Anyways, the 5:00 pm flight which I was still scheduled to be on was delayed twice more (4x total) and left at 6:49 pm, 3 hours 18 minutes late. I tried to go back to the counter after learning of the third delay and asked again to be changed to the 4:50 pm flight but by that time it was full.

I ended up missing the baseball game and now here I am looking at pictures of my buddies enjoying themselves at the game. If the Delta employee would have been willing to do something so relatively trivial I could have been there with them.","[""While unfortunate that the Delta employee didn't change your flight, I do think (a) it was understandable given the information at the time and (b) it seems like you missing your connection (which sounds like your fault) was the primary reason for missing part of the event."", 'Not if his original two flights were on one ticket and everyone connecting missed it (which is my guess or else they wouldn’t have provided him another flight at all?).', ""The incoming flight was a mere [four minutes late](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL5766/history/20180615/1410Z/CYVR/KSLC) (edit: and I thought minimum connecting time at SLC for DL is 30 minutes). Doubt that makes or breaks the connection. OP admitted they didn't look at the correct gate information. \n\nIt could be OP's fault and still have Delta rebook them. It would be neither the first nor the last time an airline takes pity on a passenger for their error. And I wouldn't be surprised if the fact that they were already rebooked due to OP's own error may have informed the representative's decision not to move them onto a flight seemingly departing just ten minutes earlier. "", 'Agreed then. And that’s a great resource I’ve never seen.']"

I declined to join the volunteer list and didn't submit a bid, but we bought the cheapest tickets on this flight and we won't be assigned seats until we get to the gate, so I'm afraid we'll be chosen. So I wanted to ask, what sort of compensation and accommodation should I expect or ask for? Also, I don't want to be separated from my brother but we bought tickets separately so its not under the same confirmation/receipt.","[""Don't worry, you'll be fine.\n\nAirlines will do almost anything to keep someone from being bumped. They will ask for volunteers, and will keep raising the value until someone steps forward. Only something like 0.09% of people get involuntary bumped nowadays. This is because if someone is involuntary bumped, the airline has to pay around 200% of your ticket value back to you if you are between 2-4 hours late or 400% of your ticket if it's over 4 hours. You could get something like 1300 dollars back in addition to the airline rerouting you.\n\nThus, they will definitely get volunteers and you don't need to worry. "", ""Talk to your brother. If you're both ok with with a later flight then you should put in the same bid (although that's not a guarantee that you'll stick together). I doubt they'll give you accommodation, it looks like they're only giving gift certificates, which isn't the greatest deal.""]"

\~AirCanada's website is still searching.... (plus, we would prefer to not fly with them, too many issues in the past with delays/cancellations)

The only time you’re eligible for some additional compensation would be if you were denied boarding, as is the case when the flight is oversold and you’re the last one standing when the music stops. \n\nAs someone else pointed out, some sort of travel insurance would be your only recourse here. I rarely head to the airport without it these days. BHTP is a good choice... they have an air only option that’s not full travel insurance, more like inconvenience insurance if something goes wrong (flat rate if you miss a connection, bag doesn’t make it, etc).

130,2-week Itinerary for Vietnam - any advice?,4,bk1vt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bk1vt2/2week_itinerary_for_vietnam_any_advice/,10,1556869843.0,"Hi,

6 guys going to Vietnam here. We're all quite young and want to see as much of Vietnam as possible in our time. Our tickets are booked to land in Ho Chi Minh on the 13th June and leaving from Hanoi on the 28th. Our current itinerary is looking something like this:

&#x200B;

12th: Late flight landing in HCMC at 1am

13th: Explore city, arrange to get some clothes tailored and picked up or sent to us.

14th: Mekong Delta Tour

15th: Cu Chi Tunnels

16th: Travel to Da Nang, Golden Bridge & Da Nang Beach

17th: Hue day visit

18th: From Da Nang, travel to and explore Hoi An & stay the night

19th: Explore Hoi An and return to Da Nang in the evening

20th: Travel from Da Nang to Hanoi

21st: Relax in Hanoi, enjoy the nightlife

22nd: Explore Hanoi some more

23rd-24th: 2-Day tour to Sapa Hills

25th-26th: HaLong Bay (1 night, 2 days)

27th: Hanoi Food tour and packing

28th: Flight back home

&#x200B;

I feel like there is a lot of room to explore and go beyond Hanoi between the 21st and 28th.

* I'd love to explore places such as Phang Nha National Park, do you have any suggestions for beautiful nature spots like this that might be within our reach?
* I've also done some research and seen that Cat Ba island is a good alternative to Halong Bay or that Halong Bay is not worth it, any opinions on this?
* Currently we just plan to stay at AirBnBs/hostels at the places we are visiting, and travelling from Da Nang to Hanoi by plane. I've seen sleeper trains are available, given our tight schedule do you think these will allow us to visit some more spots?
* My main concern is missing out on some beautiful spots or not making the most use of our time. Open to any suggestions to alter our plan. As long as it starts in HCMC and ends in Hanoi, we're open to anything!

Thanks!","['I think it looks like a good plan - and personally I loved Halong Bay. I know people like to shit talk it, but it was one of the most beautiful places I’ve been too, and if you stay overnight the boats take you far out where it’s peaceful. Everyone on our trip had a wonderful time and we made some great friends :)\n\nMy hunch is that the haters only went on a day trip which is a LONG drive from Hanoi, and wouldn’t give you long to get beyond the busy port area where everybody else is. \n\nThe only thing you might want to consider on your plan is that the end of it might be extremely tiring. Both Sapa and Halong Bay are generally accessed from Hanoi and neither are close - so going between them will be a lot of time in a car/on a train. But worth it if you’re ok with that!\n\nBtw when you’re in Hanoi, book a tour with Hanoi e-buddies, it’s completely free (you just tip what you want), and a local student will show you around or take you on a food tour. It was a great way to get to know the city', ""Was in VN in December and went to many of the same places, and went in reverse. Here are my thoughts :\n\nHCMC. I didn't care for the Mekong Delta tour. The Delta itself is about a 2 hour speed boat ride away and when you get to the Delta, you're taken to these touristy outposts. I really enjoyed the scooter tours tho. I took a food tour at night and it was loads of fun.  Really liked Saigon more than \nI thought I would. \n\nHow are you getting from HCMC to Danang?  They're not close. Also that bridge that is on everyone's IG is not a public bridge that's free. It's set in an amusement park and it's about $30 USD in cost to enter. Just FYI. I recommend seeing Marble Mountain in Danang. It was pretty awesome. You can go there on the way to Hue or Hoian, it's on the main road. \n\nAlso I looooved HoiAn  and wish we spent more than a day there. It's the most charming place. If I could have taken a day from our itinerary it would maybe have been from Hue. Maybe. \n\nThe 2 day trip to Halong Bay was awesome, esp once you get out a bit further . Take a kayak out and enjoy the quiet. \n\nDidn't go to Sapa but met many people who did and loved it. \n\nTake as many food tours as you can. Super fun and you get to try all the different regions specialties. Have fun!"", '**Notice:** Are you asking for travel advice about Vietnam?\n\nRead what redditors had to say in the **[weekly destination thread for Vietnam](http://redd.it/2kknxb)** \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I did some additional research and settled on Bai Tu Long Bay instead. Check it out if you still want an alternative to Ha Long."", 'Hi,\n\nI think we’ll stick with Halong Bay. To compensate for the back to back Sapa Hills -> Halong Bay, I think I’ll shift the “extra day” in Hanoi to fit between the two. Any suggestions for what to do with a full day in Hanoi?\n\nThanks', 'Hi, \n\nRegarding Mekong Delta, you think it’s still worth going but to spend the day also doing other activities in HCMC? In that case, what else do you recommend we do besides general touring of the city. \n\nFor HCMC to Danang, the plan is to fly, I looked into trains but they take a long long time to arrive. Thank you for the info regarding the bridge! Will look into the Marble Mountain.\n\nWill definitely keep Halong Bay on the itinerary & very keen to eat as much local cuisine as possible. Do you have any recommendations for specific food tours?', 'Hi,\n\nApologies for not being clear. The plan is to return to HCMC and then take a flight to Da Nang', 'Sounds like a good plan :) \n\nMy favourite thing in Hanoi was really just exploring the city on foot. I loved sitting on a little plastic stool outside a cafe, having a coffee on the roadside and watching the crazy traffic go by. \n\nThe train street is also fun and interesting to visit. Find the location and drop a pin on google maps so you can find it easily. And do a food tour like I mentioned above, this was great!\n\nHoax Kiem lake is also really cool as there’s always stuff going on, especially at the weekend. There’s basically a big park area where the locals hang out. \n\nFinally, I really recommend going to the Top of Hanoi sky bar for drinks. It’s a little further out so we grabbed a taxi. But go after sunset as the pollution in the city creates a smog that ruins the view unless you have the city lights shining through (gross I know!). Honestly they have a really bad pollution problem :(\n\nHope that helps!', ""The Mekong Delta is a FULL day, you start at 9 and don't get back til almost 5 and by then, you're too dead tired to do anything else.  I could be a little biased, tho, as I've been on the Mekong on the Laos side and it was the opposite of my experience in Saigon... it was  sublime and unspoiled there and a completely different vibe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I was just surfing around and saw that you can go to other sections along the Mekong and go biking, if you are into it.  Search Mekong Day tour and you'll find a few companies that run those tours.  Otherwise, I wish I had another day to just wander the streets of Saigon (also it was very hot when we went, so being outside wasn't so enjoyable).  The scooter food tour we did was with Vespa Adventures and I recommend them.  They took us to 5 or 6 places and your belly will def be full by night's end and everything was so good.  It was really fun experiencing the crazy, chaotic traffic.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn HoiAn I took a cooking class at the Red Dragon Restaurant.  They have a really great kitchen set up.  And have dinner or lunch at Morning Glory or Streets!  They were 2 of the best place we went to the entire trip.""]"

Planning to get there the night of August 6th. Due to some other things planned, the earliest possible flight I can take from my departing airport that day is around 6PM EST. 

Here is what I have it narrowed down to (all of these options have me arrive in LAS around the same time) :

-	Spirit nonstop in a Big Front Seat leaving PIT at 8:30PM. Total cost: $242. I have never taken Spirit before. 

-	Southwest connecting in PHX. Two hour layover. Departs PIT at 6:30PM. Cost: $366 for Wanna Get Away fare (Southwest also flies nonstop to LAS from PIT but their two nonstop flights are earlier in the day)

-	Delta connecting in ATL. 55 minute layover. Departs PIT at 6:41PM. Cost: $465 for First Class. $296 for Main Cabin. I have the budget for First Class and have taken it before. So that’s why I have it as an option. 

I do have some miles/points accrued with Delta and Southwest but not enough to redeem for these flights. 

I’m leaning towards Delta as they are my top airline (Southwest is #2) but I’m worried that if there is late day thunderstorms that day that could mess up my flights due to the semi-tight layover (example is the other night. Flight to ATL was delayed by over two hours due to storms and If I was traveling last night I would’ve missed my connecting flight.)I have more wiggle room with Southwest connecting in PHX. Plus I’ve never been to the PHX airport but I feel like if the lowest fare for that Southwest option is only $100 less than Delta first class I might as well take Delta. All of my previous Vegas trips have been via nonstop Southwest flights, but their schedule isn’t favorable this time for me. 

Any advice?","['Go with Delta. It’s cheaper than SW for main cabin and a much better product. If you want to do first class you can also book with a combination of money and the miles you’ve accrued.', 'If they are all getting you to the destination at the same time I would go with the cheapest option if that’s what matters to you, regardless of what you pick the thunderstorms will affect any flight.', ""I would avoid Spirit.

141,Delta screwed up our 2018 Honeymoon to Scotland,0,7iytaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7iytaf/delta_screwed_up_our_2018_honeymoon_to_scotland/,9,1512986352.0,"I'll try to keep this from being a novel.  I'm writing this only because after being on hold multiple times with Delta's customer service they just keep sending me to different departments and offering me no solutions (besides, essentially, ""That sucks for you."")

&nbsp;

**Trip Overview:** My wife and I have been saving up for close to three years for our honeymoon to Scotland.  We were finally able to accumulate enough Chase Points to book the flight.  We transferred our Chase Points to Flying Blue and booked our flight to Scotland in late September through Air France.  The flight goes ATL to JFK to EDI (and back), and the flight is technically through Delta.

&nbsp;

After booking our flight we used cash to upgrade the JFK to EDI flight to Comfort (roughly $400 on Delta's website).  This is for health safety reasons.  My wife has a rare form of muscular dystrophy, and while she is perfectly mobile, she does not do well on long flights (of which she's done many).  As such, the extra legroom in Comfort is better for her, and since its an overnight flight her doctor essentially told her it was necessary.  Again, we booked these tickets in September, paid in full for the upgrade, so none of this seemed like an issue.

&nbsp;

**The problem:** Today I was checking into another flight (tomorrow) and decided to briefly check the flight to Scotland (**The flight is at the end of June 2018**).  No reason other than to just look at it.  To my surprise, Delta changed both of the flights from JFK to EDI.  Specifically, these key changes happened:

* Our flight from JFK to EDI was moved back so now we have a 5.5 hour long layover at JFK
* Our seats were moved from Comfort back to Main Cabin (JFK to EDI)
* Our return flight from EDI to JFK was moved so that the plane lands at 2pm and our trip from JFK to ATL is at the exact same departure time
* Our seats were not only moved from Comfort to Main Cabin, but also not next to each other (EDI to JFK)

I wasn't notified of any of these changes and only discovered them on my own.  I'm really struggling with what to do.  My wife does not think she'll be able to handle the flight from New York to Scotland (ATL to JFK is better because its shorter).  Furthermore, everything in Scotland has already been paid for so our entire honeymoon is now in flux.

&nbsp;

Not only has Delta's customer service been unhelpful, they've yet to offer any solution besides, ""I'm sorry that your flight has been changed.""  When asking about the $400 I spent on seat upgrades they don't have an answer.  **So my question**, what are my options here?  I travel a lot for work and Delta has always been excellent, so this bump in the road at the worst possible time is more than frustrating.  Even more frustrating is Delta so far, through customer service, has come off completely uninterested in helping me and has shown zero sympathy for the predicament I'm in.

&nbsp;

Update: I just got a call from a Delta rep and here is what she told me in a nutshell.  One, they fixed our flight from EDI back to JFK to Atlanta, and now we have an hour and a half between flights.  Now, she also said that I need to contact Flying Blue because Delta changed a policy of theirs to no longer allow individuals to buy seats with points (on another website) and then pay to upgrade the seat on Delta.  This was her word and I wasn't aware of this.  She ""believes"" that I still have the Comfort Seats and just need to contact Flying Blue.  At this point she's told me Delta can't fix anything and its up to Flying Blue to correct our situation.  I guess I have more work to do.","[""It looks like you're in Atlanta...Delta's hub.

We have previously done a food on foot tour in Hanoi last year when we visited Vietnam and although it was very good it wasn't as personal as we would've liked. The tour guide was very nice and informative but it was a set itinerary for where we went to eat.

We would have liked it if he had suggested alternatives rather than us feeling like we hadn't got the most of the tour. 

Now obviously the tour we went on had a set itinerary of where we had to go and I know it would be very difficult to find a tour that is as personalised as we would like. If anyone has some suggestions of a tour that fits this description at all we would love your help and any other good food tour recommendations in any of the 3 cities is also appreciated.

155,Overland Camping Tour - 3 weeks in Southern Africa with Nomads,5,bwpfbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bwpfbj/overland_camping_tour_3_weeks_in_southern_africa/,2,1559687771.0,"I just wanted to make a trip report for my overland camping tour with Nomads. I've posted actual pictures of the sights in separate posts and might make more, but this is just a review and guide of the actual tour and day to day life on the tour.

&#x200B;

I also uploaded a bunch of photos of the truck, campgrounds, mealtimes, etc at this imgur in case you're interested:

 [https://imgur.com/a/wkswUVC](https://imgur.com/a/wkswUVC) 

&#x200B;

 So first of all, I went in May and I did this 20 day tour with Nomads. You can see the itinerary in the link as well.  
https://nomadtours.co.za/this-year/cape-town-to-victoria-falls/  


Tour companies: I did a lot of research between many overland tour companies, including G Adventures (Which I've done Costa Rica with), Intrepid, Absolute Africa, Oasis, Acacia, among others. For me, I found Nomads to have the best price to what they provide, but definitely do your own research on that. Most camping overland tours are pretty similar, and we ran into some other trucks on the way as well.   


Price: I paid approximately 2k usd for the tour itself. This included most meals, camping in tents and a few hotels, transport in the truck, and a lot of attractions. I also opted for the optional 2 night trip in the Okavango delta instead of the day tour. I will probably talk more about the actual trip in a future post but I definitely enjoyed it. I also got the single supplement. For extra money, you just need money for a couple of the meals not included, snacks on the road, and a few optional activities. You probably don't need a ton of money for misc, but it really depends on what activities you do. For example, if you do skydiving in Swakopmund or helicopter ride in Victoria falls, those can be expensive.  


Demographics: I did the camping tour, they also have an accommodated tour where it's the same tour itinerary, but you say in rooms in the lodges. My camping tour was mostly 20s and 30s, and the accommodated tour group was mostly 40s+. We had 20 people in our camping group, and people were from Korea, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, Slovenia, Canada, US (although the other Americans were all from California), Brazil, and South Africa. I think as the camping group, we definitely bonded more because you are always with each other in the campground, and always helping each other with things if needed.   


Food: All breakfast, most lunches and dinners are included, and it was delicious! Our cook was amazing and he came up with some yummy meals. Breakfast was usually just toast and cereal, sometimes fruit, always with tea and coffee. Occasionally we had time to have a hot breakfast with eggs. Lunch was usually something like sandwiches, burgers, pasta salad, or something like that. Dinners were amazing and could be anything from chicken curry, grilled fish, pasta carbonara, beef stew, Shepard's pie, etc, and there's usually plenty of food for everyone. For water, we all bought two 5-gallon water jugs in town before we left for the desert and we all shared it, so bring a water bottle to refill it. If you drink, we had ample time to buy wine and beer from stores on the way, but it's your own expense.  


Tents: So the tents were pretty annoying to put up/down at the beginning but at the end you get a rhythm going. They are pretty heavy duty (read: heavy) tents that I think every overland tour in Africa uses, so you will be using them whether you do Nomads or not. They are pretty simple to put up, but you do need some muscle to do it, and you will most likely need help putting the metal poles together in the beginning. They are very spacious on the inside and you can probably stand up straight in them.    


Campgrounds: Most of the time you are pitching your tent in a big patch of grass or big sandy area. There are always bathrooms, but some maybe farther than others, and the toilet water pressure may or may not be very good. Showers also vary - sometimes there are no lights in the shower (done many showers with my headlamp on the shelf) or maybe there are no hot water. Some campgrounds may have a pool, wifi, store, etc at the reception but most of the time the campground area is pretty far from the reception area, and it may or may not be worth walking to anyway. Some are larger campground where you might see a few other overland groups at, but some are very remote and small where it's only your group.  


Daily routines: So we usually have an early day. I think probably 80% of the time we either get up somewhere around 5am or 6am. Usually you wake up, get dressed/ready, pack your things in the tent, put down your tent, eat breakfast, put away breakfast, load the truck, and are on your own, usually by 7am. Then we usually drive for a few hours (and usually everyone's asleep on the bus), stop somewhere for lunch, get to new destination campground around afternoon, put up tents, maybe do something afterwards, and then dinner is usually at 7:30.  


Chores: Since this is a participatory camping tour, it is definitely better for you to help out. It makes things go much faster and in a few days everyone has a routine to do. This is key to help everything get done in time since there's so many people. There's no set chore group or anything but people in general just help out whenever it's needed, whether it be dish washing or chopping vegetables or sweeping the truck or helping someone else with their tents or bags.  


What to bring: I went in May, which is the beginning of the winter, but it was still very hot during the day. Bring light breathable clothing but don't bring white because soon it'll be brown, lol. Also bring lots of sunscreen and a hat. Evenings and mornings can be chilly (I found that South Africa and Botswana to have the chilliest nights) so bring a sweater or hoodie for that. You must bring some kind of light since campgrounds aren't always well lighted and you will be putting down your tent in the dark. Plus, you might need light in your tent in the evenings. A headlamp is better than a flashlight so your hands can be free. Wet wipes are also very helpful, and you can always buy them at a local store. It's good for after sweaty hikes, and I also use it every night to wipe my feet before getting into my sleeping bag. Also, you are in Africa so you should bring a camera with a good zoom lens. Some people only had a phone camera but I'd recommend a good zoom camera because you will be able to take pictures that look like you're right next to the animal when you are actually quite far from them. You have to bring a backpack or duffel bag that is squeezable because you have to fit it into your locker. You can also put your daybag under the seat in front of you, as well as above you on the shelves, and there are pockets in front of you for a few things you may use during the day (usually your water bottle, camera/phone, hat/sunscreen, and snacks).   


Random day to day things worth mentioning: There are USB plugs in the truck so you can keep your things charged, sometimes they would bust out but most of the time they worked fine. Occasionally the campgrounds and hotels will have wifi but just as a warning, most of the time the internet are slow and not very stable. Sometimes it will take forever to send a few pictures, so don't expect anything like at home. There is no toilet on the bus but you stop for a bathroom break pretty often, at least every 2 hours. Bathrooms at gas stations and conveniences stores usually charge a small fee (usually 2 Namibian dollars or Botswana Pulas, so between 10-20 cents) but they are usually relatively clean and can flush. Otherwise, you might have to go in the bushes on the side of the road (which they call bushybushy). Definitely bring some tissue with you though, because some bathrooms may not have any. Also, many of them will not have any soap either so hand sanitizer or wet wipes are helpful in that case.  


Would you enjoy an camping overland tour? I think there is a certain type of person that can do this tour and have a great time, but it's definitely not for everyone. You definitely cannot be high maintenance on this tour, if you need to look perfect all the time and need a long time primping in the morning, this is not for you. You will be waking up way early and most likely won't have much time to primp, and you will probably get dirty/dusty/sweaty like everyone else before long. You will get sweaty and hot (there is no AC in the Namibia desert!), you will be covered with dust and dirt, sand will get into your tent, you will be waking up at 5am to put down your tent in the dark, your butt will get numb from the bumpy African roads (Africa massage), your feet will look permanently dirty (because even if you shower, you still have to walk in the sand/dirt to get to your tent), and you will be wearing the same dusty pants day after day, because even if you change into something clean, one day of dealing with the tent will probably make it dusty again. If you don't mind being uncomfortable sometimes, you can see some amazing sights, beautiful scenery, and lots of wildlife and animals. After all, people who spent a lot more money are probably looking at the same things.  


This is everything I can think of about the actual tour company and day to day life in an overland truck. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!","[""Sounds about right.  I've done two multi-week overland truck trips before.  Some long days on the road (10 hrs).  Definitely helps if you get a good group.  Our driver did most of the cooking but we did the prep and cleanup."", '[deleted]', ""Hi! To me, it didn't feel like it was too bad, but even when I travel by myself, I do tend to travel to a lot of places pretty quickly, so the pace was fine for me. If you are the person that like to travel really slowly and stay in places for a long time the pace might seem a bit fast but I think most people thought it was ok. There are definitely drive days, but except a few, most are pretty reasonable, under 5 hours, and you can plenty of breaks for bathrooms, snacks, stretch your legs, or lunch.\n\nThe only thing that was quite a pain is putting up and down the tent every night, and sometimes you get to a site when it's almost dark and you have to put it up, and you often have to put down the tent in the dark at 5-6am, which does get to bit of a pain, esp if you had a drive day and you arrive at the camp and you still have to put up your tent and unpack.\n\nOverall, would I do it again, yes. It was definitely not the most comfortable trip I've done, but you don't do a camping trip in Africa to be comfortable, lol, you do this because you want to experience Africa and see the animals and see the landscapes and not break your budget. Like I've said, it's definitely not for everyone, I can't see anyone high maintenance or need to feel clean and perfect all the time doing it, but it was definitely worth it if you don't mind a little dirty and discomfort in order to see these amazing things.\n\nAlso, feel free to ask me any other questions!""]"

I didn’t realise just how much a lack of sleep could deteriorate both my mental and physical health, I thought I was going crazy!

If I did fall asleep it would only be for 20 minutes or so and the next day I would stay awake and active hoping that in the evening I would finally get a good nights sleep - but it never happened. A thing to note however is that as soon as I got on the plane home i slept for 13 hours straight so maybe my brain was making me not fall asleep as it thought I was in a dangerous situation or something?

161,Have any of my fellow Reddit members gotten a refund from Delta airlines?,11,5jjhf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5jjhf2/have_any_of_my_fellow_reddit_members_gotten_a/,15,1482349178.0,"Hello, and happy holidays! I recently traveled with Delta to Italy. (My flight was on Friday, December 16) The flight was originally supposed to board at 7:15 and depart at 8:15. When I got to the gate the flight was delayed an hour, no big deal. I boarded the plane around 9:15ish, we taxied to the runway and were about to take off when the pilot announced that he had made a mistake and should not have left the gate because the ground/maintenance crew had not signed off on the flight log, due to a broken water valve. We returned to the gate and had to wait on the plane for four plus hours while they repaired the valve. The pilot had no idea what was going on, he informed us it would be a quick fix, then that it was worse then they originally thought, then that we were going to switch aircrafts, and then finally that they were going to remove all of the baggage, to shut off a different valve so the water could not reach the broken valve. Finally after five hours of delay we took off, and I thought ""the worst is behind me, and soon I'll be reunited with my girlfriend and all will be well"" (My girlfriend studied abroad in Florence for the semester) boy was I wrong. We were served a very dissatisfying meal of what they called ""vegetarian lasagna"", I assumed this would be lasagna with only cheese and no meat; however, it was an eggplant lasagna which gave me food poisoning. I spent my first four days in Italy stuck in the hotel room with all of the symptoms that accompany food poising. (I'll spare you the details) Anyways this really put a damper on my trip and ruined my stay in Florence. I am just becoming well enough to eat solid foods again, which really sucks as I was looking forward to enjoying a lot of Italian cuisine. My flight was overpriced due to it being so close to the holiday, $1,300 to be exact. Which for me a 21 year old, full-time college student is a good chunk of cash. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experience getting refunded from Delta or any airline for that matter, and if this would be grounds for a refund. I know to some this will not sound like a big deal, and that I should not complain but it's all relative to my circumstance, being a young, in debt, college student, who had not seen his girlfriend of three years in over four months.

162,Question about flight changes and name matching passport,1,bkofz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bkofz0/question_about_flight_changes_and_name_matching/,3,1557024954.0,"Hey guys, first off posting on mobile so apologies for formatting issues

So I am flying to el Salvador late may, tickets were bought through delta airlines back in October but the flights ended up being changed. So my first flight is DEN-LAX through United airlines, LAX-SAN getting into San Salvador through Avianca. Coming back were taking Avianca going from SAN-DFW (Dallas-FortWorth) and one last flight through American airlines from DFW-DEN

I am now finding out through friends and online searches that if your ticket does not match your full name including your middle name as it shows on your passport you can be denied access into that country. 

Personally my past flights internationally have never had my middle name on them and I have not had an issue but I'm getting all paranoid about this. I called Avianca to choose my seats and ask about this and they told me since the flight was purchased and owned through delta they cannot change any flight information. Okay cool makes sense right? Story gets more interesting. 

I call delta and they tell me that they CAN change the name on the flight but they cannot guarantee I will be able to get the same airspace and that I could lose my flights through UA, AA, and Avianca as they are separate airlines and Delta doesn't control them. Searching online makes it seem like middle name doesn't matter but does anyone have personal experience with this?  Just looking for extra info to put my mind at ease.

Edit: So my buddy and I were able to get American airlines on the phone and change my name to include my middle name. No idea how it was that easy for them as no one else seems able to do this but honestly I'm most worried about international flights from dfw-san and vice versa. Will keep you guys updated","["">  tickets were bought through delta airlines back in October but the flights ended up being changed.

You booked on one carrier, and they changed your flight to being on three carriers, all three of whom are in competing alliances with the original, and two of which are in a competing alliance with the other. Very bizarre. I'd double check this... Is this multiple tickets?\n\n>  Personally my past flights internationally have never had my middle name on them and I have not had an issue but I'm getting all paranoid about this \n\nYeah, ok, why? If you've done this before, is that not enough anecdotal evidence?\n\n> Searching online makes it seem like middle name doesn't matter but does anyone have personal experience with this? \n\nUh...... you do. Why are you still asking?"", ""Buddy here:\nThey had changed the original delta flights to different delta flights. They wouldn't work out so I told delta the changed flights wouldn't work and we wanted in line with our original days and times. They booked these other carriers to match our original request. \n\nJust because it worked for 2 other countries doesn't necessarily verify it will work with every country. \n\nAsking for validation on anecdotal evidence makes it more reliable evidence versus being based on few personal scenarios. Anecdotal evidence is given more validity with supporting statistics."", ""So you need anecdotal evidence on this very specific country? (FYI, SAN = San Diego, not San Salvador).\n\nNone is needed. Middle names shouldn't be an issue with, dare I say, any country in the world, because immigration doesn't go comparing your passport to your boarding pass. Why would they?\n\nIf there is an issue (and I don't think there will be), it would be with the airline or relevant security agency -- you know, people who actually look at the name on your boarding pass and your ticket. Best practice is certainly to put the name on your ticket as written on your ID, but as your research has already shown, middle names typically don't matter. Being denied entry into a country over it though is absolute nonsense.""]"
163,Advice for transiting MCO (Orlando),1,bzd0gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bzd0gz/advice_for_transiting_mco_orlando/,4,1560291269.0,"We live outside Atlanta, and I found a deal that saved us $800 on tickets to London originating in Orlando. I did some research on MCO, and there is a good bit of conflicting information about how much time you should budget for connections. You'll excuse me, I've never been to MCO nor taken an international flight.

The flight is MCO-BOS-LHR (Delta) and it leaves at 1600h. From my research I show it leaves from Airside 2. Some do-able flights from Atlanta arrive around 1330h. The question is if they were to arrive at either Airside 2 or 4 would I have to go back through security to make the next flight. I would assume Airside 2 arrivals I could just walk down to the next gate. For Airside 4 I've seen people say you can just route behind security and take the train to 2, and others say that isn't possible.

It seems that, for around the price I want to pay (at least for the last two months or so), I can either get there with less than three hours between flights if things go well, or I can get up at the crack of dawn and spend eight hours at MCO waiting for the main flight. Both involve stress, one if the plane from Atlanta is delayed, the other leaving home at 0500 on Monday to get to London at 0700 on Tuesday. I could also drive from Atlanta to Orlando, but that involves leaving at around the same time, a 7h drive, and paying for parking for ten days plus a hotel stay when we get back. I think if I'm going to do that, spending 8h in the airport is very slightly winning.

TL;DR - Is a 2.5hr connection time fine at MCO if for some reason I have to go through security?","[""Are you checking bags? Also, there is no way these are the only two flights between Atlanta and Orlando.\n\nEdit: Anyway, as the terminal map on the airport's website shows, Airsides 2 and 4 share a security checkpoint. So they are connected airside. But 2.5 hours leaves little room for error."", ""The plan is to not check anything, but I can't guarantee something won't have to be gate checked. \n\nThose aren't the only two flights, but those are the main times for flights. There are a few that get there in between, but there is a heavy price penalty.\n\nAs for the map, I have seen it myself. But looking back over the years on places where the question has been asked, some have stated they had to get off the airtrain and exit into the terminal area even if they were just going between airsides behind the same security checkpoint.\n\nThere have also been stories about people being held on planes because of how their international arrivals security works. The issue is that all my research has shown stories between 2 and 10 years ago and I'm looking for some recent experiences. If all I have to do is go from one gate to the one next to it, 2.5h is fine if the plane arrives on time.\n\nThe other thing that might be skewing my search results is that people are confusing terminals and airsides in their responses."", ""That's standard in the US for international arrivals, but you aren't doing an international arrival."", 'Their domestic flight was held from disembarking because of an international arrival.

Be sure to click through the other links too.', 'X class is a bulk fare ticket. You were moved up to the next fare bracket because your seat sold and the ticket rpriced to the next available fare. ', ""This takes a little explaining about the way airfares work. \n\nEssentially, there are two different types of classes at work here: classes of travel and fare classes. \n\nIATA, which governs airfares and airlines and ticketing and all of that, has rules on the way airfares are built. Those airfares are what is called full published fares. They're always available, they're the standard the majority of other fares are built upon, but here's the catch: They're expensive. Few people travel on them. These are the fares you'd usually seen sold as being 'fully flexible'. \n\nIn order to get people on to their planes, airlines create other fares, sale fares with lots of restrictions and rules, in order to get people on to their planes to help cover the cost of running the flight. The more loaded with passengers a flight is, the more likely the airline is to cover their running costs. However, there's only three classes of travel upon which published airfares are calculated... so how to sell these discounted sale fares? \n\nWhat the airlines do is they create different fare classes that apply for within the three (or four) classes of travel. So Economy (represented in published fares as Y class) has many different fare classes within it to represent the different sale fare levels. Same with Business (either J or C depending on the airline) and First (either F or P depending on the airline). \n\nCommon fare classes within Economy for sale fares include S, Q, W, O, P, M, B, K, L and X. The exact make up varies from airline to airline. Within Business, sale fares are often in D class. \n\nThe airlines use this to assign how many seats they want to sell on each aircraft at different fare levels. So the published fare might be $1000, but the cheapest sale fare might be $100, but they only want to let 10 people have the $100 fare. The next sale fare might be $200 and 15 seats might be allocated for that fare. It goes on like that through the fares right up till you get to the published level. \n\nSo when you look at a reservation system, every flight will have every fare class available on that plane listed, and a number relating to how many seats are available in that fare class are available (although there's a system limitation there - the most any reservation system will let you book at once is 9 seats, so that's the top number you see, unless you're logged in as the airline). \n\nNow for some examples. Say you're booking one of those Swiss Air round the world airfares - they're great value, right? You have your ticket and the fare is paid. Then you need to change your dates. Your travel consultant tells you the flight you want doesn't have any seats available - but looking at Swiss Air's website, you can see there are, but the flight isn't cheap. The problem? Most of Swiss Air's RTW fares require the seats to be in S class all the way around... but S class is a sale fare, so those seats sell quickly. The fare class you need to keep the fare you're on and not pay extra is not available. (I'm ignoring the presence of change fees in this instance for simplicity's sake.) \n\nAnother example - say you want to go to Thailand and there's a sale on with Thai Airways. You go to book and it says there's only one seat left... but you can see on their website that there's lots, just not at the sale price. Only one at the sale price. Guess what - that's probably W class! And it's the last one they'll sell on that plane. \n\nYet - S class and W class are still in Economy. They're fare classes within a class of travel.\n\nThe airlines simply cannot afford to sell every seat at the cheapest sale price. They'd lose money on every flight if they did. The sale fares do the job of getting people interested and on their planes. Sometimes you get lucky. Other times you don't. It all depends upon availability, which is very unpredictable. \n\nWhen it comes time for your flight, you might have paid $250 for your seat. The person next to you might have paid $1100. Maybe they needed flexibility with their travel dates, or maybe they only booked last night. \n\nSale fares are all about availability, and that is first come, first served.\n\nSo - that's how it works in terms of what airlines call yield management. How airfare rules themselves work, that's a different story! "", '[deleted]', 'AHHH that would drive me insane!

Hi everyone!  My S.O and I are trying to plan a three week trip to Asia this summer but have no clue what we are doing. This is the plan I came up with but am not sure if it's any good. 

Our plan is -   
Fly into Singapore on May 30th and spend a week.  
Fly to Ho Chi Minh city, spend 4 days  
Fly to Hanoi and spend 3 days.   
Fly to Bangkok and spend 7 days (the hotel stay was gifted to us, so this is the most non-negotiable one)

Does this look okay? We are massively city people who are mainly looking for shopping, nightlife, food, and easy access to day-trips.

Also, with this itinerary, we have about $800 of spending money AFTER flights AND hotels. There are two of us.

178,"First international travel, looking forward to everything but the flight",3,b5qkmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/b5qkmy/first_international_travel_looking_forward_to/,16,1553640377.0,"COS: USA Six months out from travel.

Going to be 40 this year, and have been dreaming about this trip for over 20 years. Finally applied for my passport, and we have flats picked out in London and Paris. We know what we want to do, so no, AutoModerator, we aren't looking for advice for London or Paris.

My hangup is the flight.

I haven't flown much in my life, less than ten total flights. I have a bit of a height issue (I wouldn't call it fear), and I don't like not being in control. The safety record is well known to me, but still it persists. There's two areas that I could use some advice/feedback on.

**Comfort:** It takes a perfect scenario for me to get to sleep. I am a stomach sleeper, as much as I've tried to change that. I doubt I will be getting much sleep sitting up in a cramped seat, but I am trying out ANC headphones, pillows, etc now to see what might assist. I am of average height, so legroom isn't a huge deal. I'm not thin, but I also don't come close to overflowing  the confines of my seat. The more I can't fall asleep, the more anxious I get about falling asleep and it cascades. All the flights from Atlanta to London are overnight, which works for our itinerary, but I'm worried I will be a mess trying to function even until dinner time. The only other overnight flight I've taken was from SFO-ATL, and I slept perhaps thirty minutes. It wasn't very fun.

**Cost:**The above dovetails into price. I can find RT tix ATL-LHR for about $650 ($1300 for both of us) in lowest level economy via a third party off Skyscanner. Now, I've seen plenty of advice that says to book with the airline, but that bumps it up to $890pp. I could then upgrade off that if I care to. Premium Economy is running roughly double my original $650pp ticket. Is some more legroom worth double? Is being able to select your seat worth $110? We're hoping to travel light, just a carry on bag for us each.

I just have no frame of reference to know if the $650pp deal is good, to not buy third party, and if it's worth double to change from Economy Basic to Premium Economy (the carrier I am basing all this off of is BA, but it seems to be the same for Delta, et al). Since we've never really traveled, we have no loyalty, points, or anything other than currency to use. We hope this is the beginning of the second half of our lives traveling more, but we are starting basically from scratch. In a similar manner, I have no idea which airlines and which planes are better than others, only that a ton of people are not impressed with United.

I appreciate you reading this.","['You are fine booking with a third party site, I do it all the time. \n\n International flights are different than domestic.  You have your little TV in the chair, watch 4 movies and you are there...or have a few drinks and sleep.  $650 seems like an alright deal, I am sure you might be able to find better, I am also sure that you can find worse.  There is a whole sidebar on deals, and it sounds like you know what you are doing.\n\nTLDR: get shit faced on flight and watch a few movies, have a great trip.', ""Congrats on the next part of your life!  Happy voyages.\n\nSo, I  usually get the Redeye to Britain/Ireland.  As I've gotten older, I feel the jet lag more, so my first day is spent in the hotel, in a half-stupor, or in a rental car with a rented driver.\nI prefer spending it in the hotel, however, taking it slow, reading brochures or watching local TV.\n\nI have noticed a slight difference between basic Economy and Business (first) Class travel; anything in between I wouldn't bother with, but you can check out more on travel Forums.\n\nYeah, United has hired some crazy- scary people who've done crazy things.  But I've flown them with no problem.\nAs far as Airlines go, check out airlineratings.com.\n\nhttps://www.airlineratings.com/news/worlds-best-airlines-2019/\n\nIt takes awhile to get the circadian rhythm back, and I'm 5 hrs behind for about 2 1/2 days!  I  find walking helps, so sightseeing is preferable.\n\nI personally would save my $ on any kind of coach upgrade, unless it's a lie-flat business class seat, which is more comfortable for your body to stretch out for a couple of hours, but doesn't help with sleep at all IMO.\n\nYou mentioned you're 40 now ; I'd recommend wearing compression socks.  They really make a difference getting up & walking off the plane after no leg movement for 6-7 hrs!\nPlus, you're more prone to blood clots now.  They take up literally no room in your carry-on ; you can put them on at the gate.\n\nSay Hi to London for me!\n"", ""You'll be ok in Economy and it's a not-so-bad 8hr flight. ANC headphones, eyeshades, and a drink generally get me about 3-4 hrs of sleep. Meals and a couple of movies and you'l be there in no time.\n\nDon't forget to get up and stretch.\n\nAs far as deals go, look, if you're happy with the price and it fits well within your budget then stop looking at prices after you book.  There'll always be someone who will claim you paid too much or that they got  a dirt cheap price. Google flights will you a range of prices based on the dates in/around your travel dates so if you can adjust and get the best price then do so.\n\nWhen you check in online, you may be offered an upgrade to Premium economy  for much less than if you booked it originally so you can decide whether it's worth it then. IMO, it may be worth considering on 10+ hr flights, otherwise it's Econ or Business."", ""Be careful of the lowest level or basic economy tickets. They are cheap but they have several disadvantages. They often don't include the cost of a checked bag which can be $50pp each way. That's already another $200 assuming one bag a person each way. The basic economy tickets also limit you to a personal item only on the plane, no standard carry-on so you'll be stuck paying to check your luggage Finally, basic economy tickets you don't get to choose your seat, so that cheap ticket you could get stuck in in a center seat with no guarantee you won't be separated from your spouse. \n\nAs for sleeping on the plane, forget about it unless you take something. I fly internationally 3 or 4 times a year and almost always fly first/business where the seats fold down into actual beds and still can't sleep without chemical assistance, let alone trying to sleep in coach. Just plan your first day to stay awake at your destination until you should normally go to sleep and you'll be fine. As for Premium Economy, what that really gets you is a little extra leg room. Is it worth the extra money? Well, depends what you value more, nobody can make that decision for you. \n\nFinally, be careful booking on third party OTA (online travel agents) websites. They control your ticket until the day  you fly. So if you need to change, or have a problem you have to call your OTA and make changes, you can't deal directly with the airline. Also, OTAs might book you on separate itineraries which has consequences if you miss one of your connections you could lose your ticket. If you're doing one direct flight that won't be an issue but watch out for codeshare flights and itineraries booked on separate PNRs. Your best bet is to always book directly with airlines, unless you're that price conscious that $200 is going to make or break you.\n\n"", 'You get what you pay for. If you want to sleep on the flight, take drugs. ', 'Jumped in and bought the airline tickets. Thanks for all the advice.\n\nEnded up doing Main Cabin on Delta from Orlando for less than what I stated above (first party), just have to get to Orlando when the date comes.', 'All of this, plus ask your doc for a small Ambien prescription, and be sure to bring a sleep mask.  ', ""No, $200 isn't going to break a $4000+ trip. At the same time, with two tickets that is 10% of the trip potentially. Or 30% more for the exact same seat. It's just hard mentally to justify it, although I know it comes with some additional assurances the ticket won't have unforeseen issues. This is advice that I asked for, so I do appreciate it.\n\nI'm starting to look at Delta, because apparently they have a miles deal with Airbnb, which is nice. Unfortunately even upgrading and paying more for Main cabin won't allow me to be eligible for any further upgrades.  I'd be looking at either $1782 or $2002, with the only discernible difference in being I get to pick my seats. Both are identical otherwise.\n\nI guess my next step is to see if we come out cheaper flying from NY, Boston, or Philly and look at flights to those cities. I could do Delta Comfort+ from NY for $1500. I suppose I still have more research to do."", 'Hello, I bought a econony ticket from skyscanner with Exploretrip.

I didn't realize it was the OTA telling you it was $50 and not the airline, the $50 sounds like a cash grab from a sketchy OTA. I have heard that the sketchier sites do like to call back and confirm you exist before issuing a ticket, so it's not unusual they called you. \n\n$1200CAD still sounds like a good price for YUL-SGN. I'm glad you called China Air to verify your ticket was booked. I recommend a week before your flight you call and confirm again or go to their website and you can check your ticket to make sure it's valid. You don't want to shop up at the airport and have no ticket. \n\nSafe travels\n"", 'thanks will do! ']"

My boyfriend and I are planning a trip to Italy this fall. I’d love your thoughts on our high-level itinerary. I want to make sure we have our days spaced where they should be. Nothing is booked yet so we can edit this as needed. 

Arrive Friday, 9/27 @ 10 AM in Rome 
9/27 - 9/30: Rome
10/1: travel to Amalfi and stop @ Pompeii
10/2 - 10/4: Amalfi area
10/5: travel to Florence
10/5 - 10/7: Florence/Tuscany
10/8: depart from Florence @ noon to head home 


A few notes:
- we are mid to late 20s and don’t mind packing a lot into our days at each location 
- experienced international travelers 
- some Italian proficiency 
- I’ve never been to Italy, and my boyfriend had not been since he was a kid 

A secondary concern (if anyone had experience in this area) is this: to get to Rome, we are traveling Raleigh to Atlanta, and then Atlanta to Rome. Both flights are Delta, but it’s only a 45 min layover in Atlanta. Is this cutting it to close?

You'll most likely leave out of Terminal F, which will be a different terminal than you arrive in to in Atlanta (probably B or C terminal). Just get off your flight and take the underground train to your departure to Roma. They will probably be boarding your flight or at least checking passports, but if you're on time, you can get to your gate, maybe use the restrooms, and then be ready to board.

My departure is tomorrow (within 24 hours). When I tried to check in online, I noticed my selected seat for returned flight (mid Feb) was removed, and it doesn't give me option to select seat. I call delta, hold the line for 2.5 hours already and no sign it will be my turn any time soon.

I am just curious does it happened to you ""after you already select seat, it's get removed and you didn't get any notification""? are you aware if a customer purchase a higher class tier ticket have more privilege so they can cancel my seat?

Edit: finally got hold of Delta rep. She said 31F doesn't exist. I tried to explain to her, I chose that seat for return flight when booking the ticket, and I saw the seat in the seat map as I spoke (it just grey out, as most of the seat).

183,Our airline got us on 2 impossible flights after our first delayed flight; What to do?,6,bivbj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bivbj3/our_airline_got_us_on_2_impossible_flights_after/,3,1556603769.0,"&#x200B;

 Saturday, April 27th, we had our American Airlines flight (executed by British Airways) to London Heathrow, where we had our connecting flight to JFK by American Airlines. Due to Weather conditions (They said so), our flight got delayed, so we couldn’t make it on our second flight to JFK (This flight even departed earlier). We were told to go to the connections desks, which after a long wait told us we had to stay at a hotel and leave the next morning to catch our rebooked Lufthansa flight to Frankfort (FRA). Here we had another connecting flight to JFK from Delta. When we arrived slightly late at Frankfurt Airport we ran to catch our next Delta flight. We didn’t even had the Check-in tickets yet; this caused us to never make in in time and we yet again got us rebooked at a British Airways Helpdesk. At the end, all 4 of us would split up in 2 groups to still arrive at JFK in the evening of Sunday, we insisted in doing it, as our last hope. We went as fast as we could to the Lufthansa Helpdesk to get our tickets, but they said the information provided by British Airways was not complete and the time period was way to narrow to still make the flight. After this huge disappointment we decided to cancel our trip, since our 5 days at New York would turn to 3, which just wouldn’t made it worth it.

With our already more than 24 hours delay, our airline clearly made some big mistakes. Off course we cannot help the first delay (since weather conditions), but getting rebooked twice on flights that were impossible to make (the Lufthansa helpdesk employee that tried to get our tickets confirmed this) is just not right. Now I wondered who is responsible for the mistakes made on our flights; American Airlines or British Airlines and what would be possible in terms of claims or other solutions.

They were actually really good about finding us a new flight (after I forced them to check partner airlines and ones with seats together etc) but what you went through sounds awful!!

185,[Question] Itinerary advice for a 2-week Vietnam trip,1,bk1zwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bk1zwe/question_itinerary_advice_for_a_2week_vietnam_trip/,6,1556870557.0,"Hi,

6 guys going to Vietnam here. We're all quite young and want to see as much of Vietnam as possible in our time. Our tickets are booked to land in Ho Chi Minh on the 13th June and leaving from Hanoi on the 28th. Our current itinerary is looking something like this:



12th: Late flight landing in HCMC at 1am

13th: Explore city, arrange to get some clothes tailored and picked up or sent to us.

14th: Mekong Delta Tour

15th: Cu Chi Tunnels

16th: Travel to Da Nang, Golden Bridge & Da Nang Beach

17th: Hue day visit

18th: From Da Nang, travel to and explore Hoi An & stay the night

19th: Explore Hoi An and return to Da Nang in the evening

20th: Travel from Da Nang to Hanoi

21st: Relax in Hanoi, enjoy the nightlife

22nd: Explore Hanoi some more

23rd-24th: 2-Day tour to Sapa Hills

25th-26th: HaLong Bay (1 night, 2 days)

27th: Hanoi Food tour and packing

28th: Flight back home



I feel like there is a lot of room to explore and go beyond Hanoi between the 21st and 28th.

* I'd love to explore places such as Phang Nha National Park, do you have any suggestions for beautiful nature spots like this that might be within our reach?

* I've also done some research and seen that Cat Ba island is a good alternative to Halong Bay or that Halong Bay is not worth it, any opinions on this?

* Currently we just plan to stay at AirBnBs/hostels at the places we are visiting, and travelling from Da Nang to Hanoi by plane. I've seen sleeper trains are available, given our tight schedule do you think these will allow us to visit some more spots?

* My main concern is missing out on some beautiful spots or not making the most use of our time. Open to any suggestions to alter our plan. As long as it starts in HCMC and ends in Hanoi, we're open to anything!

Thanks!","['Ha Long Bay is incredible (do a 2 night cruise if you can so you can spend a full day on the water). Sapa is also amazing - see if you can do an overnight homestay.

If we visit again, I'd do food tours in both Saigon and Hanoi - they're cheap and the value added with a local guide is worth it.  You might consider doing your food tours on arrival day so that you can benefit from the experience afterwards.   I'd also consider taking a day or two from the big cities and squeeze in a visit to Dalat.  Dalat was recommended to us by one of our guides.  Saigon/Hue/Da Nang were HOT in March.  Dalat is at approx. 4,500 ft. elevation so the temps are much cooler and would be a nice change of pace.

&#x200B;

Some details:

\-Both airlines operate from the same terminal (T1), at least that's what I read online

\-I'm only bringing carry-on luggage

\-On Google Flights it states that the EasyJet flight is typically delayed by 30 minutes

\-My planned arrival in Lisbon is a bit time sensitive because it's the first day of summer university program I'm enrolled in.

We live nearest to the DC metro area so we can fly BWI, IAD, DCA or potentially even PHI if it's a good enough deal. We have both traveled in Europe but not extensively. A big part of me thinks we need to go to some place in Asia (such as Tokyo) just because we have so much time to take and the $800 vouchers are not something we'd normally have to defray the cost of what is normally a pretty expensive flight. At the same time neither of us have been to Spain so that is also an attractive option (but it is so much closer than Asia and usually not too expensive so I am debating whether this is the right trip to use our vouchers on).

We waited additional 1.5 hours for the new crew, which did exactly the same. I was pissed off when they said that it will take at least 100 minutes before the plane is defroasted, and then, after 90 minutes they said they have to bring us back to the gate. So why did we have to stay there for these 90 minutes, if they knew from the beginning that they won't be able to take off?

American is in the middle.\n\nBut really, as was mentioned, you're going to want to look into basing it on where you fly.

I myself prefer to shell out a bit of extra money for a more comfortable flying experience."", 'Something else to note, Delta is tied to American Express which is not that popular in Europe.

From Philadelphia, a nonstop flight on American would be more desirable than a connecting flight on Delta, so Delta may offer a lower fare in order to get people to choose them over a nonstop on American. But American probably won't let Delta's fares get too much lower because the bigger the difference, the more likely people will choose a connecting flight to save money."", 'Everyone should have at least one membership in all three major alliances', ""> Basically Delta is probably the best airline with the worst loyalty program while United is the worst airline with the best program.

next saturday I fly out of orlando(Spirit-- 8:15a)  land in in fort lauderdale(9:20a)  and then leaves at (Spirit--10:30a) for cancun 

On the way back I leave cancun (Aeromexico/delta--7:45a) land in atlanta(11:18a) , then my flight to orlando takes off at (Delta--12:55a).

When i fly out of orlando, do i have to go through the international security line? how does that work since ill just be swapping terminals in FLL THEN leaving the country?

Also,  i know that in atlanta ill have to hit customs which is fine, ill only have a backpack and small carry on and dont really plan on bringing anything back.

205,Help Redeeming Delta Vouchers Needed.,2,6ac7xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6ac7xw/help_redeeming_delta_vouchers_needed/,3,1494445153.0,"My wife and I want to do some traveling with vouchers we got last year for volunteering to take a later plane. We earned 6 vouchers, including our 4 children, for $800 each. 

(I know now to ask for cash instead of vouchers. Any chance we could still make that happen? I'm guessing not.)

I'm trying to book a trip for my wife and I to Hawaii using our vouchers and one of the kids. The kids are not going with us on this trip and technically, the vouchers are not transferable. Since the kids are not traveling with us I was told we'd have to pay the $300+ extra to make the trip happen. I'll do that if I have to but I wanted get more info before I call back to confirm everything. 

Is there anything I can say or do to convince Delta to accept the kid's vouchers for our trip? 

Other info: We've already used some of the credits earlier this year. When we booked that trip and when we first accepted the bump/vouchers we asked about transferring. Both times we were told they can probably make that happen. There's more than enough to make this trip happen and the vouchers expire in July. If we can book this trip we'll still be leaving about $500 in unused vouchers on the table, if that matters. 

Any help you can offer is appreciated.

**Trip Length**

5 weeks. 5 days in Cape Town solo, 28 day tour with G Adventures.

**Flights**

Australia to Cape Town/Johannesburg via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Whilst Singapore Airlines is a great airline, the food portions were very small on the SIA-JNB/CPT legs which seemed to be a common complaint online as well. Will try and get a sale with Qantas next time.

**Budget**

Flights - AUD$1600

Cape Town accomodation - A$1000

Tour - A$3600

Spending money - approx A$1500

**Cape Town**

Stayed in the Silo District at the V&A Waterfront. Considerably cheaper than the hotels within the original V&A Waterfront with the same access to location etc. Whilst incredibly touristy, the waterfront is well lit with security presence that makes you feel that bit safer in the evening especially as a solo female. 

I used Kiff Kombi Tours for a day trip to Cape of Good Hope and Boulders Beach and a separate ""Urban Tour"" of Cape Town. Would highly recommend. They also had a Street Art Township tour available that looked quite good.

Also used the Hop On Hop Off buses to travel to Table Mountain, Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, Camps Bay and Groot Constantia. No complaints about the service, though it is a one way loop so plan your day accordingly.

Uber was highly recommended by locals as a much safer alternative to taxis. 

I felt completely safe in Cape Town and would highly recommend visiting it.

**The Tour**

[Cape Town, Falls & Kruger Adventures](https://www.gadventures.com.au/trips/cape-town-falls-kruger-adventure/DATJ/)

So this one of G Adventure's 18-39 range. It's capped at 22 people, and the tour was full for the entire trip. Mix of British, Canadian, America, Australia, Swiss, German and Scandinavians. Everyone was great at speaking English in a group setting. It is also a participatory camping tour - you put up/take down your own tents, work together to unpack/pack and set up and camp, assist with food prep (basic chopping etc) and dishes. Keeps the costs down, and wasn't a hardship at all. 

G Adventures also sells the trip in separate segments - Cape Town to Windhoek, Cape Town to Victoria Falls, Windhoek to Victoria Falls and Victoria Falls to Johannesburg. We kept the same guides/vehicle and majority of the group for the Cape Town to Victoria Falls segment. A few people left in Windhoek and were replaced by the same number. Once in Victoria Falls the majority of the group finished their trip there with some people continuing on to East Africa with new guides and a few of us continuing on to Johannesburg with a new group. The majority of the group we joined in Victoria Falls were doing a 2 week loop from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls and back again. There was also a few people that had come from East Africa and continuing on to Johannesburg. Quite a few people weren't expecting the change in group/guides but it is clearly stated on the website that this will occur. 

All camping equipment was supplied aside from sleeping bags and pillows. Was very surprised with the thickness and comfort of the mattresses supplied. Tents big enough to fit 2 people and bags without being on top of each other. We had heavy rain one night with no issues with belongings inside the tent getting wet. Tent dried out quite well at the next campsite, despite packing the tent up in pouring rain that morning. Easy enough to put up/take down in 5 minutes. 

The ""Lando""/bus/truck that we used was also quite comfortable. Each seat had a USB charger which was great for charging on the road. No issues with the first bus, but half the chargers on the second bus didn't work. We were only that one for 6 days so wasn't a huge drama, but would have been annoying had we been going for any longer. Wifi on board is also advertised on the website, but it never worked. There also wasn't really that much reception even if the router was working. Some issues with the A/C breaking down a few times but was fixed that afternoon by the driver. Keep in the mind that the website (and associated promises) is written by the marketing department which based in Canada. Overland trips in Africa take a huge toll on the buses with bumpy roads, long drives and lots of dust. The ""photography friendly"" top windows also advertised on the website didn't open, but no issues taking photos out of the normal windows. 

Majority of the meals are included, usually not included when in towns/accomodation. Cooking and food provided was great and couldn't complain. No one went hungry. 

The guides we had were amazing (2 in each segment, 4 in total).

**South Africa Day 1-3**

Tour kicks off in Cape Town with a meeting in the evening and leaves the following morning. Make sure to book extra time if you want to see more of Cape Town. The first 2 days are mainly driving with a stop at cultural centre on the first day and a night spent at a winery. Day 3 is spent at the Orange river on the South African/Namibian border with the option to go rafting or swimming in the river. Long drives are unfortunately essential to get to places. Enough bathroom/snack stops. 

**Namibia - Day 4-14**

Majority of the trip was spent in Namibia. Another couple of long driving days for Day 4 and Day 5. Crossed the border on day 4 and visited Fish River Canyon on Day 4 for sunset which was stunning. Swimming pools at both of these campsites which were well received with heat.

Day 6 it was finally time for some activities. Climbed Dune 45 in the Namib Desert and explored Deadsvlei a salt pan with petrified trees. Stinking hot, keep up the water. As someone used to tropical humid heat, I didn't find the dry heat much of an issue. People from colder countries struggled a bit more. Afternoon drive to our campsite where we did an optional Living Desert tour into the desert to learn about how animals and plants actually grow out there. Highlight of day watching zebras come to drink from a lit watering hole in the evening only 20m away from us. 

Day 7, 8 and 9 were spent in a hostel in Swakopmund. Arrived in the afternoon in day 7 and left lunch time on Day 9. Lots of optional activities available - sky diving, dune buggying, sandboarding etc. 

Day 9 was onto Spitzkoppe and was 1 of 2 campsites where we wouldn't have running water available. We had a 250L tank in the bus available for hand washing, cooking and dishwashing and long drop toilets. Wasn't an issue. Stunning landscapes in that area.

Day 10 was some more driving and a stop at a ""Living Museum"" to learn about the culture of the local Damara people. Optional visit to some cave paintings as well - I opted to stay at camp and chill.

Day 11, 12 and 13 was Etosha National Park (hurrah!!!). We camped inside the National Park with a flood lit watering hole a few minutes walk from the campsite to sit and watch animals come at night. We arrived in the afternoon and saw some giraffes and zebras on the drive in. G Adventures includes 2 game drives on the full day in Etosha - but its done in the bus. I opted to do a morning game drive in a 4x4 (was A$80) and was well worth it. Could get much closer to the animals in the 4x4. We still saw quite a bit from the bus, but was sometimes hard to get good sight of the animals because of the logistics of a large bus and 22 people compared to a 4x4 with 10 people. Saw lions, giraffes, zebras, and lots of other game in Etosha. Spotted some black rhino's at the watering hole at night. 

Day 13 we headed to Windhoek (arrived late afternoon) and left early the following morning.

**Botswana**

Day 14 was another border crossing and a campsite in the Kalahari Desert. Optional walk with some local San Bushmen which was quite interesting and entertaining.

Day 15 drove to Maun - optional scenic flight over the Okavango Delta. Was US$100 and I found well worth it. Didn't really know what a Delta was until we flew over. Spotted quite a few animals. The planes are small (we flew in a 4 seater) and hot! Would definitely recommend taking some prophylactic travel calm before flying as a few people spewed mid flight.

Day 16/17 was an overnight excursion into the Okavango Delta. Absolute highly of the trip. Met up with a local company who transported us (and all our gear) in mokoros (dugout canoes) to an island in the Delta. Spotted hippo's on the way and some elephants soon after arriving at camp. This was the 2nd of our camps with no running water and it was complete wild camping, with a freshly dug hole for the toilet. An afternoon walk to see some zebras and more elephants and then back to Maun in the morning. Then off to our next campsite (also with a pool - the majority had pools and bars) and a number of elephants spotted along the highway.

Day 18/19 was in Chobe National Park. Optional river cruise (which everyone did) in the afternoon along the Chobe river where we saw tonnes of elephants, hippos and buffalo and then an optional safari drive the following morning which again everyone did. Was $80USD for both. Highlights of the safari drive were lion cubs and a leopard. A note on the optionals - I noted a few complaints online about there being so many optional activities on top of the tour price. The itinerary states these clearly along with the price and you do have the option to pre-book and pre-pay when booking the tour. Being in the ""budget range"" I understand why they don't want to include all the optionals as it will make the overall price significantly higher - but I do think the river cruise and safari in Chobe should have been included as the only other option would have been to sit at camp and not see anything. 

**Zimbabwe**

Day 19 another border crossing to Zimbabwe and then to Victoria Falls. We had 2 full days in Victoria Falls which was plenty I found. I went to Devils Pool on the Zambian side and did a helicopter scenic flight. Others went white rafting, bungee jumping etc. Great campsite with restaurant, pool etc. Day 20 and 21 also spent in Victoria Falls.

Day 22 it was off with the new group to Matobo National Park in Zimbabwe. Another long driving day. 

Day 23 was an included trip to Matobo National Park to see some rhino's. Another highlight of trip as you get to do a walking safari and we got quite close to the White Rhino's. 

**South Africa**

Day 24 crossed the border back into South Africa. Another great campsite with pools and a playground (never too old for a playground at a campsite!). Relatively long day mainly due to spending a couple of hours at the border. 

Day 25 and 26 were in Kruger National Park. Day 25 we drove through Kruger in our bus to a campsite in the middle and day 26 we went in 4x4's to the next campsite outside Kruger (again an optional not included). Got incredibly lucky on the first day and saw a large number of animals in the middle of the day due to it being quite overcast. Spotted the Big 5 again whilst in Kruger - tonnes of elephants, zebra, giraffes, hippos, lions getting stuck into a fresh kill and another leopard. 

Day 27 was another 7 hour drive back to Johannesburg. The accomodation used is quite far out of the city and 10 mins from airport. The tour finished the following morning and I flew out that morning so didn't see anything of Johannesburg. Other people did a day tour throughout the city, and if having extra days there I would definitely book separate accomodation closer in the city.

**Overall**

I had an absolutely amazing experience and would highly recommend the trip, especially for those looking to do Africa on a bit of a budget. However be prepared for long driving days, having to pitch in and help out and for things to not go entirely to plan all of the time.

G Adventures used to have their own forum which was really helpful, but since they closed it down it can be quite hard to find info out there.\n\nSing out if you’ve got any questions.', 'Awesome! I’m hoping to do that trip next year!\n\nNext time I’d definitely do a second 4x4 game drive in Etosha - but given that you’ve got a lot more wildlife spotting opportunities in Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya you might be happy to just do the included one in the bus.\n\nI wish I’d gone out to the rock paintings in Damaraland (was an optional in the afternoon after visiting the Living Museum) - I was hot and tired and didn’t really realize what they were at the time. I think the ones they go to are actually quite impressive/famous.\n\nProbably didn’t need to do the extended version of the Vic Falls helicopter tour, but definitely cool to see it from the air. I’d be keen to go rafting next time as well.\n\nPack light. Packing and repacking in a tent is a pain and the less you have to repack the easier it is. Laundry was limited on the Cape Town to Vic Falls leg - apparently there’s more options to get it done on the Vic Falls to Nairobi section. I just hand washed every few days (I used a Scrubba bag and laundry concentrate). I packed mainly athletic tops, sports bras and quick dry shorts which made washing and drying easily. Take a rope or something you can use as a clothesline. Would also recommend a Turkish towel or similar as opposed to microfibre or a normal one. Mine dried very quickly and didn’t smell. You really only need a pair of flip flops and a pair of closed in shoes. You’ll want something a bit more substantial for the gorilla trekking in Uganda, but a pair of trainers is more than enough for the part that I went on.\n\nDon’t forget a headlamp and spare batteries. Baby wipes are a godsend. Definitely take an external battery pack to keep things charged when not in the bus. Take more camera memory cards then what you think you’ll need.\n\nWould suggest taking a bottle opener and a marker pen to label your drinks for when they go into the communal cooler. One guide had a pen for us to use the others didn’t.\n\nYou can go light on toiletries. Certainly between Cape Town and Vic Falls we stopped at a supermarket at least every 2-3 days and there was always a variety of toiletries available. Might not be brands you’re used to, but you’ll be able to get shampoo/deodorant/soap easily.\n\nGuides were fantastic. They were from South Africa, Namibia and Kenya. 2 guides at a time. They were all a bit different in how they approached things and definitely some cultural differences noted, but overall were really good.\n\nDevil’s Pool we had booked for us when we started the trip. There was a bit of a “phoning a friend” involved I think by our guide to get 12 spots for us at relatively shortish notice but it happened! The accommodation you stay at in Vic Falls arranges transfers and border crossing all for you so it’s very easy.\n\nI’d also recommend a Kindle or e-reader. You spend a lot of time driving, and it’s also nice to sit and read whilst chilling at a campsite. Definitely download far more music/books/movies/tv shows on to your phone/tablet whatever than what you think you’ll need before you go. WiFi is crap. I was able to download some more books onto my Kindle at the Windhoek accomodation, but could never get decent enough WiFi to download more Spotify playlists after I got sick of the ones I already had. WiFi was enough to post photos to social media though.', '> Interesting about the change of guides in Vic Falls, though the company that I used offers similar split trips as well (I had the same people/truck/guide the entire trip).\n\nYeah it was interesting how they did it. Our original guides/bus went back to Cape Town (so 6 weeks on the road for them) with some people that had come from Nairobi and then new people. We joined guides/bus that had done the 3 weeks down from Nairobi, did 1 week to Joburg with them and then they were doing Joburg back to Vic Falls through Botswana and then back to Nairobi (so I think 8 weeks on the road total) and the others from our group that were continuing onto Nairobi joined the guides/bus that had just come from Joburg and were now on there way back to Nairobi.', '>Also, how did you pick G adventures as opposed to other Africa overlanding tours\n\nI’ve used them in the past and was very happy with them. Also wanted the newer bus and age restricted group.\n\n> How does the meals work\n\nIt’s mainly cereal and yoghurt (if available for breakfast). Occasionally a hot breakfast if time (keep in mind you’re usually leaving between 6–8am). Like for example whilst we climbed Dune 45 our guide made a hot breakfast.\n\nLunch is usually sandwiches again occasionally something like rice salad, cooked lunch of time permits.\n\nThe guides choose what to cook based on availability of foods and just get you to chop things etc. Generally a mix of things like pastas, wraps, stews etc. Something that can be made for 24 people on a 2 burner camp stove. Our guides did make us some recipes from their family. There was also a few meals included cooked by local people.\n\n>Next, the truck - how comfortable is it? How roomy is each seat\n\nI’m 5”10 and had no issues sitting next to my similar height friend. You can slide the seats out a little bit into the aisle. Don’t get motion sickness so can’t comment on that. You rotate seats everyday, but if you need to sit up front so you didn’t vomit then it wouldn’t be an issue.\n\n> how often are you able to access any connection for small things like emails, browsing, or social media?\n\nUsually 2-4 days. It might be somewhere random like a supermarket.\n\n>Also, is it pretty easy to stay plugged in at the campgrounds for electronics - cameras, laptops, tablets, etc - esp if the Lando usb ports might not work?\n\nNot really. The lando would plug in at night (as long as it was a powered campsite) and had actual power plugs as well that you could plug into.\n\nI would take a battery pack or two to keep the essentials like camera charged.', '> G Adventures used to have their own forum which was really helpful, but since they closed it down\n\nThey closed it down because it was getting full of dis-satisfied customers complaining.  For a while they were silently deleting those posts, but eventually the volume of complaints grew so much that it was very obvious what was going on.\n\nG Adventures has a rather spotty safety record.  There was a tour that they ran (in reality, sub-contracted to a different tour company) in Peru a few years ago, where the boat caught on fire.  None of the smoke detectors on the boat worked, crew had to come around pounding on doors, and everyone had to be evacuated off the boat in the middle of the night.

That was really the only attempt at an answer I got.

Well today came and when I got off the DL 645 there was no bag here in Mexico.

Four days into a 16 day trip to Europe (from the US West Coast), my wife’s mother passed away. 
- Delta got us on an Air France code share flight to Boston, for minimal fare increase and waived the change fees, without a death certificate. 
- Airbnb fully refunded the unused, non-refundable expenses from our anticipated stay in Switzerland (with a death certificate) and followed up a few weeks later with an impressive basket of Lindt Chocolates and a nice letter to go with it. 

The letter:

**Full version:**
We had our end of summer trip planned and set to go back in April. We were traveling from the SF Bay Area to Germany, followed by Austria, Switzerland and France before heading back to Deutschland, to fly home. Original air travel was on Delta, round trip. We had Airbnb reservations set for Austria and Switzerland and had decided to figure out France (also via Airbnb), once we arrived in Europe and determined what areas of France we wanted to travel to. We were leaning towards Lyon and Strasbourg.

Our first morning in Salzburg, we received word that my wife’s mother passed away. We then went into get back to the US mode and contacted Delta to figure out how to get to the US East Coast. The agent was quite helpful and ultimately set us up on a flight, from Germany, to Boston via Paris on Air France. The fair increase was about $200pp USD, which I considered nominal, given the short notice and the day we needed to fly.  

I then contacted our host for the Airbnb reservation in Switzerland, just outside of Lucerne, and informed him of the circumstance and I would need to cancel. The cancelation policy was 5 days prior and this happened two days before the reservation. I expected the financial hit and left it at that. 

Once in Boston, as the fog of the situation started to settle, I started looking into the amount of funds I was going to lose via the Airbnb reservation and cancellation policy and came across a clause about Extenuating Circumstances. Contacted Airbnb and received a reply a couple days later, with a request for the death certificate. Sent that in one evening and before we awoke the next morning, I had a message indicating they refunded the full amount. Albeit somewhat surprised, I thought this was a good thing and they were customer oriented. 

But then the unexpected – Fast forward about three weeks later. This past Friday evening, after arriving home from work, I had a UPS box on the doorstep, which contained the basket of chocolates from Airbnb. This was a really nice gesture and my wife was especially touched. I work for a mid-sized, employee owned management consulting firm and we have a vested interest in paying attention to the value we deliver to our clients and the level of customer service we provide. We believe it makes a difference.

230,Beach near Ho Chi Minh City to unwind on?,3,an5sqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/an5sqb/beach_near_ho_chi_minh_city_to_unwind_on/,15,1549340246.0,"Hi fellow travellers!

I will be flying into Hanoi, spending just over 3 weeks exploring the country, and flying home out of Ho Chi Minh City.

I want to preemptively book some sort of a beach hut near Ho Chi Minh city, so that I have a place already booked in advance, and can just sort of arrive from the north, kick back, and relax before my flight home.

I have looked up popular beaches and have started looking at various resorts, hotels, guest houses, etc. and there's (obviously) a lot of options.  So I thought I'd ask here in case somebody might have some ideas for me.

- I will be saving money along the way staying in hostels, so I don't mind splurging a bit on something nice on the beach for the last couple days/nights in the country.  But if I find a nice hostel with private rooms, I want to consider that as an option as well, as I enjoy mingling with other backpackers.

- I want to stay somewhere that's close to some ""night out on the town"" type establishments in the evening..  so bars, pubs, restaurants, etc.  It doesn't have to be right next door, but I want to be somewhere where I can walk 5-10 minutes and be in the middle of party central.  Having said that I don't want to be right in the middle of party central, so that I can actually rest at night.

- I am still not sure how many days/nights I will spend in Ho Chi Minh before my flight home..  For now I'm going with 1-2 days max..    However, I also had thoughts to maybe check out the Mekong delta, if I have time, and make a day trip out of that.  I suspect I will be a bit tired from all the travel near the end of my trip and might just want to relax on the beach and not really spend more than 1 day exploring Ho Chi Minh and taking it in, but am open to suggestions.

Usually I book things as I go, but you can find much better deals on swanky beach resorts, beach huts, etc. if you book in advance.  So I want to take a look and see if I can find something that meets my criteria, but wouldn't mind some tips as to where exactly I should be looking.

I will be travelling 1-2 months from now.

236,Best Way to get Reimbursed for Airline Maintenance Delays,1,a7y2mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/a7y2mq/best_way_to_get_reimbursed_for_airline/,13,1545342423.0,"
TL;DR best way to get compensation for delayed-for-maintenance flights on 3 separate airlines.

Long Story:

Not to say that someone else hasn’t had worse luck and worse flight delays, but my most recent trip was chalk full of delays on different airlines and while I’m totally fine now that I’m home, I’m still annoyed. I’m looking for advice on the best way to get reimbursement from each airline. Currently, I am planning on just going through each airline’s customer service phone line, but if there’s any other recommendations for what I should do, I’d love to hear them.

All of this flying is in the US

Flight 1: just me affected, delta airlines, got on flight, engine wouldn’t start, deplaned after an hour, flight delayed a total of 3ish hours, normal connecting flight would have been missed so they rebooked me to a different airport where I eventually made it to my destination 5 hours after us should have, 5 hours of work missed, somewhat important meeting missed.

Flight 2: my in-laws flight was delayed/cancelled(not sure) due to maintenance, American Airlines, AA rebooked them on a later flight causing them to miss a paint and sip class that I paid for, in-laws have no interest in paying me back but (if it’s easy enough) they’ll go through the reimbursement process for the paint class and give me the reimbursement, I know it’s only $60 but I’d rather not eat that

Flight 3: return trip home for me and wife, United Airlines, flight delayed due to maintenance (incoming flight landed but there was an issue so they lazily (yes I’m most upset about this flight) went and grabbed another plane from the hangar), flight was delayed about 1hr and 15min which essentially ate up all of our layover time at the next airport and we ran about a mile (not exaggerating) through the airport and made it to our connecting flight literally as the gate agent was walking away to shut the door, the whole plane waited just for us which was really nice but if we would have been 30 seconds later the doors would have been closed. Yes we made this connecting flight but I’m pissed about me and my wife having to run through the airport to barely make the flight

So 3 different airlines, 3 different situations, what’s my best options here? Thanks in advance for the suggestions.

Side note on Flight 1: Delta overbooked the flight by 2 people and offered 2 $800 dollar Amazon gift cards for people to take a later flight, guess who wasn’t smart enough to take that offer? Me and 100 other people :(","[""Flight #1: Read Delta's Terms and Conditions for delayed flights, [it's Rule #19 here.](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract-of-carriage-dom-2NOV18.pdf) They did everything they're legally responsible for.\n\nFlight #2: No airline will pay for a missed Paint & Sip class.\n\nFlight #3: No airline will pay for you having to run in an airport."", 'There’s no regulation in the US that you could lean on as a passenger; the best way is to bitch to the airlines on social media, email and phone and hope they’ll give you something.

I totally understand we were super lucky to actually have a replacement plane; I just didn't feel like they cared to do the plane switch expediently. And yes I know the saying wouldn't you rather have it done right than fast, but it was less of feeling them doing it right and more of a feeling of a lackadaisical operation.\n\nI'm sorry to hear of your delay earlier this year, that sounds like nightmare :( But same, I guess maybe next time we'll opt to miss the connecting flight rather than get stressed out running through an airport."", ""No, but if it makes you feel better to try to get something that you're not entitled to, go for it."", ""That's actually the Paint and Slip class."", ""What may have seemed to you like a slow process in getting a replacement aircraft was probably done as quickly as they could. \n\nIn our case, the delayed flight was PHL-MAN.

I realize that I can get a full refund from Delta and simply buy the United ticket, but I don't want to go through the trouble if United is just as likely to reschedule the flight, as well.","[""All of the major legacy carriers in the US operate about the same.  Delta is actually slightly better for on time stuff as a percentage, but it hardly matters, you don't care about averages, you care about your flight. Overall, the carrier you fly on is rarely important, no matter who you fly, things can happen, things can change, both in their control, and out of it."", ""From my experience in the past year and a half I've taken 4 flights on Delta and 4 on United. The 4 taken on delta all changed times, some by only a few minutes, some by hours, some flights changed multiple times and the plane being used changed as well. The 4 flights I took on United never changed any times at all and stayed exactly how I booked them.\n\nI'll add too all the flights booked on United were booked within a month of the flight so that could play a major role.\n\nIt is annoying when flight times change, but with ample notice isnt a big deal(for me anyway.)\n\nThis is purely anecdotal and YMMV."", 'Seems like they do it every damned time on me.  ', 'I suppose the answer to the central question is anectdotal, but still helpful:  Based on your experience, between the two airlines, is Delta more likely to reschedule the flight yet again, or would you put your money on United to reschedule?', 'There is no difference, all of the airlines operate about the exact same if we compare similar routes. This is one of the inevitabilities of the of how running a major airline works.']"
242,Just had a terrible traveling experience with Delta...Need help,0,4r3er8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4r3er8/just_had_a_terrible_traveling_experience_with/,8,1467603069.0,"My girlfriend and I were scheduled to take a two week trip to Europe that had us leaving the US on the 17th and returning home July 2nd. When we arrived at the airport on the 17th our original flight to ATL was delayed due to weather (totally normal, I know), however, after being delayed for two hours ( last hour was inside the plane) we were told by the captain that there would be an additional 30 minute delay for the flight being 800 pounds overweight. This now 2 and half hour delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in ATL that was going to take us to Stuttgart. We waited for over an hour an a half in the ATL to speak with Delta about our situation. We were told in the counter that the best that they could do for us was to put us on a flight to Paris that then connected to Stuttgart over 24 hours after our original scheduled arrival in Stuttgart. The representative offered us a discounted hotel voucher in the lovely COLLEGE PARK area of Atlanta (very sketch and unsafe). The following day we boarded our flight to Paris and then to Stuttgart which were both issue-free. However, when we finally arrived in Germany, our bags were still not with us and we were told that they would not be in Germany for at least another day. We didn't receive our bags until after midnight the following night, so 3 nights without any luggage. 

But it gets better.... Our returning flight to the states was to land in BOS first. Upon arrival to BOS we were informed that our connecting flight to RDU was cancelled for ""Crew Issues"" and that the best flight they could do was 24 hours later on the exact same flight. They also managed to leave my girlfriend's luggage in Europe. 

How should I approach being compensated for this disaster? So far the only helpful rep we spoke to gave us 5000 Sky Miles and a $100 voucher, which I feel is absolutely unsatisfactory. 

tl;dr: Delta sucks, went 4 days without luggage, multiple cancellations/missed flights that were Delta's fault, how should I go about getting compensated for this? ","[""For the outbound flight, not much. You got there and not relevant to EU261 claims.\n\nBut given your flight to BOS was fine, you can't claim EU261 since BOS-RDU is within US and also operated by US airline.\n\nAsk for more miles and a partial refund? It's a negotiation now pretty much, you're not really entitled to much, since there was no IDB or anything.\n"", 'I think what you got is as good as it gets.  Kind of the nature of the beast when traveling.  Shit happens and you move along :)', ""While frustrating. What you just described is fairly normal and happens from time to time.\n\nWhether it's Delta or United or Whoever, all the airlines are going to handle this situation the best they can. It's not that Delta sucks, it's that the airline industry is extremely complex and runs on very tight margins so it's not possible to just offer refunds every time a flight is delayed and shit like this happens.\n\nMy advice is to get over it as soon as possible. Fighting the airline over this will get you nowhere 95% of the time and all you'll get is more headache and maybe more miles.\n\nAbout your Atlanta hotel experience...name me one major airport in the US that's not in the sketchy part of town?"", ""Ditto the other comments thus far. Your situation isn't unique or crazy or horrible... it's pretty standard crap.\n\nIn the future plan better with how you pack your carry-on luggage so a few days without your main luggage isn't a big deal.\n\nWelcome to international travel."", ""What do you expect us to do? Pretty much all of that is normal travel issues. They offered you compensation. What do you consider satisfactory? \n\nAnd College Park isn't the greatest part of town, but it's only unsafe if you walk around late at night (which is not wise in any big city really). "", ""I have refused to fly Delta for the last 10 years because next to United, they have been the worst airline I've ever flown (I had enough of last-minute reroutes to ATL and adding another day of travel).\n\nI won't say it's futile to complain, but you may have gotten as much as you will out of them. Delta customer service is generally pretty lacking, so the best way to go about it is to send a well-written complaint [using Delta's contact page](http://delta.com/talktous). Detail the problems you've had with the Delta portions of your itinerary and the luggage issues, and what you'd expect in compensation. Obviously, you should be courteous and professional about it, and detail reasonable expectations. You might be able to swing more miles or a better voucher for a future flight, or perhaps a partial flight reimbursement, who knows.\n\nAs for the luggage bit - I've seen enough people (including relatives who were traveling with me) have their baggage delayed that these days, the only thing I bring with me is a carry-on. Saves hours in airports every time I travel since I don't have to stand in lines or wait for baggage, either. I know it's not an option for everyone, but traveling light is very liberating and a lot more convenient."", ""I would say BOS is not in a sketchy area at all especially relative to College Park, and it's tough to just get over it when it cost me over 2 grand and went without luggage for so long (spent unnecessary money on clothes, etc.) "", ""I'm not saying it doesn't suck. Of course it sucks. But it's part of traveling and you'll definitely lose if you keep fighting them so letting it go really is the best plan of action.""]"
