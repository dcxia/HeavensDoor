7,JetBlue: We Are Raising Fares And Fees!,1,9qwgx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/9qwgx9/jetblue_we_are_raising_fares_and_fees/,2,1540383129.0,"“We’re raising fares and fees because our fuel bill is sky high and travel demand is strong”

JetBlue Airways confirmed what anyone who has shopped for airlines tickets lately already knew: the airline, like its competitors, has been aggressively raising fares to offset sharply higher fuel costs. 

Airlines executives are often reluctant, at least publicly, to admit that tickets prices are on the rise, using industry jargon like “improving yields” to talk about the fare climate.

St. George said jet blue led “several” successful industry fare increases in the July- September quarter and also led the industry’s baggage fees higher.

In late August, JetBlue became the first major airlines to hike baggage fees. The new charges will be $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for second checked bag, up from $25 and $ 30. Alaska airline’s bag fees are due to increase in December. 

Airlines are able to pass along fuel costs because travel demand is strong from business travelers and vacations. On united airlines’ quarterly conference call last week, President Scott Kirby, called it “one of the best revenue environments we’ve ever seen.”","['It’s made a huge difference in profitability. Our airline profit went down 50% the first half of the year.  It’s caused us to raise bag feed and slow our expansion. ', 'No need to justify it with the fuel bill.

Secondly, the AC units just don't put out enough cold air to cool any airplane.  Once you're in the air, the pilots can control the AC system but the stewards are the ones that request certain temperatures.  In my opinion, they always keep it too hot.

They had a $29-base fare deal, and I just couldn\'t help myself.  Of course, I had to pay for a bunch of extras, but it was still WAY cheaper than any other option.  And, even accounting for some increased hotel/transportation costs to fly in to Islip, it was still cheaper. Frankly, the satisfaction of giving the hotels/transport the money, instead of the airlines, gave me great personal satisfaction.  \n\nThere was a slight hiccup on out return trip.  They made some change with caused us to lose the 2 seats ***we paid to*** reserve on the way home (probably a total of $10-15 total).  We had to pay to reserve 2 seats to ensure we could sit with our kids.  The bad--I had to spent WAY TOO MUCH TIME on the phone trying to resolve the issue, which our family was supposed be touring Central Park.  The good--the Frontier was sympathetic and competent, and gave us all an upgrade to the ***fancy*** seats at the front of the plane to correct the error.     \n\nMy experience with Frontier is that it is similar to Spirit (which I have only flown once, one-way, solo with 2 kids).  It\'s a similar experience.  Yes, you have to know the rules, you get nicked-and-dimed on extras, the gate area is ridiculously overcrowded, and it feels very ""Greyhound,"" but it gets you there.  Don\'t expect anything else.  The key is to have ***very low expectations***, then you are less likely to be disappointed.  \n\nMy biggest fear is having a serious problem with my flight, luggage, etc., and then facing awful customer service.  But, when we had the hiccup with Frontier.\n\nBONUS--Apparently, at ORD, Frontier has gates in the international terminal.  So, we went through international TSA (which was very different than domestic--much better actually), but there was also some confusion on how to collect luggage if you are not going through customs.  I\'d fly Frontier again, but only if it was much cheaper/more convenient that other options.', 'I\'ll disagree with the other posters. Frontier is a budget airline. They will get you from point A to point B safely and cheaply, just like Spirit or any of the other discount carriers. You will get exactly zero perks and you will pay for every extra, but you will get there safely.\n\nLike Spirit and unlike the majors (American, United, Delta), Frontier doesn\'t have much elasticity in their scheduling. This means that if they have to cancel a flight for whatever reason, you\'re going to be stuck there. At least with the majors, you stand a chance of flying standby on the next available flight. With Frontier, that\'s less likely.\n\nI\'d say Southwest is the best of the discount carriers at the moment. After them I\'d lump Spirit, Frontier, and most other discount carriers tied for second place. Dead last would be Allegiant, whose maintenance is best described as ""technically legal"".\n\nBut do yourself a favor.

15,AirCanada Travel Story,0,cu8hxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/cu8hxw/aircanada_travel_story/,1,1566561024.0,"Dear Diary – err Air Canada,
On Wednesday August 21, 2019, I left Regina for Toronto at 6:40am(ish), I arrived in Toronto about 3 hours later, I was filled with hope. 
The flight was supposed to be leave at 2:50, I would be back in Jersey for 4:20, and it would be easy to train the train from Newark airport, to my place in Waldwick, NJ. 
That flight got delayed until about 4:45, but alas, they still boarded the plane, telling us about 10 minutes later, hey guys, its going to be an hour due to a ground stop – okay, just an hour on this hot plane, nothing to---- “Excuse me passengers, they have cancelled this flight” ---- shhhiiii…
So rebooking occurs, initially wanting to throw me in for Friday at 6:40am, here I am knowing I need to get back to work by Friday, thinking that won’t do, so I manage to get squeezed in for Thursday at 6:50; not ideal, but hey, it could be worse.
Me thinking, well the flight was cancelled because of weather, but was delayed because of AirCanada own problems in Chicago trying to get the plane here, and then apparently having to find a different plane for us to take to Newark – but hey, AirCanada doesn’t take responsibility, sure that delay was our fault, and had we been on time we would have been the storm system, but we screwed up, got here late, and had to cancel because of it – but we will blame the weather, lest we comp a hotel room for a guy. So what can I do, it’s a late flight out, I can’t be at an airport all night, all day and all afternoon waiting for the evening flight – guess I will have to fork out money for a hotel. 
Then, all day Thursday, I am tracking the storms, thinking they gotta cancel, they gotta cancel, but 6:20 comes around, Air Canada boards us, and then we sit on the runaway for 30 minutes, I am thinking, here it comes, we are getting cancelled we are getting…and we are taking off? We get 20 minutes away from Newark, when I see we are doing circles in the sky – this is normal, Newark sometimes makes you hang out for another 30-45 minutes, they won’t make us – “Excuse me passengers, we are being told to hold for 3 hours, and we don’t have the fuel to do that, so we are going back to Toronto”
Shiiiiiiii
Land, sorry bro, can’t get you to Newark tomorrow, or Saturday; can get you to Laguardia though? 
Me…well if I take the bus from LaGuardia to the subway terminal in Jamaica, then the subway to Penn Station in Manhattan, then NJ Transit to Secaucus and finally NJ Transit from Secaucus to Waldwick, I can get home tomorrow? Guess we are going for “Attempt #3: LaGuardia Edition”
2 cancellations, what does AirCanada say? Sorry bro, weather.  
Here’s hoping when regulations go into play, some MP puts a clause in saying you can’t blame weather, if the original screw up that delayed a flight long enough for weather to be an issue, makes it still your fault. 
P.S. JetBlue is the best airline in North America, and if it ever goes to Canada, you and WestJet will have to be better. When they were delayed by WEATHER for 8 hours, what did they do? Come out, give us their selection of snacks, which is much better than the pretzels AirCanada stocks, and bottles of water, because that’s what a good company that cares about its customers does.","['Canada has new protections for passengers. Google to see what it covers. But weather often as a delay means ZERO. Certainly in America, there are ZERO protections and you would be doing the same thing you did honestly.']"

34,Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it...,3,7ac8ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7ac8ox/could_us_legacy_carriers_bring_back_domestic_3/,3,1509665206.0,"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen?

36,What Airline out of these would you recommend most?,3,3ait97,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/3ait97/what_airline_out_of_these_would_you_recommend_most/,15,1434846922.0,"I'm not sure if this was the correct subreddit to post this on, but anyway, I'm planning on taking a trip to Miami, Florida the end of next week. The only reasonable flights are flying Frontier to and between Frontier, US Airways, and American Airlines flying back. I've only ever flown JetBlue before, and have only ever had good experiences with them.

My question is, basically, how are your experiences onboard with those airlines? Like, with JetBlue, you get free snack and beverages, and are also able to watch tv. Although, those things are not important to me, but they definitely make the trip more comfortable.

My friend(who is a huge enthusiast of anything aircraft and also works at an airport) recommended Delta over American. So basically, which airline/s out of the ones I've mentioned would you most recommend? I know it probably doesn't matter, but I figured I ask for everyone's opinion on which they prefer.","['Keep in mind that JetBlue is one of the better domestic airlines on the US, and to the best of my knowledge no other airline has personal TVs across their whole fleet, and when you do get a personal TV you usually need to pay to watch most content. However, I know that Delta offers a netflix-like service through their app if you connect via wifi with enough free content to keep you occupied. For this reason, in addition to the fact that in my experience service on Delta tends to be better than the other airlines you mentioned, listen to your friend and fly with them. Also, flying on one Airline both to and from Miami may help keep costs down. Out of curiosity, where are you flying from? ', ""You also aren't looking at FLL as a substitute? Thats where all the low cost carriers operate. MIA is a very expensive airport which keeps low cost carriers out and fares artificially high. FLL is 20 mi away."", ""Every experience I've had with US Airways has been an absolute nightmare. I can't say about the others. "", 'AA has terrible service generally - but for a short hop like this, just go with the airline that matches your time/value preferences the most. If JetBlue has provided you good service, why not stay there?\n\nAlso, remember: saving 20 bucks on airfare may seem like a great idea when you\'re home in front of your computer, but then suddenly you\'re stuck in a horrible seat with 28"" legroom, faced with all sorts of fees, greeted by surly flight attendants (again, AA), landing in some low-cost airport having to go hours on a bus to get to where you *really* wanted to go. Usually it pays off to choose when you\'d actually want to go and to which airport - and then take it from there. Most of us aren\'t better off in real life by flying ultra lowcost airlines at odd hours or to airports in the middle of nowhere.\n\n*May not be relevant to you, but maybe for others ...*\n\nIf you see more air travel in your near future, hopping into a loyalty program may direct your preference? \n\nRemember that alliances matter when choosing loyalty program. Delta is part of Skyteam, the worst of the big 3 alliances - AA is part of OneWorld, the best one IMHO. United is part of Star Alliance, the less bad one. \n\nIf you don\'t fly a lot and/or fly for work internationally, alliances don\'t matter. Delta should be reasonably good with its Medallion program.', ""I've only flown American and I've never had any problems... I think they are a great airline and knowing that Miami is one of their hubs it shouldn't be that expensive"", ""How about substituting MIA for FLL and flying Virgin America direct ? They keep getting rated the USA's top airline for overall experience. Might make the journey more enjoyable?"", ""You are flying economy. It doesn't matter."", 'Thanks for the helpful info. I would be flying from LGA in New York. I would have definitely chosen Delta, just I will only be staying at the most 4 days, and the price for a round trip is a bit more than what I wanted to spend.', ""I have been thinking of FLL as a substitute. With the cost I'd be saving with the ticket, I think that's the better way to go, considering I won't be staying long. Thanks for your help."", 'Really? Last time anyone checked there is a HUGE difference between the JetBlue/Virgin America side, and the Spirit/ domestic legacy products. \n\nThere is a quite a range of options in quality and price on domestic carrier economy products ', ""Ok, in that case it's best just to choose the lowest price. Keep in mind that because they are merging, service on US Airways and American will be essentially the same. On a long flight to Miami (say, from Seattle or L.A.), you may want to pay a little extra for better snacks, personal TVs, etc, but on the 1.5-2 hour flight from NYC it does't matter all that much IMO. In case you weren't aware, JetBlue flies into Ft Lauderdale, which is just a short train/cab ride from Miami. "", 'bah. it\'s domestic economy. what you call huge (or ""HUGE"") is an inch or two difference. it\'s all crap.', ""I agree with you on that for longer trips. I usually don't bother with the TVs anyways, and 1.5-2 hours go by fast. I actually flew to FLL with JetBlue last year and remember Miami being a short drive when I had looked it up. I actually did not think of taking the train to Miami until you mentioned it. I think I'd be better off taking a train and then a cab to my hotel. It would definitely cut my costs down since I am only staying a few days. Thank you for your help!"", ""Also Uber now. It's very cheap between FLL and MIA""]"

This is the second time I've had the problem, the first time I called and made the reservation on the phone.  This time I'm just taking a different airline, and I replied with a ""Goodbye"" email.

It turns out that, despite their website saying they support Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, according to their email the site only works in Explorer.  Here is what they said:

> Please be sure that you are using Internet Explorer as your browser, when accessing www.jetblue.com.  Safari and Firefox work adequately but not as dependably as Internet Explorer. Please avoid using Google Chrome, as due to computer capabilities this can give you unexplained an untraceable errors.

Here is my reply - perhaps I was harsh, but I generally like flying Jet Blue, they are the only airline that flies out of the nearest airport to me, so it's disappointing.  I will add that neither Firefox nor Chrome worked.

>I thought this might be the problem.  I tried using your site with several different browsers and it was broken with all of them.

>First, even the US Government is recommending that people stop using Explorer due to flagrant repeated security issues.

>Second, I don't use Microsoft machines at all.  I don't have anything that will even run Explorer.  And neither does an increasing proportion of the flying public.

>Third, Explorer is slow, not standards compliant, and if you ask your web team they will tell you is so broken that 1/2 their time is spent making accommodations for the failure of Explorer to work like EVERY OTHER BROWSER.  That is, unless your web team is so amateurish that they are doing nothing BUT Explorer.  That is an approach that even a three-person startup company no longer uses.

>If Jet Blue insists on continuing to be Explorer centric, I will be forced to stop flying Jet Blue.  As far as I have found, you are the only airline that has this old, lame, stupid approach to the web. I'm sorry this is necessary - I like flying Jet Blue but if I can't make reservations I can't fly.

>I highly recommend that you pass this on to someone in management who can take steps to fix this amazing level of stupidity, carelessness, or ignorance in your IT department.

I pray no one fly United ever again!",0,2i4gv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/2i4gv4/dear_reddit_family_i_pray_no_one_fly_united_ever/,0,1412310244.0,"Why I will never be flying United Airline ever again, no longer referring and urging friends and family to never fly with them again as well. Now here’s why, May 31’st 2014 I booked myself a flight from SNA “John Wayne” to SEA “Seattle” for October 3rd 2014 along with this so called “insurance”. Why I booked this flight was due to an event I am attending and I thought it was a great deal “at the time”. A month had past and some information was given to me by my peers informing me I should switch the fight to October 2nd and be there a day early as I am needed this day. Well immediately I contact United and was informed of their terrible policy in changing flights with all their outrageous fee’s and fare changes. I was informed to contact the insurance company as they should be able to handle this for me. Well this insurance company had no connection with United and had failed to mention that it is only for the event of an illness or unexpected emergency “would be nice if they provided this in details (not just in the fine print) before purchasing”. So I contact United again “mind you this is still about 3 months or more ago” and asked what my options where. I was told I can call 24 hours before the flight and pay a flat fee of 75.00 dollars to switch fights under same day. I thought ok I can do this but to protect myself I continued to search other flights and found JetBlue had a non-stop from Long beach to Seattle for 100.00 bucks. How could I say no right? So I contacted United again to verify and was informed by a second person that yes that’s correct. 24 hour same day is a flat 75.00 dollars. So I clearly said ok I will just do that option. The months have now past and one week ago September 26th 2014 I contacted United again to verify that this really is happening and I could be changing my flight 24 hours in advanced to the exact same flight a day prior “well 26 hours to be exact” and was informed “YES it is 75.00 dollars and I would change it for you now if I could” I was told. I thought awesome this will be fine, I’m only going to spend 75.00 extra and get there a day early. 48 hours before my flight, I call United again to verify and low and behold I’m given the “no sir that is incorrect” “you cannot change your flight for 75.00 dollar’s, you must pay 200.00 change fee plus airfare at 151.00 for a total of 351.00…” Excuse me??? My months and weeks of calling to making sure THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN has HAPPENED. I was in shock so I ask to speak to a manager. Well Mr. Manager gets on the phone and we get to the break down. Well it all gets broken down to that YES you can get that flight for a fee of 75.00 dollars, phew. Well here we are October 2nd 2014. I Call this morning about 30 hours before my flight to verify and am told “YES you will be able to get on the flight for 75.00 dollars bur we can’t do it for you yet” I asked if it’s best for me to do it at the airport and the gentleman informed me that YES that would be best. (26 hours before my flight) I arrive at SNA and go straight to the counter and am greeted by a nice lady, I give her the whole spiel why I’m here and she looks at me confused. I am now told “no, no the 75.00 dollar change fee is only for same day. You will now have to pay a 150.00 dollar change fee and airfare…” WHAT??? Well ladies and gentlemen I am speechless. I would get nothing out of this women as she is typing away and not even looking at me. I request my papers back and call United AGAIN, and finally someone within the States answers. I give the WHOLE run down of what has happened and why I am now at the airport looking like an idiot. I am told by her that (with attitude mind you) “oh your fare doesn’t qualify for the 75.00 dollar change fee, I don’t know why you were being told this...” WAIT WHAT? What am I to do now? I need to get to Seattle like NOW! Here is what my answer was and the option I was given “pay the change fee’s OR WAIT FOR IT… I can pay a 75.00 change fee for a different flight the next day….” WOW I am in shock. Didn’t she just tell me my fare was not allowed for the changed fee but now it is on another flight? Well let’s just say United has done NOTHING for me other than get me to Seattle a few hours earlier by paying a 75.00 change fee… Guys and Gals, I urge you all too please rethink before EVER flight United. They are crooks, liar’s and thieves. No one knows what they are talking about and all they want to do is take your money and provide poor service.
