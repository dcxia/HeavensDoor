Seeing as churning and award travel go hand-in-hand, this is also a word of warning for savy churners looking to transition into the next phase that is award travel. It’s not safe to assume the same success. The process of award travel is much more difficult.

My one year of traveling has come to a close. I haven’t traveled nearly as much as those who do it full-time, but I have spent more than two million miles on flights since 2017. This post is a reflection of some of the frustrations of the miles and points game that are often forgotten and omitted in posts on reddit and in the blogosphere. I went from being an avid fanatic of the hobby with barely any reservations to a huge critic of the many overlooked obstacles of award travel, especially the golden goose that is premium cabins that many, but not all of us, chase. After all, it was the first and business class redemptions rather than mileage currencies itself that got me and most of the people I know interested.

TL:DR: While churning and amassing a huge amount of points is relatively simple and straightforward (give or take the current rules in place and possible future restrictions), maximizing award travel can be quite the opposite, sometimes extremely time consuming and difficult to navigate.

I was introduced to the hobby in 2014 when, out of curiosity, I started looking up first class reviews. I stumbled across the blog, One Mile at a Time, and was blown away on how someone not much older than me was consistently traveling on first class tickets without travel benefits and little out-of-pocket expense. I finally was able to get my first “true” churning card in 2015 and since then have opened up several accounts.

But being both a full-time student and employee, meant that I had almost no time to travel. And when I did have time off, it was at most a week, two if I was lucky. This meant long haul travel was often out of the picture due to time lost in transit which brings me to frustration point #1:

1. You need time to travel.

Now I know most of you already know this as it’s nothing new. However, many of my friends who started with me in this hobby in 2015 are still sitting on the same treasure chest of points with a few redemptions but nothing significant enough to make a sizeable dent in their balance. The biggest constraint for them and many others was finding leave, which tends to be the reason why most people don’t want to do round the world awards that otherwise are one of the best bargains for miles in the business. My solution this past year was to no longer stay a full-time student and employee, which being young and without a family was an easier choice to make than most. But say you are able to find the time to travel, then you soon come to realize the next frustration point.

2.	Finding availability isn’t as easy with miles as with cash.

And this point here, tends to be a real deal breaker, especially if your time off often correlates to holidays when everyone else is off such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s. Or if it’s off-peak, but on an airline that only releases one business seat to partners (ie: Korean Air). Or there’s availability, but only far enough in advance (ie: Qantas or Air New Zealand), but too early enough to guarantee you’ll be authorized leave. Or like Cathay or Lufthansa First, where it requires you to be flexible enough to plan a week or two before your trip. Sometimes the airline is just plain stingy and doesn’t like to release award seats (IE: American Airlines on domestic routes). Another catch is that airlines don’t apply the same supply and demand algorithms to award availability that they do to the usual cash seats. Only a handful of award seats are allocated and then are released and restricted at varying times as you get closer to departure. Maybe it’s an oversimplification, but it’s usually an all or nothing type of ordeal. It goes from saver awards, to unaffordable standard awards, to no availability. Sometimes even in the reverse order.  It’s usually not the gradual change in pricing that you typically see with cash tickets.  Don’t even get me started on trying to find premium availability for parties greater than two. Sometimes you even have to find availability using another airline’s website (British Airways search using American Airlines), or there’s phantom availability, availability not searchable online (Alaska for Cathay), married segment availability (Qatar), and the list goes on and on. But say, you find the availability but as you’re piecing everything together online, an error message pops up. You call the airline up, feed the flights, only to find out your trip is significantly more expensive than expected or that the routing isn’t valid. Here we have frustration point #3.

3.	Your routing isn’t always valid even if it’s logical.

Oh boy does this require TONS of time and research. Especially if you’re trying to go for the real niche redemptions that can save you a bunch of miles. You have so many airline programs accessible with transferable currencies, multiplied by the amount of partners for each airline, and then some. This of course assumes that the airlines actually publish these rules yet alone follows them. Take for example the ninth circle of award redemption hell that is SkyTeam, save for Korean Air. The two most popular members, being Air France/KLM and Delta. Neither publish award charts to add to their already poor search engines. So you get awards that price out contrary to logic (IE: JFK-CDG-ZRH might be cheaper than JFK-CDG). My personal pet peeve is the maximum permitted mileage restriction since many of my routings to Europe require back-tracking by necessity not by choice. American likes to segment cap awards which really punishes those in small airports or prevents routing through third regions with certain exceptions. This is where United really shines, even with the introduction of the Excursionist perk/restriction, MileagePlus is still the most generous among the big three in terms of routing rules. I spent almost every day this past year researching on this topic, and every time I think I come close to mastering a program, I find something new or a program change renders some of my past knowledge obsolete. Say you cross all your t’s and dot all your I’s on your upcoming Etihad first itinerary. You find the time to travel, find the availability, and verify the cost and route validity. You can call American only to find out that they can’t book it nor find the availability. Thus, frustration point #4 is often overlooked.

4.	Booking awards isn’t always straightforward

The example above is caused by US based American Airlines agents being unable to see Etihad first availability, whereas certain call centers like Australia and New Zealand are able to find and book your request. But sometimes it’s not even technical issues like that. YMMV even with the CS reps themselves, especially with one of the off the beaten track currencies like Turkish. One of the top posts on r/awardtravel outlines the process in booking a second first class JAL award seat and it’s a great example of frustration points #2 and #4. It’s great to see how some of the top posts in award travel help breakdown these processes in simple and easy to follow steps to make frustration point #4 much more straightforward. It doesn’t help that airlines love to tack on fees during the booking process: fees for booking close to departure, booking over the phone, booking on partners, etc. In the end, all these fees (sometimes avoidable, not always) make award travel not as free as it’s hyped up to be. I’m sure you can figure out our next frustration point, since people love to advertise award travel as free travel.

5.	Award travel isn’t free and neither are miles.

There are tons of clickbait titles and misleading propaganda on blogosphere and especially YouTube vlogs about how they scored a $XXXXX flight for $5 as the main point rather than the amount of miles used to book the flight. Miles are definitely not free and even if someone offered to cash out my entire point balance at a generous 2 cents per point, I’d still feel short changed. There’s so many rules in regards to taxes and fees yet sometimes the only way you find out is at the final step of the booking process. Taxes and fees vary depending on the currencies used and the airlines redeemed and navigating these can be a huge headache. So while I can redeem 230K United Airlines miles for a roundtrip between HND-FRA in ANA first class for “only” $120, most people would agree that 93K AMEX points with a 30% transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic with $375 in surcharges is a much better redemption. So no, one doesn’t redeem first class ANA for just “$120”. Props if you’ve read this far, as we’ve finally reached the final frustration point.

6.	Information on award travel is not as readily blogged as churning information or trip reports.

I think it’s a shame that there’s more focus on how to accrue points than on how to spend them. At first, this confused me, especially when the latter is much more difficult. What’s the point of churning if you can’t reap the rewards effectively? The cold truth is that blogs and referrals receive commissions on the amount of credit card sign ups, not the amount of award redemptions. In fact, many blogs also profit by offering award booking services so having everyone informed, would be a loss of another revenue stream. I only started browsing flyertalk once I needed information for award redemptions since information on churning is readily available, at times over saturated. For example, there are tons of posts advertising IHG credit cards and how Intercontinental Thalasso is a great redemption of IHG points! $1,000 vs 70K IHG points, 1+ cpp! But there are almost no posts anywhere regarding how to successfully book award nights, even on flyertalk where it becomes obvious it’s a closely guarded secret. There’s a huge discrepancy of information between r/churning and r/awardtravel, and while I think doctorofcredit is the best resource for churning, there’s clearly not as much information on the website for award travel.

In the end, award travel may not be as much of a glorified hobby compared to churning due to its difficulty, but it’s definitely just as important. In fact, I still hesitate pitching churning to certain people who can easily accrue points and succeed in the hobby, but don’t know anything about award travel. There’s little use in collecting a huge sum of points yet unable to redeem them, only for them to be devalued year after year.

I know it might seem like I'm just a cynic and anti-award travel, but I certainly still support this hobby just hopefully with a little more research and awareness from current and upcoming churners.

EDIT 1: Changed point 6 from information not as readily available, not information not as readily blogged.","['Complexity is our friend.  If it was easy then everyone would do it, and there would be no opportunities for outsized value.  Look at SWA for example.  Easy, but since points are a straight cash value, no sweet spots.  Of course availability on some programs is horrible, so then don’t accumulate those points.  \n\nHaving options with multiple currencies, looking at awardhacker.com, and investigating taxes/fees for each program, and researching the special hidden gems of each program (like ANA RTW, United excursionist perk, Alaska partners F with stopovers on one ways, etc) can get you where you want while still optimizing value.\n\nThe other point I will say is hotel points are quite easy.  Sure you might not always get the cpp you want, but there is almost always availability.   If the process is getting frustrating, and you don’t care about premium cabin travel, then booking flights through Chase/Amex/Citi portal and using points for hotel stays is a viable strategy.', ""For me, it's a hobby. And like most hobbies, it costs a great deal of time and money. I actually enjoy mastering all the tricks of the trade. People that don't have the time or inclination should churn bank accounts and cash out points. "", 'Agree. Though if it were easy it would be too popular and the whole thing would disappear. \n\nMost frustrating thing to me is flying international with the front half of the plane empty. Airlines that prefer to leave premium cabins empty rather than release awards, sell at a discount, or upgrade elites. So wasteful.', ""I feel like a lot of these frustrations stem from the emphasis on all the blogs about CPP. Yes, there's obviously a floor for redemption values, but I personally would never book a business or first class flight in cash, so these 5/10/100 CPP valuations are somewhat meaningless to me. As long as I'm able to fly for free and get to where I want to go, I'm happy. And if a redemption is out of control, and I need to pay cash, that's fine with me too."", 'I want this hobby to be accessible.  I don\'t want it to be easy. I am perfectly willing (in fact, I quite enjoy) the hours I\'ve spent trolling through airline website schedules looking for that one set of matching dates that perfectly fit my desired trip destination, with flight times that ideally fit my schedule.  I\'m trading cash out of pocket for time spent, and even then, I\'m still getting well over $100 an hour in ""value"" for that time.  \n\nI\'ve tried to entice co-workers and family into this hobby.  Interest is usually peaked when I describe what I\'m getting out of it, but it fades quickly once I start explaining the process.  Sure, I could travel around the world in first class for a fraction of what even an economy ticket would cost... but it would mean I\'d have to take out TWO new credit cards this year.... and that... gosh.. just seems like a lot of trouble.\n\nActually, the issues people seem to have revolve around various misconceptions about the way things work.   It seems like a scam to some people.  You\'re getting something for nothing.  It\'s envelope stuffing, pyramid schemes, and vector/cutco all rolled into one, and they\'re too smart to fall for such a clearly deceptive scheme (again).    Even if they buy into the fact that it works and people are doing it, certainly there\'s a catch.  The timeshare salesman will turn up eventually, or their credit will get ruined, or they\'ll be forced to pay for it later.  To some degree, they\'re right.  There IS a catch.  The catch is they\'ll be financially undisciplined enough to be profitable to the credit card companies in a way that is not ultimately beneficial to the cardholder.  Some people simply don\'t have the credit rating to support this hobby.  And even if they do, they don\'t have the mental capacity to handle walking around with 6+ figures worth of credit in their wallet and not suffer an endless urge to USE it.  It requires strategic cancellation of annual fee cards at the appropriate time to take advantage of the terms of service to not only retain the awards they\'ve earned, but to take advantage of it again as soon as possible.  \n\nI\'m happy to help people figure this out.  I\'m not withholding secrets or trying to maintain an unfair advantage.  But it\'s a complicated maze to navigate at times, and a lot of people simply aren\'t cut out for it.  At the end of the day, they buy Q class economy airline tickets and stay at the Motel 6 and prefer to remain oblivious to what they\'re missing out on.  So be it.

Nothing lined up and we had the option of traveling over a 3 month window. \n\nNowadays well still get points when new cards come out but I've directed 90% of spending towards chase points and use their rewards portal for 1.5 cents a point.

Of course award travel is difficult if you are expecting outsized redemption values. \n\nLook at cash back credit cards - most are at 1.5% with a few at 2% which equates to 1.5 or 2 cents per point.

But you look at it, and it seems so simple.  Just two little jumps.  I had(still have) every award currency covering every major card/carrier, but that doesn't matter when an award on Sri Lankan airlines or Air India incurs fees that are like $10 less than a cash fare.  Or Air New Zealand domestic.  All I found was 13000 etihad miles...or like $80 usd.  What's the point.  Try to book through chase/citi portal, and prices are 2x+ what they are on any other website.  And I literally had no schedule, no obligations, I could go anywhere anytime I wanted, except I couldn't if I only used awards.  And then you hit the point where you look at your enormous pile of miles that isn't being touched, and it's like, I can book a 1 hour airasia flight for $70 cash to get to where I want, or I could fly to another continent in biz for less than that plus these points that currently feel like they have no value.

You HAVE to call them and you HAVE to tell them to use a different computer system to look up the flights, otherwise they will just tell you that nothing is available. In addition to the flight, there is a $100/ticket surcharge. I used our Hilton Aspire credit to buy $200 gift cards and then redeemed 20k Delta miles & the gift cards to buy the ticket form NBO-SEZ.

1,28-year old guy who hasn't traveled much - where do I go?,18,a4iw62,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/a4iw62/28year_old_guy_who_hasnt_traveled_much_where_do_i/,92,1544366618.0,"Okay guys/gals - this is kind of an awkward post and not sure if this is the right sub for it, but here goes.

I'm a 28-year old guy living in Texas currently (grew up here) and have also lived in Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, and Florida during college. I've visited LA/SF/NYC/Chicago/Denver, etc. Outside of the country, I've been to Dubai and India.

But most of that was before I turned 22. I have not much done traveling at all personally (LA/Chicago/SFO/NYC trips were all mostly for work).

My mom has been telling me to travel for over 2 years, and I'm finally taking her advice now. I've been earning 6-figures since I was 24 and also in a intense job/role, so never did much traveling even though I had the money for it. In fact, my mom got mad at me in early 2017 tell me that I make enough to go enjoy myself a little more lol.

In the past 3 years, I've only left the state of Texas once for a non-work trip. And my job stress has driven me crazy to an extent where I NEED to start traveling now to get a break and maintain my sanity lol. So this July, I visited a friend in Denver for a few days.

I want to follow my mom's advice of traveling/taking a vacation for at least 3-4 days every quarter of the year. My job, while stressful, offers me a lot of flexility (I have almost 100% control of my schedule - they don't keep track of my PTO or anything.). So I'm trying to have more of a life now and get out there haha.

From hitting minimum spending requirements on various cards (since September of this year), I've got:

* 100,000 AA miles
* 185,000 SPG/Marriot points
* 120,000 Chase UR points
* 117,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points
* 285,000 Hilton Honors points

I have to reinvest a lot of what I earn back into my job (I'm an investment manager in a startup type role), so I'd prefer to spend as little out of pocket to travel as I can haha, hence why I racked up all these points since September. I'm fortunate enough that my job allows me to fly first class and stay at nice hotels (one reason how I hit the minimum spend on all those cards so fast lol), but I'm perfectly fine with flying economy/staying at cheaper hotels for personal trips.

Places/things I'd like to see and do (currently on my mind):

* Japan/South Korea/Taiwan
* Vietnam/Malaysia/Indonesia
* Spain/Italy/UK/Germany/Switzerland (kind of cliche from an American but w/e lol)
* Denmark/Sweden/Norway
* Israel
* learn skiing (Colorado or Michigan)

My only question is, is there some guide for somewhat low cost places to visit for a beginner traveler? I want to start off with low-cost trips to get myself used to traveling more often.

Edit: I should add that I love all kinds of food (I’m definitely a carnivore though!!) and not really picky at all about what I see. I also don’t mind staying at lower tier hotels abroad, if it means I can make my points last for more trips. I’ve honestly gotten my fill of 5-star hotels through work here in the US (the Plaza, Peninsula, Four Seasons, etc.).

I’d like to fly business or first class at least once (preferably using points) and am fine with economy elsewhere granted the airline is of decent quality. The trips I’ve had to Dubai and India with a friend and with my family were all on Emirates. I definitely don’t want to fly Spirit/Frontier or the European or Asian equivalents of those, if I can avoid it.

My mom has told me about hostels, but I’d rather have my own room (or share a room if I’m traveling with a friend) than just be thrown into a big room with a bunch of strangers and risk getting my stuff stolen (lol) - at least this is my impression of hostels, so please correct me if I’m totally off base.","[""Not looking into the points you have, I would recommend going to Europe if you've never been there.

If you want to know what you are eating all the time, then just keep in mind that different cultures have different viewpoints on things like ""what part of animals are edible"", and language-barriers can further confuse things.

I travel for work incessantly although boring this is allowed me to become very efficient at travel. \n\nfirstly don't take three or four days off... take off one week. this is only five work days compared to four but when you include the two weekends it will turn into 9 days total. Even if all you use these extra four days for is some version of a staycation around your house it will turn a 3 or 4 day getaway in to 9 day getaway.\n\nvisit friends! Sharing the experience with someone else is going to make travel phenomenally more enjoyable. you have been on business trips these feel artificial. You don't have anyone to share the $40 steak with, or the beautiful sunset with. start by traveling to visit college friends, family members, old girlfriends, great uncle's, and whomever else you can share the experience with. Even if it's not the most amazing destination fishing in Wisconsin with your great uncle beats a $1000 hotel in Rome! Picture who you really want to be remembered as by these friends and then go fill in those blanks that you feel were lacking.\n\nFly non-stops outbound Friday evening and inbound Saturday afternoon. With your week-long vacation, starting first thing Saturday morning and having Sunday to recover and get you back into the next work week has always been my plan. this may cost you a few dollars or a few points in airlines but it'll be well rewarded in any inconveniences involved in the travel. airlines don't lose your bags on non-stop flights, they lose them in transfers. If you have all day Sunday to relax or catch a flight home if weather delays occur, your vacation does not become another headache. This day dedicated to travel is not wasted vacation time when you have nine days to enjoy, but it crushes of three day weekend getaway.\n\nnow taking a travel buddy fishing with your great-uncle maybe a little weird. But once you're looking forward to sitting on a beach in the Caribbean a travel buddy makes the experience shared and valuable. Be this you drinking buddy from school or significant other traveling alone continues to suck even in the most fabulous natural wonders.  as you tour your group of old Friends make it known that you wish to travel further afield and invite you're compatible friends to be your travel buddy. the reason not to have your travel buddy as your significant other is three years from now you don't want all of your pictures from the great barrier reef to show some girl who smashed your heart and screwed your best friend. The reason to bring a so is... Great vacation sex."", ""I would give a high recommendation for checking into Thailand, you can stay at very nice 4 star boutique hotels (Oriental Residence) right in Bangkok for about $100. Im sure you could make your miles go along way with hotels there if you wanted to spend even less of your own cash. Street food is very tasty and cheap, most nice hotels can set you up with a local guide and driver for taking you to all the sites for an absurdly cheap rate. The people are very friendly and English is prevalant in most of the main areas so you won't get to overwhelmed with the language barrier there.\n\nAnother tip, I would add the Chase IHG CC to your quiver of cards. It has an annual free night at any of their properties world wide (new terms aren't quite all but close) and with a $49 annual fee is a no-brainer. I stayed with points at both locations in Berlin and was very impressed, I'm fine with a clean basic room so Holiday Inn's across the globe have never let me down and provide good value. In Berlin you could book a car with UR points and road trip around Germany with a little planning. I drove down to the Nurburing on the Autobahn and had the time of my life, plan ahead and you can hit up some of the car factories across the country if thats a thing you like.\n\nLastly if your intimidated with scheduling or want to meet some interesting new friends and don't mind spending some of your own cash look into Contiki trips. They are for 18-35 year olds and can be really fun if you like to party and see a lot of places in a short time. I think they are a good value and a good place for a beginner traveler to see a lot and catch the travel bug. "", 'Seeing this post reminds me why I need to move to America.

Do you have any sort of specific passions or interests?\n\nFor example, as I began to travel more and more and did the European cities thing when I first started out, I discovered that I was WAY more interested in traveling to see nature and wildlife and the countryside. The cities were cool, don't get me wrong, but I discovered a personal preference. So, I started taking road trips and going to pretty off the beaten path type areas instead of major cities. I went to Costa Rica twice,  but went to the more remote areas in the southern part of the country which had some seriously incredible places and unbelievable biodiversity where I spent some time deep in the jungle.\n\nI also did a roadtrip through Scandinavia last winter. Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Denmark. The goal was the see the Northern Lights, and took us above the Arctic Circle and to the Russian border. \n\nI've also lived in Israel, which is amazing and has a ton of inexpensive places to go and stay.\n\nAre you traveling totally solo? Have a group of buddies? Down for road tripping or would prefer something with public transport? Like nature or more interested in museums? General comfort level with non-English speaking countries?\n\nOnce you can hone in one what you're truly looking for, I think your search will be more fruitful. Personally, if I was just starting out and didn't really have a preference, I think I'd go the Euro route to get your feet wet. That way, once you really know what you're looking for, you can do some of the more exotic locales with a bit more direction to really get to what you're looking for.

Loads of history and great food, only downside is the cost. \n* Denmark/Sweden/Norway - Never been but I'd put these below the other European countries above. \n* Israel - This doesn't particularly draw me in, but would be really neat to see all of the historical sites. \n* learn skiing (Colorado or Michigan) - Skiing could be a great get away, a couple hour flight and you'll be a quick drive away from some from some great ski slopes.

Read the ""Anti Churning Rules"" guide on the sidebar for more details.\n\n> What are the churn rules for a card like the Ink Business Preferred?\n\nYou can get a second one if you get an EIN.  If you don\'t have a real business though, then it\'s usually good to space out Chase biz cards a bit more though.', 'I went with my fiancee, but it\'s fine to go there by yourself too, I\'ve done it many years ago, and if you get lonely Tinder works somewhat (there were ""pros"" on there too, just be careful). Everything from hotel to food to transportation is super affordable even if you are just by yourself and doesn\'t have anyone to split the hotel costs. (Like $50 a night for a nice clean hotel)\n\nWe went to Chiang Mai and Bangkok, those are the prime spots if you aren\'t into all the island/beach stuff. As for the stuff I ate, way too much, but here\'s some highlights:\n\n**Thip Samai** - This is supposedly the best padthai in bangkok. I went there back in 2015 and it was alright. This time though, they seemed to have increased the amount of sugar in the pad thai which I really liked. They also have a stall in the food court of Siam Paragon so you don\'t have to go out of your way to the main branch and wait in the long line. Their pricey orange juice is also pretty amazing, freshly squeezed using their local oranges that taste totally different from Tropicana. \n\n**Laem Chareon** - This was a bougie Chinese/Thai seafood restaurant chain ($50 ish for two) that had a really tasty fried baramundi and black pepper mantis shrimp. Would splurge again. Not a good place for solo travelers though as the dishes are meant to be shared\n\n**Terminal 21 Food court** - Most of the stuff here are good, for example, the Rad Na at stall number 8, the mango sticky rice (probably the best sticky rice I\'ve had in bangkok) at stall 24, som tam at stall 1, pad thai at stall 5, stewed pork leg rice at stall 9, guay jab at stall 13 (get the offal-less version if you can\'t handle offals). Did I mention everything was around 30-40 baht? **That\'s like $1 USD.** \n\nMalls in Bangkok were pretty amazing, Siam Paragon, Terminal 21, EmQuartier, and the newly opened IconSiam for example. The new IconSiam mall was pretty breath taking even though the top floors weren\'t finished yet. They somehow managed to integrate authentic local food vendors into the lower floors when they could have turned it into some bougie food hall. I ended up eating green curry and fried little shrimps (50 baht each) from a local vendor in the Thongburi Delights area. The vendors on the fake boats were legit as well. Comfort and AC of a mall combined with local foods, now that\'s what I\'m talking about. \n\nAs for temples, the big ones to hit are Grand Palace, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun in Bangkok, then Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Phra Singh, and Wat Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai. The Doi Suthep one is interesting to get to because you board the local red trucks called songtaews at the 7-11 near the north gate along with 7 other people, then you embark on this twist and turn two lane road up the mountain for like 30 minutes. \n', 'It\'s not bad, due to the presence of buddhist monks and hardcore followers who turned vegetarian, there are a decent amount of ""jay"" or vegetarian food available. For example, in the food court of Terminal 21 in bangkok, there\'s a stall dedicated to jay food. At most local places, the veggie dishes can be made without fish sauce, which makes it eligible to be called vegetarian (but you gotta learn some basic thai phrases for that). And restaurants catered towards tourists usually have a good vegetarian menu. ', 'Here’s what I don’t get. The 5/24 rule is if you’ve gotten 5 credit cards across any issuer in the last 2 years, Chase won’t approve any new cards for you.\n\nHere are all the cards I’ve gotten approved for in the past 12 months (forget 24...):\n\n- Costco VISA\n- Chase Slate\n- Discover IT\n- Synchrony Bank (card for my furniture retailer that allows me to pay off my tempurpedic at 0% interest in over 4 years) \n- AMEX Business Gold\n- AMEX SPG Personal\n- AMEX Hilton Business\n- Citi American Airlines Business\n- Chase Ink Business Preferred\n- Chase Marriott Business\n- Chase Ink Business Cash\n- Chase Ink Business Unlimited\n- AMEX Platinum Personal\n- AMEX Platinum Ameriprise\n\nSo I’ve definitely blown by 5/24 and yet I got approved for 3 Chase business cards (all of which adhere to 5/24 in order to get approval - https://thepointsguy.com/guide/ultimate-guide-chase-5-24-rule/)...what gives?\n\nAlso, I can’t seem to find what the rules are on churning a Chase signup bonus.

What is it for Chase?', ""5/24 only counts cards on your personal report.  Most business cards don't show on your personal report (including Amex, Citi, Chase, the ones you have).

2,Which airline to build elite status with?,27,9e6f2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9e6f2s/which_airline_to_build_elite_status_with/,75,1536460798.0,"I travel a lot for vacation and my s.o. is a flight attendant so I take a lot of random long haul flights out of the country.  I'm thinking that it's time to build elite status with an airline, but I don't know which one.  

Any recommendations?  

I've flown Delta and United before and I've been more impressed with Delta, but I'm located in NJ which means I mostly fly out of Newark (a United hub) and I don't really like how AmEx is declined everywhere.  American seems to have the best credit card at the moment with 2x points on dining and gas.","[""If you're flying out of EWR, then United is a no-brainer.\n\nIf it's PHL, then same deal with American.\n\nThe real goal here is not the award miles, you won't build up enough from flying where one program is much better than another. The real goal is the status perks, like lounge access, upgrades and especially priority treatment during delays.\n\nAlso worth considering that US airlines often don't grant lounge access to high-level fliers in their own program, but do give it to passengers with mid-level status in other airlines. For example, as a United Platinum, flying coach, I don't get United Club access, but as an Air Canada Gold flying coach, I do.\n\nPoint is, depending what's important to you, you may do well to get status with a different airline that's partnered with the one you fly all the time.\n\nLast, if you're flying on any form of discounted tickets provided by your S.O.s employment, I wouldn't be surprised if those tickets don't qualify for airline status."", 'Two data points:  1)  Delta miles do not expire, and 2) American award flight availability has been a disappointment from my perspective.', 'Just do delta,  if you get AMX Platinum you get in all delta sky clubs, plus you get a Priority Pass Club membership that gets you in to many clubs world wide.  ', ""Some benefits to compare (note, I'm from MSP so I fly Delta a LOT):\n\n- Delta has Rollover MQMs, meaning if you get 45,000 MQM in a year and meet either of the spending requirements, you get Silver and roll over 20,000 MQM to the next year. Makes re-qualifying a lot easier.\n- Delta and United offer spending requirement waivers. American lets you earn Elite Qualifying Dollars based on credit card spend, but that doesn't waive the spending requirement outright.\n- Delta Platinum and Diamond give you Choice Benefits, which means you get to pick extra perks that make sense to you.\n- American elites have an upgrade coupon sort of system - unless you're Executive Platinum (top tier) you have to choose which flights you want an upgrade on. Delta/United just upgrade you if your ticket is eligible.\n- With American and United, you have to pay for club membership. With Delta, if you're Diamond you can get it with Choice Benefits for free. Otherwise, airline club membership comes as a perk of certain credit cards.\n\nIf you're not elite and wind up flying Basic Economy, United does not let you bring a carry-on bag. American and Delta do."", 'If you’re flying out of EWR you’re taking United most of the time.\n\nIf you want lounge access Aegean airlines or one of the more generous star alliance members is probably best.\n\nIf you want a better chance at seat upgrades United’s program is probably best. But if you aren’t going to a smaller airport, the chances of upgrades without Platinum 1K are pretty low.', 'You’re likely to have more options on United flying out of EWR so I’d go with that', 'I like to stick with Airlines that I don’t actively suspect hate me for existing, so I go with delta. ', ""I would go with whoever your Significant Other works for!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a United Elite, and have been one for a long time.  The best benifet might be being in the Star Alliance.  The amount of flights in Europe / Asia/ USA and Africa are spectacular. Network is a little weak in south america but is getting better.  I think we have a75k sign up bonus now.  Also if you get to Gold in United you get Gold status with Marriot, which is an ok status to have, and has recently been devalued, but it is something"", ""I'm a Delta lover and Virgin Atlantic always has award space for whatever flights I've needed. Virgin Atlantic is also one of the few partners with both Chase Sapphire and Amex Plat if you are looking at those cards. If you prefer one carrier over another and EWR isn't a hub for that carrier, you can always list pay cash and hop a short flight to your hub of choice.\nFor instance, I live in Texas and United is big in Houston and American in Dallas. So I usually get a cheap flight to ATL to catch my reward flight on Delta metal."", 'It depends on where you want to go, and where you\'re based. Also, just because an airline\'s miles are easy to collect does not mean they will be easy to redeem. This has become universally true among the Big Three in recent years.\n\nThe key variable to consider here are alliances and partner airlines. Those are usually a better redemption opportunity for spending your banked miles, but they vary considerably. For example, if you\'re a United person going to Europe, you\'ll probably end up redeeming miles for Lufthansa or Air Canada (they\'re cheaper and easier to find than United deals). To Asia, you\'ll be on ANA or Singapore Airlines. Or United, if you don\'t mind cramped seats on old planes. United\'s overseas partners are usually fantastic. American\'s can be good, unless you\'re going to Europe and get stuck flying British Airways (their ""fuel surcharges"" are hundreds of dollars per flight). Delta\'s overseas partners are utter shit. Don\'t bother. \n\nThere\'s also the issue of award availability when you need it. Just because you have miles doesn\'t mean they\'ll have the seats you want on the flights you want. AA and OneWorld usually have good redemptions, but you usually get routed through five airports along the way and stuck with British Airways and their fees. United\'s most luxe partners for Europe flights (the Lufthansa Group) keep their best seats hidden until two weeks before departure, so you can\'t really plan a trip in advance with those airlines. Availability has been sharply decreasing across the board lately, so there\'s no clear winner on this metric.\n\nFinally, you\'ll want to think about the seats themselves. Look online at the different airlines\' products for seating, food, customer service, etc. United still flies a lot of planes with 8-across business class seating, and half of BA\'s business class seats face backwards. Some airlines are known for great flight attendants (Delta) or great food (Austrian/Swiss/Japan Airlines), and some are known as flying Greyhounds (LOT Polish, United, the Icelandic carriers). Pick one that you can tolerate, because few things ruin a trip like a painful seat and food that makes you vomit just to smell and look at.\n\nI would recommend something different from everyone else on here: Don\'t get an airline card. Instead, get a card with Amex, Chase, or Citi. Each of them allows you to accumulate points in that card\'s point system, which you can then transfer at a 1:1 ratio to a vast array of individual airlines. You can transfer Amex points to Hawaiian or Virgin Atlantic, or Chase points to British Airways, and so on. Bank points this way, then find available award flights on an airline you can tolerate, then (quickly) transfer points to that airline\'s FF program, book your seats, and go with it.', ""I go Delta. \n\n1. Points don't expire. \n2. Once you are platinum any time you fly international you get lounge access (even on points). \n3. Never had a bad flight experience in 300K miles\n4.

There is no other way to get Air Canada Elite status that I know of.\n\nYou can get the spend requirement even if you fly mostly on United, but the trick is that only AC tickets (014-) count towards spend - so you'd have to buy some United flights on aircanada.com as an AC ticket in order to count towards Elite 50k.  Unless you buy a lot of revenue flights, I would say it would be hard to earn AC E50k flying United based out of EWR.

3,Airline Award Booking Basics,332,aox4xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/aox4xe/airline_award_booking_basics/,64,1549777563.0,"#Airline Award Booking Basics
Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say “Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what?”

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program’s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program’s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline’s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won’t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don’t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE’s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR’s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let’s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don’t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are “Savers” awards, and “Anytime” awards.  

“Savers” are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline’s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

“Anytime” are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I’m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay’s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it’s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It’s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United’s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let’s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don’t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won’t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don’t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can’t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don’t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven’t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let’s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline’s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like “Use Miles”.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let’s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn’t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline’s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people’s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for “Mixed Class”, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can’t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let’s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it’s own, but I’ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people’s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don’t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline’s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip…

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can’t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You’ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don’t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you’ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state “On Request”.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to “Ticketed”.  In the past, I’ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline’s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline’s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don’t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn’t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don’t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

There are tons of topics we did not cover in this Basics guide.  How to transfer Points, how to actually search for rewards, how to determine which FF to use, etc.  Let me know what topics you would like to see me cover in the future.

5,Trip Report - JAL 777-300ER First Class - SFO-HND,18,47d599,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/47d599/trip_report_jal_777300er_first_class_sfohnd/,56,1456356871.0,"I figured since /u/LumpyLump76 was kind enough to share his experience in J on the JL 777 that I would offer up my trip report on that same aircraft in F. You can also find the full report with pictures [here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/review-jal-777-300er-first-class-sfo-hnd/). If you don't feel like reading the whole report I'll give you the cliff notes - It's awesome and you should do it if you can!

After a brief stay in the mediocre JAL Sakura Lounge (avoid this lounge if you can), we decided to head for the gate a bit early. I am a through and through airplane geek so if the lounge does not have a view of the tarmac, I would usually rather sit at the gate area. 

For this flight we opted to redeem American Airlines miles which cost us 62,500 miles + $5.60 in taxes and fees per person. We got lucky and found 2 F seats available on the route ~6 months out and then I simply built the itinerary around this flight. I earned the miles through the sign-up bonus on my Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select card (messaged Citi and was matched from the 50k offer to the 60k offer). This really offers some truly exceptional value when you consider most one-way first class tickets to Tokyo go for ~$10,000 per ticket!

As we were already through security, it was a short walk to the gate from the Sakura Lounge. Since JAL’s flight to Haneda departs so late, the terminal was pretty empty. As we rounded the corner to the upper level of our gate, I saw the magnificent 777-300ER being prepped.

[JL 1 Waiting At The Gate](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1739-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

**Japan Airlines 1**

**San Francisco (SFO) – Tokyo-Haneda (HND)**

**Depart: 12:45 AM**

**Arrive: 5:05 AM**

**Duration: 12 hours, 20 minutes**

**Aircraft: Boeing 777-300ER**

**Seat: 2D (First Class)**

SFO’s international terminal is set up with two floors. One above the gate with seating, and one on the boarding door level with seating as well. We grabbed some seats on the second floor as it had better views and fewer people. Once boarding was announced, we made our way down the escalators to the boarding door level where multiple JAL agents were waiting with signs inviting First Class passengers to board. While walking the gauntlet of agents I had no less than 5 agents offer to wheel my bag down the jet bridge for me – now that’s service! It also kind of made me feel like a celebrity in a weird sort of way since so many people were doting on me.

Once down the jet bridge we turned left at the first bridge for the business class and first class cabins. We boarded through door 2L and made a left passing through the mini-business class cabin before seeing our home for the next 12+ hours.

[Home For The Next 12 Hours](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1744.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The First Class cabin is configured with 8 seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. If you are traveling with someone else and wish to speak with them during the flight, I would recommend you take the two middle seats. While you can talk across the aisle, it is a bit difficult/awkward.

[JL 777 F Cabin Configuration](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/JL-6.png?w=398)

If you are seated in the middle seat and do not know the other person in the seat next to you, there is a nice little motorized divider that you can put up for total privacy (which you can see in a picture further in).

Although the First Class suites are not fully enclosed, they do feel exceptionally private. Not as private as seats 1A and 2A on Cathay Pacific, but still very private none-the-less.

Waiting at the seat was a pillow, an amenity kit, a blanket, a pair of slippers and a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones.

Also waiting at the seat was the menu for the flight which was contained in a rich brown colored leather folder with the JAL First Class ‘F’ emblazoned on the front. It was quite striking.

[JL F Menu & Headphones](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1745-e1455375648107.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Upon putting my bag in the overhead, our flight attendants came by to introduce themselves, welcome us aboard and offer us a pre-departure beverage with a warm towel. I selected a glass of orange juice and was a bit disappointed it was clearly from concentrate juice. You can see the divider I mentioned above in the picture too.

While sipping my orange juice, I perused the menu for the flight. Since the flight departs so late, there would be no dinner service, but only a caviar course and light snack. The menu read as follows:

[JL F Menu 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1751.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I am not entirely sure how clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl qualifies as a “Western Breakfast”, but who am I to judge?

After checking out the meal choices, I perused the drinks selection. If you are in to champagne (it is really not my thing), JAL serves Salon in their First Class cabin. I was more excited about the Hibiki 17 year old they had though – and it did not disappoint!

[JL F Drinks Menu 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1755.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After reviewing the menu, I started checking out the seat controls and the screen. The seat controls are conveniently located on the arm rest next to your seat and even feature a massage function.

[JL F Seat Controls](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1748.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The JAL First Class seats feature a 23″ LCD screen which was perfect for the seat. Not so large that it hurts your eyes, but also not so small that you have to strain to see whatever you are watching. The table underneath the screen slides forward to you for your meal service, desk, etc.

[JL F IFE Screen](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1746.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The LCD screen is controlled via a controller in the armrest console area. It was a bit difficult to use at first, but once I got the hang of it, it offered a lot of features – including in-seat ordering!

We had a quick departure and before I knew it we were airborne. I always love watching the airshow, so I of course had that on while the snack course began.

[JL F Airshow](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1763.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Although I am not the biggest fan of champagne, I also had never had caviar before, so decided to order both to see if the combination may somehow sway my tastes.

[JL F Caviar & Champagne](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

As I said earlier, JAL serves Salon champagne in their First Class cabin, which is better than most other champagnes I have had before, but still not my thing. As much as I love to travel in extreme luxury, I am more of a cold beer and street food kind of guy in most every other aspect of my life. And I have to say, I just really do not have the palate for caviar and champagne.

[Caviar & Champagne + Airshow](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1769.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After I finished the caviar, I ordered the sushi. It was excellent. I do not just mean for airplane food either. I mean it was excellent, restaurant quality, sushi and exactly what I had a taste for.

[JL F Sushi](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1770.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Shortly after finishing the snack, I was presented with a pair of JAL pajamas and asked if I would like to change and have my bed made. The pajamas JAL offers are as soft and comfortable as can be (ignore the wrinkles as I took the pictures after I arrived home from the trip). As an aviation nerd, I also love that they include the JAL logo on the shirt. Be aware though, the sizes seemed to run one size bigger than you would normally wear (i.e., I normally wear a large, but a medium fit me better).

[JL F Pajamas 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/JL-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After coming back from changing, I noticed that the flight attendants had set up a little bar with champagne, waters and some light snacks. I grabbed a bottle of water and headed back to my seat.

[Mini Bar](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1780.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

JAL offers both soft and firm mattress pads. While I normally like a firm mattress, I opted for the soft mattress pad. I forgot to snap a picture of the bed made up, but man was it comfortable! I settled in and started to browse the entertainment selection and eventually settled on the movie The Intern with Robert DeNiro. It was decent, but it did put me right to sleep.

I tend to not sleep very well on airplanes and true to form, after a few hours of sleep, I was wide awake. The cabin temperature seemed to fluctuate from stifling hot to freezing cold during the flight, so it is something to be aware of.

[Airshow](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1772.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Since I was up, I fired up my laptop to do some work and ordered a cup of coffee which was brought out in a French press with a little hourglass to tell me when it was ready to drink.

[JL F Coffee 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1784.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Not only was the coffee excellent, but the JAL coffee mugs with the First Class logo on them are probably the coolest I have ever seen. I mentioned this to both of the flight attendants working the cabin (I was the only one awake in the cabin so the service was incredible) and they seemed to take great pride in the product they were putting out.

[JL F Coffee Mug 3](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1785.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After my coffee I decided to order some fresh fruit and champagne (I'm really trying to figure out why people love this stuff so much?). I do not know why, but it just sounded good to me. And it really hit the spot!

[Champagne & Fruit](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1774.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I thought it was a nice touch that they offered toothbrushes with mini tubes of toothpaste in the lavatory so I took the opportunity to brush my teeth. At that point I was wide awake and knew I would not be sleeping anymore so I had my bed put away.

[JL F Lavatory](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1778.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After working for a few hours, the flight attendants came around to take orders for breakfast. I opted for the Japanese style breakfast and it was delicious. The smoothie that came with it was excellent as well. The only thing that missed the mark for me was the miso soup – though I think that was more a cultural thing than anything else.

[JL F Japanese Breakfast](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1790.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

My girlfriend opted for the fresh fruit with a poached egg and a smoothie, and she said it was delicious as well.

[JL F Breakfast](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1792.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After breakfast, I had a slight sweet tooth and decided to order another cup of coffee with some ice cream. They only had vanilla, which I figured would be bland, but still ordered it. It came out beautifully presented with a waffle wafer.

[JL F Ice Cream](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1803.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

For vanilla ice cream, it was probably the best I have ever had. It was so good that my girlfriend ordered one for herself after tasting it.

After my ice cream we were about an hour outside of Tokyo, so I went and changed out of my pajamas. When I got back to my seat, one of the flight attendants handed me a JAL bag.

[Mystery JL Bag](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/JL-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I was unsure what it was and asked. She said that because I had mentioned that I loved the JAL coffee mugs, that the purser had wanted me to have a set for myself! I thanked her profusely for them and let both her and the purser know that I would be throwing out all of my coffee mugs once I got home as these are the only two I will ever need again. I mean seriously, how awesome are these mugs!?

[JL F Coffee Mug (again)](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1801.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

We had a smooth landing at Tokyo-Haneda, thanked the fantastic crew for their great job and then it was off to immigration before catching a bus to the Tokyo Hilton.

Overall, I was very impressed with both the hard and the soft product. The seat was comfortable, the service was beyond exceptional and the food was excellent. I think my only complaint about the flight was that it was not longer!","[""I took the route twice in F, would not recommend the sushi. While it's edible, it's far below what you'll get in Japan. If you had sushi in Japan before, skip it on the airplane"", ""Did you try the Chivas 21yr? Bottles cost upwards of $300 each I believe. I'm a big scotch fan, and when I went to Japan I visited the Yamazaki Distillery and tried the Hibiki 17 yr on JAL first class. Not a fan of Japanese Whisky, too harsh. In comparison, the Chivas tasted like candy. "", ""Wow, great trip report! I also saw Lumpy's trip report in J, but what are the main differences between F and J? Is it work the extra 12.5k miles?"", 'Just took a RT FC JAL flight from JFK to NRT and like you, I totally loved the mugs. I did not mention this to the FA, and now I am kicking myself, as I thought of any airline they would be the ones to give you some to keep! Nice TR. ', ""Oh man I'm now gonna spend the next several hours daydreaming about my ORD-NRT flight in F this November"", 'Great report- I just took this RT flight last week! It was a great time. However, I was so tired on the way home leaving at midnight after a day of sightseeing that I really did not soak in the FC service and slept most of the way. It was only about 8.5 hours as well which went by way too fast! Overall a great experience before the devaluation!', ""Great report, and congrats on the mugs!  Too bad they didn't give you a bottle of champagne, since you seem to like it so much. :)"", 'Awesome :)  Taking this flight in april and am very excited for it! Good tip btw about the coffee mugs, i actually was going to ask them for them anyways haha', "">Although I am not the biggest fan of champagne, I also had never had caviar before, so decided to order both to see if the combination may somehow sway my tastes.\n\nI'm exactly the same way. Even though I don't like champagne, I ordered the Krug and caviar combo on my last flight to HKG. Did not care for either one."", 'This is a dumb question, but did they let you keep the headphones?', 'Can anyone describe the major key differences between JAL 1st class and ANA first class on this segment (NRT-SFO)? or can one expect a similar experience?', ""When did you search for your flight? I looked on British Airway's site and it only showed availability in Economy for the beginning of January 2017"", ""Hmm, that's interesting because I found the sushi to be only slightly below what we got in Japan (which was incredible). I'm guessing you flew JL F both ex-US and ex-TYO?"", ""Couldn't agree more. I've been eating sushi most of my life and was really quite shocked that they would serve grocery store quality sushi on a first class flight. I only had it on the ex-SFO portion and the rice was very hard and the fish seemed like it had been refrigerated for quite some time."", ""I did. I had both the Chivas and the Hibiki and both were excellent. The porcelain bottle the Chivas came in was quite striking. I did prefer the Chivas to the Hibiki as the Chivas had no burn while the Hibiki had some burn on the finish. The FA originally brought out a glass filled to the brim with ice along with the bottle for me. I don't know how anyone can murder such good scotches/whiskies with ice? I was the youngest person in the cabin by 30 years easily though so I guess I just looked like that schmuck American tourist.\n\nOddly enough I thought the 18 year old Yamazaki they had in the CX Lounge at HND beat all 3 of them (for my unrefined tastes anyways). I actually liked the harsher taste and medium body of it."", ""Yes, IMO. Especially if you're traveling with a companion.  \n\nBigger bed, better food, better service, better alcohol. Not to mention the more refined and exclusive air you'll be breathing. "", 'I have flown both JL J and F, and I can honestly say for the extra 12.5k miles it is worth it. The whole experience is just slightly better in F than in J (though both are exceptional and among my favorite products). You will get a bigger seat, slightly better food and better booze, plus other small things like more attention from the FAs and pajamas.', ""Thanks! I wish I would have taken this flight from JFK for a few extra hours in the cabin, but there was no space and Winter Storm Jonas had shut down JFK anyways when we were leaving so it would not have mattered. Guess you'll just have to book another JL F trip to try round two ::grin::"", 'I certainly know that feeling!', ""The mugs are awesome and sadly probably the coolest thing I own, haha. I am actually not much of a champagne person. I read a lot of trip reports where people focus on what type of champagne the airlines offer and I thought maybe I was really missing out on something so I kept trying them. Bottom line, I just don't find champagne to be appealing or tasty - even after trying some of the best on offer."", 'You will love the flight. Everything is top notch and everyone really goes out of their way to make you feel like a VIP. \n\nI made comments to each of the FAs working the cabin about how much I loved the mugs and then even asked towards the end if I could purchase them anywhere. They said no and then presented them to me a short time later. It is a very cool memento of the trip and the only souvenir (other than a bespoke suit from Hong Kong) that I brought home with me.', 'I tried the Krug and caviar on my HKG-ORD CX flight and the Salon and caviar on this JL flight and I did not care for either either time. But when you get the rare chance to experience that level of luxury, why not? ', 'I wish! But no, you have to leave the headphones.', 'While I have never flown NH in F before, based on the trip reports I have read of the cabin, the NH F seat is going to be more private due to higher and wider walls than they are on JL. That can lead to the seat feeling a bit claustrophobic in my opinion (and based on my prior experiences with other more private seats). The actual seat and IFE should be equivalent. Both will offer pajamas and an amenity kit. Both will offer caviar. Food and booze should be about on par between the two. Beds on both should be comparable as should the crews as far as attentiveness and service. Overall I would say you could expect a similar experience.', ""As I recall, I booked this around August or September for a late January flight. If you're looking anywhere around the first of the year, award space can be tough to come by."", 'Hmm, I may have not tasted the Yamazaki 18yr old yet, but the fact they brought it out on ice doesn\'t surprise me if it was with your Hibiki. \n\nWhen we did the tasting at Yamazaki\'s distillery, it was the 12yr old and it was already combined with ginger-ale(called a ""highball""). I was like, how am I really tasting this if it\'s mixed? I guess Japanese whisky shouldn\'t be enjoyed neat as commonly as scotch is and that\'s why it\'s more likely to be diluted by some means. Explains the acceptability of the harshness. ', ""The Yamazaki 18 is great. It used to go for around $150 a bottle but I'm not sure what happened and now it's like $350-500 when you can find it."", ""Can you elaborate on the better air? Not sure if serious. :)  I booked J on a 787 from DFW over F on a 777 from SFO/ORD. Couldn't find availability in F in October from SFO/ORD, but even if I did, it was debatable as the 777's low humidity dries out my sinuses. The ultimate JL experience would be F on a 787, amiright?"", 'Man, hopefully I can get my next 60k miles to post soon so I can book before the devaluation... one person churning for two is a pain!', ""Definitely... AA is being rude and not opening up the short flight from BOS, although I'll probably book it anyway and slum it in the back for the 40 minutes.

Don't get me wrong, whiskey-ginger is my go to drink when I'm drinking liquor, but I mix Seagrams or something similarly cheap - not a 10+ year old whiskey.

The storm cancelled both segments so I rebooked MCO-MIA on the 763 with lie flats, MIA-LAX on the 773 in F and then LAX-SFO on a RJ. MCO-MIA flight got cancelled due to a maintenance issue on the plane so I misconnected on the entire itinerary. Ended up having to book MCO-DFW-SFO on a boring 757, but at least we made the flight to Tokyo. Total madness at the airport and I was very grateful to have the Platinum Desk phone number thanks to my AA status as there was no wait time to get an agent."", ""Absolutely love it and I will be going back for more. I spent days scouring the internet and talking to people about the best tailors to go to for a relative suit novice like myself. I ended up selecting Lee Baron and could not have been happier with the fit and quality. Lee Baron is in the Far East Mansion across from the Sheraton Hong Kong (where I happened to be staying by chance) on Kowloon Island. It's right by the East Tsim Tsui metro stop if you are staying elsewhere. I will warn you though that they see tourists coming and will show you the crappier fabric right off the bat. I had done a ton of research and knew exactly what I wanted and once I called them on the cheap fabric he took me to the Italian Loro Piana fabrics, which I ultimately selected. They're more of a traditional cut house, so if you're looking for an Italian style slim fit suit, they're not really the ones to go to. If you want a class English style suit with a few custom touches (what I opted for), then I would highly recommend them. \n\nI paid ~$750 out the door for a fully bespoke suit with a super 130 fabric. Add ~$200 if you want the suit fully lined (I don't think you need it unless you really want a fully structured suit). You can get cheaper fabrics and the suits will run you ~$400-550 based on what I was seeing. Also, since they have your measurements, they can send you fabric samples and you can select what you want them to make and they'll have it ready for you to try on when you arrive. "", ""Good call. The scotch certainly didn't disappoint!"", 'I contemplated doing this on my last F flight, but when offered the Salon 2002, I said ""Sure!""

After the tour you can go to their ""library"" where there is a circular bar in the middle you can order tastings at.

Made very sure of that!', 'But did she eat the meals at least? Maybe one or two drinks even?', ""Haha, you gotta tell them that they can't have it all!"", 'Quite the write-up :) Thanks. What was the turnaround? ', ""Man, I'm sorry I missed the distillery now. I did not even think to go look for one while we were there. Was there any cost for the tour or the whiskey tastings?"", ""She ate the meals (after I woke her up so she wouldn't miss them) and had a few glasses of champagne, but otherwise was asleep for most of the flight.

Also their 12-year old sherry cask won best scotch in 2014(I think?) beating out all of Scotland, Ireland, and the United States for the first time ever. That was a limited release unfortunately. They only made 100 bottles of it and they sold it only to foreign markets."", ""Hahah, but I say she did it pretty well.

I can never get good rest in a plane =/"", ""That is my exact game plan going in as well. I'm going to eat their food and abuse their good booze, then hopefully pass out.

1. Spend 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai (100k UR points + 2 free nights from Hyatt card)

2. Fly to Maui and spend 4 nights at the Marriott Wailea Beach Resort (160k points). I don't have enough points for this, so not sure what the backup plan is. 

3. Flights. This is where I get confused. I was planning on booking Korean air, but since we're not married yet I found out we can't do that.

7,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Chase URs,66,49tbx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbx6/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_chase_urs/,52,1457643822.0,"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/), I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:


***Chase URs***

Chase offers only one personal card that allows for the transfer of Ultimate Rewards points to airline partners – the Sapphire Preferred card. Chase is pretty strict with their approvals for this card, so if you have picked up more than 5 credit cards in the past 24 months, chances are good you will be denied if you apply for this card, so plan accordingly/carefully.

Your URs will transfer to 6 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your URs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Korean Air**

Korean Air is a SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can redeem your SkyPass miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Korean Air is largely considered to be one of the best bang for your buck redemptions to Europe in general and is the best option among UR transfer partners.

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 50k miles for coach, 80k miles for business class and 100k miles for first class – which is the best option for premium cabin redemptions to Europe. Korean Air does allow for one-way award tickets, but as u/wiivile pointed out, the cost is the same for a one-way award as it is for a roundtrip. You are also allowed one stopover on a one-way award ticket and two stopovers on a roundtrip award ticket, which is truly incredible considering you are already getting one of the best redemption rates to Europe to begin with.

While Korean Air Skypass miles offer one of the best values, it can be difficult to work with Korean Air. If you are planning to use your miles to book an award ticket for another person, that other person has to be a family member (mother, father, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, wife, husband or child). You will also need to call in to Korean Air to book your award and the process is somewhat arduous. I would recommend that you call in to make sure space is available and then place a hold on your award ticket(s) before transferring your URs to your Skypass account.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your URs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**United**

United is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. As with Singapore Airlines, that means you are going to have a ton of options!

United uses a two-tier award system for their awards. Economy tickets are the same cost regardless of whether you are on a United flight or a partner flight. A roundtrip saver coach award ticket will cost you 60k miles.

Business and first class award tickets on the other hand will differ in price depending on whether you are flying on a United operated flight or a partner operated flight. For United operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 115k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 160k miles. Alternatively, for partner operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 140k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 220k miles.

As you can see, the much better value when redeeming for premium cabins is with United operated flights – though the actual product is going to be far less enticing than what some of United’s partners such as Swiss Air offer. Since Singapore Airlines would have access to much of the same award inventory as United, you are better off transferring your URs to them instead and then booking the exact same flights for 5-60k miles less.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the worst UR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Southwest**

Unfortunately Southwest does not currently fly to Europe, nor do they have any partners that fly to Europe. If you have a Chase co-branded Southwest credit card, there is a way around this to use your RapidRewards points for international travel, but the value is usually exceedingly poor and I will not get into how to do so here as it will rarely work out in your favor.

**Conclusion**

9,How long would you wait on Southwest Hawaii service?,7,alsc4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/alsc4o/how_long_would_you_wait_on_southwest_hawaii/,46,1548987073.0,"Curious to hear from others on this potential dilemma:

I have a trip planned to Hawaii in July. Hotels are booked and include the Wailea Beach Marriott booked on a pre-merger points rate, so the dates are firm. Still need to get airfare, which brings me here.

I have 65k Rapid Rewards points, approximately $700 in Southwest gift cards and vouchers, and a Companion Pass. Obviously, I'd prefer to fly WN, but the government shutdown has helped to delay the process of that service taking off. It sounds like service is close, but there's still the uncertainty of a potential second shutdown as well as the possibility that WN service to Kauai, where our trip begins, isn't part of the initial rollout.

We're five months from the trip, so flights aren't urgent at this point, but my personality is such that I prefer to have things locked up sooner rather than later. So how long do I wait on Southwest? My alternative, as we are based on the East Coast, would be to fly WN and position ourselves on the West Coast, and then fly to Kauai on tickets booked through the Chase portal - I've seen as low as $329 on American from LAX - or potentially AA/Avios miles if that made sense. I've never been to Hawaii, let alone flown there from California, so I don't have a great sense on whether that's a good or bad price, or about the norm.

Related: Should I just go ahead and lock up inexpensive inter-island flights on Hawaiian, given that it's also unclear when that part of Southwest's service will begin, regardless of shutdowns and FAA approvals? I'm less concerned about the flight back, as we'll likely ignore WN and take a red-eye on another airline.

Thanks for any thoughts/advice.","[""300-400 RT is a good deal for economy from the west coast. it's unclear how much room that has to fall further when WN enters the market. \n\nI agree with not risking it for inter-island (if you can actually find inexpensive inter-island right now). "", ""Even if they started selling tickets tomorrow, Southwest won't be selling you a single ticket to Hawaii from anywhere except the west coast. I can go into the reasons if you're interested. So you'd be stuck with paying for two tickets, and overnighting once, probably twice, negating any value from the companion pass. \n\nThere is almost zero chance that Southwest will be flying interisland by this summer.

It’s highly likely they won’t even SELL you a single ticket to Hawaii, as they never sell flights with overnight connections. You can’t get to the west coast early enough to catch the flights to Hawaii. And you get back to CA way too late to catch a connecting flight. The ideal Hawaii flight for us Californians is early morning to Hawaii, then an afternoon flight back. That means a flight will leave ~7-9AM, and return around ~8-10PM. This is how their competition is flying almost every single flight from SMF/OAK/SJC/SAN. I don’t see them starting new service with the worst times. If you want to use your companion pass from a town without a shorthaul, early, non-stop to those CA cities, you’ll have to buy two tickets. Maybe they’ll overhaul their system and finally allow these types of tickets to be sold? Unlikely. Don’t believe me?

If you're wondering why some of the totals are high, keep in mind that it's churning for 2 with my wife and I.  

Just to answer some questions ahead of time:

**Why did I pick the DoubleTree in Cairns VS the Sheraton Grand Mirage in Port Douglass?**

I have about 160k SPG points, and I wanted to save around 90k to transfer to Marriott for a 7 day nights and flights package to pick up some extra miles down the line (likely SW).  Since I spent about 50k in Sydney, I didn't want to spend any more in Cairns/Port Douglass.  I also didn't have enough Hyatt points to book the Regency in Sydney.  I have about 200k in UR that I think I want to save for another time.

**Why did you book J for the short routes across Australia?**

I was having a hard time finding Y fares around the holidays while traveling domestically around Australia.  So there were some points where I just said ""F it"" and booked J.  I'm glad that I was able to do this with my AA miles.  Between my wife and I, we had about 800k of those socked away.

This was a huge learning experience and I really couldn't have done it without you guys.  Let me know if you have any questions!

13,[Huge issue] AA doesn't consider pre-clearance while accounting for Minimum Connecting Time,0,9oljo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9oljo5/huge_issue_aa_doesnt_consider_preclearance_while/,41,1539705895.0,"**PLEASE READ FULL POST BEFORE DOWNVOTING/COMMENTING.**

So, here's the issue:

I'll arrive at JFK via an AA-partnered international flight and will have to take a domestic AA flight to CLT, all on the same ticket.

But my incoming flight at JFK would've had pre-clearance, so no customs clearance or immigration check-in would be required. My baggage will be transferred to AA due to an inter-line agreement between AA & its partner.

AA is not allowing me to book another flight that's after 65 minutes of my arrival into JFK, as its systems determine the MCT (Minimum Connecting Time) for an international flight to domestic flight connection at JFK to be 120 minutes. However, flights that've had pre-clearance should be treated as domestic! So, AA should use its domestic MCT value while calculating feasibility of an itinerary, if an international flight has had pre-clearance!

Because of this issue, AA has put me on a domestic flight that's late 38% of the time, with 58 minutes as the average delay. I've another flight after this one, which is 44 minutes later. But if the chronically-delayed flight would be delayed, I'd miss the next segment & the next AA flight to the destination would be after 11 hours, and of course, AA won't pay for a hotel, if it screws me over!

I've spoken to AA agents, a supervisor & her manager, but they told me they can't override it as it's 'illegal' and that the FAA would fine them 25k per incident. AFAIK, the 'illegality' is internal AA lingo for in-feasibility, and not related to any law.

How can I override the MCT set by AA? Has anyone had success in doing so?

For Delta, MCT for connections involving international flights that've had pre-clearance, to domestic flights, is 30 minutes.

**TLDR** \- For connections from international flights with pre-clearance to domestic flights, Minimum Connecting Time should be considered to be that of domestic flights, because the flights of the former type are treated as domestic flights (customs-clearance & immigration check-in is completed at pre-clearance sites). American Airlines uses the MCT for international flights to domestic flights, while Delta is saner in this regard (and maybe its ticketing staff is saner too. Delta staff has never asked me to go fly with the competition).","['You cannot override MCT.\n\nYou can attempt to have an agent change your flight day of, helps if you have status. \n\nJFK is an airport that does not have a lot of evening/late flights that can make getting to cities without a direct flight difficult.  \n\n', 'What do you want us on this sub to do?

14,Award Tickets 101: How To Find The Best Redemption,130,4aymw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4aymw5/award_tickets_101_how_to_find_the_best_redemption/,40,1458341776.0,"One of the questions that seems to come up a lot lately on this sub is “how do I find the best redemption to X destination on my points/miles?” Since we have been getting the question almost daily, I decided to put together a 101 type of post on one of the processes for finding the best/least expensive redemption. You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your URs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your TYPs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

Airline | Alliance | Total Mileage Balance
:--------:|:--------:|:---------: 
Delta | SkyTeam | 109,000 Miles
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 110,000 Miles
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 65,000 Miles
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
American Airlines	 | OneWorld | 54,000 Miles
British Airways | OneWorld | 109,000 Miles
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 44,000 Miles
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 110,000 Miles
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qantas | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 175,000 Miles
United Airlines | Star Alliance | 99,000 Miles
EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for “yyy Award Chart” (with ‘yyy’ being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you’re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control – regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA’s award chart – not LAN’s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the process that I use for determining the best redemption value for my points and miles, so hopefully it helps shed some light on how to find the best redemption value for your trip.","['Made a google spreadsheet for tracking total points possible using these transfer rates above and adding in hotel transfers from Hyatt hilton marriott and SPG:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hkL6xERtIe4GXmY21f5t518FByPl-L6d9qrlSmSAnI4/edit?usp=sharing', ""Thank you for the immense amount of work that went into this.

The significance of the alliance column is that alliance members can almost always book award flights amongst themselves.

For example, if you booked Lufthansa flights with United miles, you'd pay according to the United award chart. Each airline has their own award chart so just because you can book the same flights using United miles that you could book using ANA miles, doesn't mean that the award price is the same. \n\nThere's definitely a lot to learn in the redemption world and I'd recommend you read up as much as possible.

15,Award Flights to New Zealand Booking Experience,137,bpb0ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bpb0ra/award_flights_to_new_zealand_booking_experience/,42,1558032525.0,"I currently live in New Zealand and have booked 15-20 USA-New Zealand J awards in the past 18 months using many programs. With the addition of AA and United flying nonstop, it has become less of a unicorn than it was. It does involve a little more planning. Here is a lot of the information that I have learned about the specific route and my general booking process.  I have included many booking options but ran out of steam to include them all. It may also ramble since it was mainly written to pass time without internet coverage in the car.

  
**Nonstop**  
**Air New Zealand (NZ)**  
This space is hard to come by in J. A little easier in Y. The best way to look for space is an Expert Flyer alert since availability tends to be random if it opens up at all. More likely, one seat to open up, but I have seen multiple. More offseason space released. YVR, SFO, LAX, IAH, ORD, HNL.   
**United (UA)**  
Nonstop year round SFO-AKL, during \~April-October it does not fly every day. They do open up J space randomly on this route. I have seen 8+ J seats available, but this is an exception, not the rule. Do not expect saver availability around Christmas. I have seen J space released to partners. SFO.   
**American (AA)**  
Nonstop LAX-AKL daily seasonal, roughly November-March. They do release space on this route, but the release is not predictable. Some are close in, and some are further out. I have seen a lot of married segment logic on this route. PHX is a good city to use if you are looking for a default city that shows most married segment logic. LAX.   
**Air Canada**  
Nonstop YVR-AKL, 4X week, mid-December- end March. This route is brand new (hasn’t been flown yet), but they have released some J space. I anticipate there will be some changes for the 2020/21 “season” after they see how the route does. YVR. 

  
**Connections**  
Three main regions are used for connections to New Zealand: Australia, South Pacific, and Asia. Not all programs allow you to connect through all the regions. Almost all allow you to connect through Australia. If you are connecting through Australia on NZ a320/a321s they are a one cabin aircraft and do not have J (772, 773, and 787 do have J).

  
**Booking Through Award Programs**  
**AA**  
Their routing rules allow you to connect through the South Pacific and Australia to New Zealand, but not through Asia. AA is a pain to search since they often show a domestic F flight and a TPAC economy flight as a J award.  
Direct: Flying the seasonal AA LAX-SFO route  
Australia: Flying AA or Qantas to Australia and then Qantas to AKL, WLG, CHC, or ZQN. Qantas opens up flights \~360 days, which can reduce availability for AA at 330 days.   
Air Tahiti New: Decent availability has been showing in J without overnight connections when the schedule opens. Shows on AA’s website and flies to AKL.  
Fiji: Not the best product and availability is hit or miss. Remember to search for flights to AKL, WLG, and CHC since sometimes availability isn’t available on the final leg to each destination.  
Qatar: This counts as two awards and is in the process of getting Qsuites. Availability has been pretty decent for AKL-DOH in late 2018/early 2019.    
**ANA(NH)**  
This is the program that it is the easiest to find availability to New Zealand since they allow you to create your a routing with three connections. You have to fly TPAC, must book roundtrip, and are allowed one stopover. ANA’s search engine is pretty limited when searching, but you can use a multi-destination search to “force” your routing. ANA’s search engine typically does not include flights that connect from the US to ICN, TPE, PEK, or PVG on their searches. Remember to search for AKL, WLG, CHC, and ZQN. It can be time intensive to find an award, but I have never not been able to piece together a J award. Singapore opens up a decent amount of space on their AKL-SIN and WLG-SIN (regional product).   
**Alaska (AS)**  
Alaska has a different award chart for each of their partners. You can mix Alaska flights with a partner, but you cannot use multiple partners on one ticket. You are allowed a stopover on a one-way award. This gives you more flexibility since your TPAC and flight to NZ can have availability on separate days.   
Cathay Pacific: Must be booked via phone, use BA or QF to find availability, but keep in mind CX often releases one less seat to AS than One World partners. AKL, CHC  
Fiji: Can be searched on AS. Availability is sometimes different than Expert Flyer. AKL, WLG, CHC  
Qantas: Can be searched on AS. AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN  
Korean: Must book roundtrip. Searchable on AS. AKL  
**Avianca/Lifemiles**  
I have seen a lot of restrictions on what routes you can book with Lifemiles to New Zealand. They tend to be more restrictive than UA and ANA, but I still have found availability with them. You generally cannot create your routing. They do allow Asia connections.   
**Cathay**  
You can get additional award availability if you book directly. AKL and CHC.   
**Delta**  
Delta does not fly to New Zealand, and the rates are typically extremely high. They are partners with Virgin Australia, and you can connect through Australia. China Eastern (PVG), China Southern (CAN), Korean (ICN), and China Airlines (TPE-BNE-AKL) are Sky Team members that fly to AKL.   
**JAL**  
The cheapest way to book Emirates from AKL. Leaving AKL the YQ (fuel surcharge) is pretty low. The other One World information applies, watch for YQ. The rates tend to be reasonable, but the miles are tough to get. You can book 360 days out and will have access to One World inventory 360 days out.  
**Qantas**  
The advantage of booking directly with Qantas is that you can book \~360 days out and they sometimes release availability at the start of the schedule for their US routes. There is YQ, and the mileage amounts are typically higher than booking via AA.  
**Singapore**  
Partner award rates are very high, and UA in most cases would be a better option. If you want to fly SQ TPAC in a premium cabin, you almost always need to book directly through SQ since they basically never release those seats to partners. Starting in 2018 it does seem that there are releasing a lot more J space to partners from SIN-AKL/WLG/Australia  
**United**  
UA lets you route through Asia to get to New Zealand. The routes that they allow are highly variable and hard to figure out. I recommend searching for many US cities and AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN. UA’s issues booking various Asian carriers award space has reduced space connecting in Asia. You cannot piece together your own award. You can currently waitlist flights on UA metal and prepay for them (not sure if this is/will be possible after November 15). I have had success on the AKL-SFO route with this clearing 48 hours before departure.   
**Virgin Atlantic (VS)**  
Most of the talk with VS is about booking ANA to Japan. They have a great rate on NZ metal of 62.5k in J between the US and New Zealand (transfer bonuses put this between 48-55k). The issue is that this is the unicorn flight (unless you are flying May-August). There is award space released randomly, and Expert Flyer is your best bet. I have managed to book this award before.  A good option for May-August when NZ released more space.

  
**Strategy**   
I first decide what is my optimal booking. Do I want to fly CX, nonstop, stopover in Asia/Fiji? Then I look at how many seats I am trying to book. I then figure out when award seats open up for my desired booking. If I am not at that date, I monitor what award seats become available and if I think it will open up at schedule opening. If the schedule is already open, I search to see if there is availability. If there isn’t, I search for other routes. If I cannot find any award availability that pops up in searching, there are 3 main options I consider.   
\-Booking with ANA via Asia. You can create your own itinerary, and as long as you can find a TPAC to somewhere in Asia you should be able to stitch together a routing. This does take some time. 

\-Set Expert Flyer alerts for every nonstop NZ, UA, and AA nonstop flight that would work. Space does come available randomly.   
\-If there is UA economy saver space, waitlisting J via UA.   


I am willing to book a one-way flight and wait for a return flight. The only exception is mid-December through mid-January.   
Through the entire process, I keep in mind how many tickets I am trying to book.   
1 ticket- Higher likelihood of NZ award seat becoming available. Higher likely of AA seat becoming available within 90 days.   
2 tickets- Nonstop flights are still a possibility. NZ frequently only releases 1 J seat on many of their Asia routes at schedule opening so I count on them. A very doable number.   
3+ tickets- This gets tricky. I have seen UA release I9, which is at least 9 J award seats. This is not normal. The ANA route can be a little more difficult with 3+. The TPAC will be your most challenging flight, followed by the last flight to New Zealand, but there are frequently 3+ seats between New Zealand and Australia. UA waitlist on separate PNRs is a good backup if you can find saver Y.

edit: A lot of the routing rules and general information of this post apply when flying to Australia since almost all award charts combing Australia and New Zealand in the same region. The capacity to Australia is about 4-5 times greater than New Zealand and I have not included a breakdown of flights to Australia.","['Wow, thanks for these helpful notes/DPs.

One of my favorite things about NZ is the hiking. If you go past June-August/September a lot of the hikes that have elevation gains are not accessible due to avalanche risk and some due to ice/snow. We didn’t do one hike because of ice/snow. The weather was a lot of 40s-50s. Which is great if it is sunny and crappy if it is rainy. New Zealand is so green because it rains a lot and we have started always bringing rain pants, jackets, and decent umbrellas with us. A big negative at the time of year is sunrise is at 7:40 and sets at 5:40 and gets worse. You get 4-6 more hours of sunlight if you go Oct-early April (before clocks fall back). If you are in a campervan make sure that you get one that has propane heat (most don’t) if you plan on not staying at sites with electric. I paid $25 USD/day for mine in May.  If you go May-October(outside of school holidays) you don’t need to book ahead and can let your plans be dictated by the weather. I personally don’t think June-August is the best time since it is too cold to get in the water and a lot of the hiking is hampered. May is good.

I didn't realize before that there's not really an alternate route if part of it gets closed by snow.\n\nIt really depends on the weather.  If there is a storm it will probably be closed or chains be required. It is mainly the section by Queenstown and possible Arthurs Pass to worry about.  Saying that a bridge was washed out earlier this year that took several weeks to repair and the road was closed.  Arthurs Pass is a low level pass without great views and is not a great destination.  Many of the hikes involve going straight up and are not good options in winter. I would be willing to so the drive from Hokitika to CHC in a day.\n\n>If I'm there for 8 days, would you recommend a side trip to Milford Sound/Fiordland? If so is it a day trip from Queenstown or should I spend a night or more?\n\nIt is a full day. You are required to have chains in your car to drive on the road from Te Anau that time of year.  Too many tourists stuck/wrecked when the road conditions turned.  It is also the section of road with the highest accident rate in all of New Zealand.  I would try to fit in.  It is actually one of the attractions in NZ that is better with rain/not great weather. The tours that include transport from Queenstown are not actually that bad if there are 2 of you, it does get a lot cheaper to drive yourself if there are 4 people.\n\n>If my companions are there are 17 days and care about nature first and seeing civilization second, what's a good split for them between North and South Island?\n\nI would not spend more than 6 days on the north island.  It can be in fewer. If they wanted to do the Abel Tasman great walk or explore that portion of the north island, I might cut out the north island or do it in 3 days.  You can fly from regional airports to the south island to avoid backtracking to AKL or WLG (just check on the airport's website what rental companies operate from there).\n\n\n>Does a 4WD rental improve our reach or are roads just closed if a 4WD would be needed to traverse them?\n\nNew Zealand is big on requiring chains. Normally before they close roads they require chains and only close them if they need to.  A 4WD won't really get you more places. Getting chains with your rental will. \n\nDriving in New Zealand is exhausting. I actually look forward to driving on US-style highways again.  The main highway 1, has portions posted at 25kph.  On the south island, driving can take up to 25% longer if you are stuck behind campervans/trucks. Unless you plan on dropping your card off at a regional airport, I do not recommend renting from one of the worldwide rental companies.  The NZ ones have lower insurance excess and are often less than half the cost. Chains are also normally a cheap flat fee.  I think you can rent chains in Te Anau at the Mobil station too. Keep in mind with most NZ ones, you get the type of car that you rent. Bookme.co.nz and firsttable.co.nz are good discount websites. Also discount25 at Hitch car rentals has worked for about a year and gives 25% off, usually making them the cheapest."", 'Expert Flyer alerts at 330d and wait.

17,Offered free Gold Status on AA for 3 months even though I typically fly United. Worth booking upcoming flights on AA instead of United?,17,c2bqfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c2bqfl/offered_free_gold_status_on_aa_for_3_months_even/,45,1560942346.0,"I checked my e-mail today and found American Airlines offered me free gold status until 9/25. The promotion is to maintain gold through Jan 2021 by spending $850 EQD and going 7,000 EQMs by 9/25.

This came as a surprise as I am not a loyal AA flyer. I fly somewhat often for work, ranging from 3-6 days a month. I have 9.9K miles on AA, about 6K flown this year from trips to Vegas, Miami, and Boston.

&#x200B;

My upcoming trips (none of are booked yet):

\-RT DC to Madison for work (highly likely)

\-RT DC to Orlando for work

\-RT DC to San Francisco for work

\-1 way DC to Boston (other way is  on Jetblue, this was a personal trip so I went with who was cheaper)

&#x200B;

Looking at my trips above and roughly calculating cost, it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation. (I'll likely have one other work trip thrown in, but these are confirmed) which would get me to gold on AA through 2021. However, I typically fly United since I grew up near a hub and tried to stay somewhat loyal when convenient and/or affordable. I have 27K miles on United but not any status (and a RT flight to Spain booked on United). I was planning to book all of my above trips on United for this reason, to keep accruing miles.

&#x200B;

So my question is:

1. Should I switch plans and book all of my upcoming trips on AA instead of United to hit the promotion? Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?
2. Would it make sense to abandon loyalty to United and start flying AA going forward? I feel like if I switched to AA with the promotion I'm dividing up my miles and not really highly accruing on either (I'dbe about even on both airlines by Sept.)

&#x200B;

Some Notes:

\-I care more about being able to accrue miles (maybe to book a free trip in the near future) than say upgrades. The extra legroom perk would be nice since I'm tall but I wouldn't give up accruing more miles on one airline for that, especially since I can expense it for work flights on longer trips anyway.

\-I don't have a travel credit card except the Uber Barclays Card (3% cahs back regardless of brand).

\-I live close to DCA (an AA hub). United also flies out of DCA and has a hub in Dulles which isn't so far

\-I don't have strong feelings one way or the other about the brands. I've generally never had a problem on either.

\-For what it's worth, I'm silver on Marriott which has some kind of partnership with United

&#x200B;

Any help from those who are travel savvy or better understand the point system is appreciated!","['Stay with one airline. I am a loyal AAflier - 150+ flights last year, but we are suffering from lots of mechanical delays due to union struggles and there have been lots of weather issues. Also, not enough planes with Max grounding and the MD-80s coming out of service. I see no reason to diversify under the current conditions. Plus, with the combo of AA and US airways - gold means nothing, pretty much. So many people have status.', "" *it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought bonus/elite miles didn't count towards EQM, that's fixed."", ""This doesn't answer most of your questions, but Marriott status only gets you elevated United status if you're titanium elite or above, which is a long way from silver."", ""I agree with most other people in that AA gold isn't anything to get too excited about especially based on the perks you do care about. One thing worth considering is status match. If you can get AA gold, what would united match it to and since its your preferred airline would that be worth losing 7k+ miles for?"", '>Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?\n\nOne thing as /u/totallynotabotAF mentioned is your calculation for EQM is off. EQM is not the miles you accrue as 7x per $. That\'s just miles. EQM or ""Qualification Miles"" is different- it\'s equal to the physical miles flown between places. [http://www.gcmap.com/](http://www.gcmap.com/) is a great resource for calculating physical miles for your trips. For example, here are some numbers:\n\n \n\nDCA-MSN: 707 miles one way\n\nDCA-MCO: 759 miles one way\n\nDCA-SFO: 2,442 miles one way\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if you want to calculate the EQMs from the above trips, add them and multiply by 2 (round-trip). In your case, it is 7800 which is above 7,000 threshold. In general, coast-to-coast flying is the one which matters the most domestically to get EQMs.  $ 850 sounds doable for these 3 round trips easily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ""promotion"" you have been targeted for is called a status match in general, although it\'s not very common to be offered unless you already have a status with another airline. I like you don\'t care too much about upgrades etc. The only appeal of status to me is accruing more miles. I don\'t have strong opinions on accruing miles for 2 different programs vs. 1. On the negative side as you said it\'s fragmenting the miles, and when you need to book a free trip you don\'t have enough miles on either airline. On the plus side, a lot of these airlines devalue their points a lot. So if you have 100,000 United miles and suddenly they devalue it tomorrow, your points are worth a lot less suddenly. So then you can do more with your other miles. Although in US, it\'s common for all these airline programs to devalue it in sync (except Alaska which still has an excellent mileage program, but doesn\'t make sense for someone living in East Coast).', ""Gold isn't worth much tbh but the thresholds they've set you are pretty low.\n\nAlso not sure I agree with your loyalty to United (ex IAD I assume) vs American from a purely airport perspective. DCA is so much better than IAD."", ""The other point I didn't see after scanning is that DCA is a shitty AA hub, even taking into account that it's a shitty airline to begin with.  They only fly domestic out of there, so you can't get direct int'l rewards.  They also fly a lot of AA connection flights out of DCA, which are always delayed and a huge pain to deal with.\n\nUA has gotten their act together lately and flying out of IAD, while not a great airport or location, at least flights are generally on time and you can get good int'l routes.

You can transfer those Chase points 1:1 to United, so even if you've reduced flying United you can still continue accruing a lot of United miles at a rapid pace (because CSR is 3x for a lot of categories).

As a result, I decided to put together a little guide for how to technically book a one-way award ticket using ANA miles. The [original post with pictures can be found here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-202-one-way-award-tickets-on-ana/). If it seems like I missed anything, please feel free to let me know!

I will start with a brief primer on ANA for those that are not familiar with the airline, their transfer partners or their award chart. ANA’s award chart underwent a devaluation of sorts approximately a year ago. While devaluations are bad in general, the changes really were not that bad in the big scheme of things.

ANA also offers what is largely considered one of the best first class products in the sky.

[ANA First Class](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-2.jpg?w=480)

As well as a great (albeit boring color combination) business class product.

[ANA Business Class](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-3.jpg?w=930)

In addition, you can use ANA miles to book award tickets on any of the Star Alliance partner airlines. These include:

ANA partners with both American Express and SPG, so both your Membership Rewards points and your SPG Starpoints can be transferred to ANA. Your Membership Rewards points will transfer to ANA at a 1:1 ratio.

[Membership Rewards Points to ANA Miles Transfer Ratio](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-5.png?w=1022)

While your SPG points will also transfer at a 1:1 ratio.

Remember, if you transfer in chunks of 20k Starpoints, you will earn a 5k mile bonus so make sure you are taking full advantage of this!

**ANA'S AWARD CHART**

Like most airlines these days, ANA uses two different award charts – one for flights operated by ANA, and one for flights operated by their partners.

The [award chart for flights operated by ANA](http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/amc/reference/tukau/kokusai.html) uses a low, regular and high season system where you award costs will vary according to the date(s) of your flight(s). This will vary depending on the year, your origin and your destination, so it is worth reviewing before you transfer your hard earned Starpoints or Membership Rewards points.

The [award chart for flights operated by ANA’s partners](http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/amc/reference/tukau/teikeiair_1.html) uses a zone based system with no difference in redemption cost due to the date(s) of your travel(s).

**IMPORTANT NOTES ON ANA AWARD TICKET RULES**

It is worth noting that if your itinerary includes both ANA flights and a partner flight, you will be subject to the ANA partner award chart.

[ANA Rule](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-9.png?w=593)

It also important to know that ANA (much like Korean Air) only allows you to redeem miles for your family members – all of whom you will have to register (up to 10) in advance of ticketing your award ticket. This is how ANA defines “family members”:

[ANA Family Members](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-8.png?w=611)

Lastly, ANA requires that you book a round-trip ticket. You will notice there is no option to select on the award search page for a one-way ticket.

[ANA Main Search Page](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-10.png?w=752)

The relevant rule states that the departure airport and the final destination on the itinerary may differ, but must be in the same country.

[ANA Rule](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-11.png?w=667)

This is very important language and the key to being able to book a one-way award ticket using your ANA miles!

**HOW TO BOOK A ONE-WAY AWARD**

Given the language of the rule, that means an itinerary that went Orlando (MCO) to Chicago (ORD) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on the outbound and Tokyo Narita (NRT) to New York (JFK) on the return would be a valid routing because you both departed from, and returned to, the same country – the United States.

[ANA Valid Open-Jaw Routing](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-12.png?w=588)

That routing in economy would cost you 55,000 miles. Not a great redemption, but also not a horrible redemption all things considered.

[ANA Redemption Rate](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-13.png?w=963)

But what about if you actually just need the first segment from Orlando (MCO) to Tokyo Narita (NRT)? There is no option to search for a one-way award ticket, so you need to get a bit creative. Remember how the award ticket rules only said you had to return to the country you departed from? That means you can tack on a flight from somewhere like Monterrey Mexico (MTY) to Houston (IAH) to make your ticket a round-trip!

[ANA ""One-Way"" Routing](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-14.png?w=966)

As you can see, this satisfies the award ticket rules, and will only cost you 42,500 miles in economy. The segment from Monterrey (MTY) to Houston (IAH) will be a throw away ticket (i.e., one you have no intention of actually flying), but you could also use it down the road for the return segment of a later trip!

If you are returning to the United States, Air Canada and United usually have pretty good availability from Canada or Mexico to United’s hubs in the United States. Just keep plugging in your city pairs until you find something that has space available.

Again, this option will not necessarily create great value, but can be a good value if you run into a situation where you have one portion of your trip already booked, but cannot find one-way saver level award space on any airline that you have miles with. With a bit of creativity and knowledge/research on Star Alliance flights, you can really get this to work to your advantage if you are in a situation where you need a one-way award ticket that only ANA is showing availability for.

**Final Thoughts**

Not only does ANA offer some very generous redemption rates and routing rules, but they also offer a great product. While I do not generally recommend that travelers skirt the award ticket rules or book flights they have no intention of actually flying, this trick actually does comply with the ANA award ticket rules (not factoring in the throw away ticketing). Hopefully this helps give you some ideas for how to redeem your miles for a one-way ANA award ticket!","[""This is a great writeup.

This trip isn't for at least another year and I have over 220k miles to cover it but is it correct to assume that booking something like LH F via NH RTW miles isn't possible so far in advance?

So for example, if you flew my MCO-ORD-NRT/MTY-IAH routing your costs would be broken down as follows:\n\nMCO-ORD-NRT - Zone 6 (NA) to Zone 1-B using the partner award chart (because our MCO-ORD leg is on UA) is 55k miles RT. 1/2 of that is 27.5k miles. Thus, this half of the itinerary gets charged at 27.5k miles.\n\nMTY-IAH - Zone 6 (NA) to Zone 6 (NA) on the partner award chart (because this leg is on UA) is 30k miles RT. 1/2 of that is 15k miles. Thus, this half of the itinerary gets charged at 15k miles.\n\nWhen you combine the two halved mileage amounts, you get the final ticket price of 42.5k miles. Hopefully that's a better way of answering your question."", ""It depends on your origin and destination for both the departure and return.

As such, you\'ll end up paying a varying rate.', ""LH F definitely won't be bookable for partners until ~2 weeks before departure.

It shouldn't add very much mileage wise to the itinerary and EY is a NH partner."", '> This a solid write-up but how does it satisfy the following rule:\n\n> ""If the destination of your outbound trip and the point of departure of your inbound trip are different, they must be within the same area?""\n\n> Wouldn\'t that rule apply here so that your destination of your outbound trip is NRT and point of departure is MTY. Surely those aren\'t considered the same area? Am I missing something?\n\nFirst off, excellent eye on spotting this! I did not bring this up in my posting because it\'s somewhat next level in my opinion and I wanted to try and avoid confusing people.\n\nSo here\'s the deal. NH has rules (those that are thoroughly enforced on their face such as RT tickets only) and NH has ""rules"" (those that are a rule in theory, but have exceptions). The particular one that you quoted falls under the ""rules"" category. Scroll down on [this page](http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/amc/reference/tukau/kokusai_3.html) to look for the ""rule"" you quoted, then scroll down to the next ""rule"". The next ""rule"" states that:\n\n> ""For zones in which the destination of your outbound trip and the point of departure of your inbound trip are different, the required number of miles will be calculated by halving the required number of miles for each zone and adding them together.""\n\nIn other words, when you use this trick, you\'re essentially getting popped for half of the number of miles between each zone that you\'re flying - in my example Zone 6 (NA) to Zone 1-B (Japan) on the partner chart (remember if even one of your flights on your itinerary is on non-NH metal, you go off the partner chart), and then Zone 6 (NA/Mexico) to Zone 6 (NA/Mexico) on the partner chart. That works out to 27.5k miles for the departure and 15k miles for the return for a total of 42.5k.\n\nAs an aside, my use of quotation marks around rule may come off as me being condescending and that is in no way, shape or form my intention or my meaning. It\'s just the only way I could think of make it easy to differentiate between the two to explain why this works. Hopefully that helps answer your question!', ""What are the top sweet spots in the ANA award chart in your opinion?

25,Experience booking Emirates Business through JAL,26,6ybu1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6ybu1k/experience_booking_emirates_business_through_jal/,32,1504682955.0,"I made my first major award redemption today (yay me!) by booking two business class seats on Emirates through Japan Airlines (JAL) from the US to India and back. 

Prior to my reservations, I had about 159.5k SPG Points, 300k+ UR, 85k TYP, and around 140k AA miles. I was open to the idea of buying more points/miles to compensate any deficit and travel a little more comfortably as two economy tickets were going to cost me roughly $2000 anyway.

After having scoured the inter webs, I found a good number of options for booking these flights. Here's the breakdown of a few that I found:

- SPG points to Alaska to book on Cathay Pacific at 125k miles RT per person [decent, but I didn't quite like Cathay's business class product. Also, the HKK to India route was on Cathay Dragon.]

- American to fly either Qatar or Etihad at 140k miles RT per person [I could have moved my SPG points or bought AA miles. Didn't care too much to spend 280k miles on the flights, though. Approx. 3c/mile value]

- United to book Lufthansa at 160k miles RT per person [I wouldn't have minded flying Lufthansa, but that would mean I'd have to spend almost 320 UR OR buy and move a bunch of SPG points and that seemed a waste. Approx. 2.6c/mile value]

- SPG points to JAL to book on Cathay Pacific/Emirates/Qatar at 100k miles RT per person [This worked out the best as I had to transfer only 160k SPG points and was the cheapest in terms of redemption]

My first preference going into this was Qatar Airways because of the lie flat seats offered in the 777-ER, as well as the more modern design of the interiors in the aircraft. Unfortunately, I could not find availability on the dates that I needed - we weren't terribly constrained but could not find anything within a couple of weeks even. That left Emirates. 

I transferred 60k SPG points per day to JAL to ensure I received the additional 5k for every 20k. It took exactly 5 days for each transfer to appear in my JAL account.

With my 200k JAL miles, I called their phone reservation number (1-800-JAL-FONE (1-800-525-3663*)) only to be kept on hold for 40 minutes. I also lost network before I could make my reservations, which meant calling back and enduring another 30 minute wait. 

The agent who took my call was extremely friendly and was appreciative of the fact that I had all my flight information ready at hand. My flights were booked in all of 8 minutes, 2 of which went in making sure she spelt my wife's name correctly (the missus has a longish name). The agent wasn't able to ticket our reservations immediately because my wife and I do not share the same last name and for some reason, she needed proof of marriage. Easy enough to provide by scanning and emailing them our marriage certificate. Within a few minutes of doing so, our tickets were confirmed and I was able to select seats on the Emirates website. 

All in all, a pretty awesome experience. I wish I didn't have to wait that long on the phone to make my reservations, but I'll live with it for now. Taking into consideration the taxes and fees for the flights [$137 for both of us] and the $17.5 I spent on the 500 extra SPG points, I'm getting a value of a little over 5c/point on SPG [based on today's fares for the same flight] which I think is pretty decent. 

Now, I need to start replenishing my SPG account.

Update: I realized that I did not mention that I used Qantas and Alaska Air to look for award availability. I also signed up at Expert Flyer for more information.

For anyone attempting this, I'd suggest looking for flights one sector at a time. A lot of the flights I saw on Alaska and Qantas had mixed cabin availability which doesn't lead to a full business class experience.","['This is an awesome write-up.

I have 40-80k points on United, American, and Delta (each) and I don't think at this rate I'll ever get upgraded to first class or get free flights if I'm not doing things correctly.  I also have 60k points with Marriott.

I know I'm not traveling a ton, but I do go on 2-3 trips per month, so I figure that's enough that could add up.  

Can I convert points from one airline or hotel to another?

I'm thinking of consolidating and trying my best to only fly American.  Is this a good idea?

How do I make sure to maximize my benefits in the future?  Can I earn airline miles from my hotel stays and rental cars?  

My ultimate goal would be to get free airline tickets for my family.  If I can get upgraded seats during business travel, I wouldn't object - but the priority is getting free tickets for my wife and kids.","[""One thing you could do (although this would give you a fourth balance to look at) is open up an Alaska Airlines MileagePlan account and credit both your AA and Delta flights to Alaska since they're partners with both. That would still leave United plus your existing AA and Delta balances, but would help consolidate future miles earnings."", ""I know you can earn miles through Marriott. It's in your rewards account settings. Nice perk. \n\nWill your company let you book your own travel and then reimburse you? That's going to add up quick if you can."", ""As someone that travels occasionally for work, your ability to build any sort of large balance on airlines will be limited. Consistently using one brand will help but all three majors have limited the ability to earn miles to how much your ticket costs. For those of us that fly long haul in economy, it's killed any advantage we had in accruing miles. \n\nYou cannot convert points between airlines and hotels generally. Sometimes you can use credit cards to move from one to the other but there are large penalties involved there. \n\nWith certain programs you can choose to earn airline miles from hotel stays and rental cars. I can't remember off the top of my head which ones will do that but if you choose to earn airline miles instead of hotel points you almost certainly are going to be getting a much worse deal. \n\nDo you pay for airline tickets/hotels or do they go on a corporate card? "", ""One thing I don't see you mentioning is if you can choose the airline or if work picks it for you. If you can choose, based on the cities you've mentioned, stick to UA. You can get to both DEN and ORD direct from SNA as you've mentioned flying there a few times.\n\nMixing and matching your airlines like that isn't the best way if you're looking to truly rack up points and status (IE upgrades). "", ""You're honestly best off with Southwest given your destinations. If you're going to Montreal, fly American and credit to Alaska."", ""Award travel is basically a joke (not the sub, but the points). I've taken my talents to r/churning - then, combined with the points you make from traveling, you'll get much more out of them. Basically, since you spend money traveling, you should not look at hotels or airlines for points, but instead look at CC companies. "", 'Book hotels with rocketmiles, and pocket the airline miles.', ""you told us your home airport, but not where you tend to fly? your best bet is to stick with one airline, if you can. also, pick up a travel oriented credit card and get expensed out from work (if possible) instead of using a corporate card. also, what are your travel goals? do you like staying in upscale hotels, or will the run of the mill marriot/hilton's do for you? one of my favorite cards is the SPG AmEx due to the ability to transfer miles 1:1 to almost any airline rewards program. you earn points at the rate of 2 points per dollar spent. when trasnfering points from SPG to any airline, if you transfer 20k points, they give you a 20% bonus. so now your 20k is worth 25k to the airline. can't beat that deal. otherwise, look into the new chase sapphire reserve card with a $450 annual fee."", 'How do I move my delta points to alaska?', ""From where I'm at, Alaska hardly flies anywhere.  What you're saying is even with that, just choose to use both Delta and American but use my Alaska Frequent Flier number?  I wouldn't be able to redeem any decent travel since they don't fly many places from here."", ""It's in the Marriott rewards settings, or the airline rewards settings?"", 'Corporate card', ""Sadly, I've had many terrible experiences on UA.  Yes, it allows me to get to ORD directly, which is what I've taken a few times.  I also have to go to Montreal every so often, which UA does do from LAX.  \n\nI do get to pick who I fly.  "", ""I just signed up for the chase card everyone is raving about. Looks like it'll be worth it at this point like you mention. "", ""Thanks. I'll look into this. I have to use the internal system we have for travel most of the time but every so often I can use something like this.

Lately I've gone to Chicago a few times, and I'll have to go back.  I have gone to Atlanta, Columbus, Orlando, St Louis, Seattle, Portland, Denver.  Those are my most recent trips.  So unfortunately I don't just get to pick the one that's best to a single location."", ""You can't move them between programs, unfortunately."", ""Alaska actually has a great program that can get you just about anywhere you want to go thanks to their many partners. Delta and AA are partners, so you can use your Alaska miles to fly them, as well as several international airlines. It's definitely worth looking into more. Spend some time on Alaska's web site poking around and I bet you'll like what you see. There are also several good blog resources out there that will help you see what Alaska miles can do if you Google it."", 'Marriott. Under the ""Profile"" section in ""My Account"" there\'s a section for ""Earn Preferences"". I\'ve got it set to AA miles.', ""Can you change that and get reimbursed? \n\nFor instance, the Marriott card is great to stack bonuses in that you get 5% back on Marriott purchases on top of what you earn from the stay itself. Other airline/hotel cards work similarly. \n\nIf you're just relying on the stays to earn points/miles it's going to be a long slog to earn enough to get anything back. One thing that you can do is to get credit cards that have bonuses for the programs that you want to concentrate on. Chase cards, for instance, can transfer into the Marriott program to supplement what you earn. So you can get general Chase cards to bump up what you're already earning. \n\nI would look at the links on the right side of the page and start getting familiar with them. The possibilities are endless and each person will have a different strategy for what they are comfortable with and what they can pull off.

They tend to frown on us for this.  I can to a small point, but often I hear colleagues getting in trouble for this, as we're supposed to use our Amex as close to 100% of the time as possible.

You can just enter your Alaska number on future reservations and credit your flights to them instead.', 'Call Amex - I had the same situation. They allowed me to pay the membership rewards annual fee ($75 at the time) and I would then earn points on all Amex transactions on the corporate card.

Unfortunately I wasted a bunch on an Amazon transfer not realizing the low transfer rate. So from now on I'm letting them rack up, I'm sure I'll find something better. ""]"

**Learnings**

* Get your miles ASAP. I had been looking for HNL - SYD flights in J and I was contemplating splitting up people into different flights or fare class. One hazy night, I found 6 in J on the same flight. I booked it immediately, because I knew it was a unicorn. If I didn't have 390k AA in an account, one could've been snatched from me. Another example was that the [Australian call center](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-airlines-aadvantage/1738929-booking-aa-award-travel-etihad-ey-master-thread-july-2017-onwards.html) trick had ""closed"", meaning I thought I had another 4 months to accumulate miles. Welp, the loophole opened back up the next week and I had to scramble to do in a week what I thought I had 4 months to do.

* Do you research on how many premium award seats will get released. AUH to ORD on EY only has award J availability for 2. If you're waiting to get 6 seats, that's not going to happen. I got dinged for changing my destination to JFK.

* Keep some mystery on the things you're excited for. I had read too many trip reports on the Etihad First Class Apartment, I watched every YouTube video on it & interviewed people about their experience...so I knew every exact detail and set my expectations way too high that they'd never be met. I enjoyed it, but would've enjoyed it much more had there been mystery around it.

* I tried to avoid YQ like the plague, so that's why I chose some of the flights that I did. Probably should've been less of a miser there, but I think it worked out really well.

I made dreams come true & got a commemorative mug for it. Could I have used my miles more efficiently? Probably, but (KanyeShrug).

P.S. Obligatory thanks for the help, internet!

**Update 1**

**Tools I used**

* 7 or 8 months in advance, I would first look on Kayak to find routes & times that would be convenient.

* Then after I picked the top 3 routes & times, I would study the most efficient way to fly that route. Would it make sense to transfer points into that program or use a partner? Does one have YQ and the other not?

* From there, ExpertFlyer was incredibly helpful for looking for award availability. I started booking 6 months in advance. It gets easier once you get away from the US.

* I pretty much have this as my wallpaper [WellTraveledMile transferable points chart](https://welltraveledmile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Airline_Transfer_Partner_Guide_Airlines_Update_dec16.png)

* I am also part of meetups, FB groups, Slack channels, browse Reddit, went to FTU, read blogs and occasionally look at FT. People are REALLY helpful if you have an EXACT question. People hate it when you don't think for yourself & have to spoonfeed you answers.

**Taxes & Fees**

* (MSP - HNL) - DL Economy Comfort - $0 (booked via UR portal)*6 = $0

* (SEA - HNL) - DL J - $21.60

* (HNL - SYD) - HA J - $30.40*6 = $182.40

* (SYD - OOL) - 3 QF J & 3 QF Y - $15.90*6 = $95.40

* (OOL - SYD) - VA Y - $0 (booked via UR portal)*6 = $0

* (SYD - AUH) - 2 EY F & 4 EY J - $74.60*2 + $74.70*4 = $448

* (AUH - JFK) - 6 EY J - $49.16*6 = $294.96

**Total in fees for flights paid:** $1,042.36

**Total retail value of flights:** $89,174

**Total retail value of hotels:** $7,379 + $1,278 (paid in cash) = $8,657

30,2020: Year of Festivals,32,9z9q3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9z9q3h/2020_year_of_festivals/,38,1542880996.0,"I work for myself and am able to work remotely, so I have a lot of travel flexibility.  I had this crazy idea about traveling in the year 2020 around a  festival/event theme: going to places with some of the more interesting cultural festivals/events around the world.  The tentative schedule I've put together:

&#x200B;

Tuna throwing festival in Port Lincoln, Australia: January 26

Snow festival in Sapporo, Japan: February 3 - 10 (EDIT: now thinking of dropping this in favor of the Olympics in July/August in Tokyo)

Battle of the Oranges in Ivrea, Italy: February 22 - 25

Chiditarod in Chicago, USA: March 7

Calcio Storico in Florence, Italy: semifinals in early June, final is on June 24

Euro 2020 football (soccer) tournament throughout Europe: June 12 to July 12

EDIT: Now looking at adding in the Tokyo Olympics in early August and then the Fringe festival in Edinborough in mid August

La Tomatina in Bunol, Spain: August 26

International Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque, USA: October 3 - 11

Dia de Los Muertos, Mexico City (or Oaxaca), Mexico:  November 2

Cayman Pirates Week, Grand Cayman: mid November

&#x200B;

So I can't just travel the whole year, but there are some distinct trips that I feel like I could build with this agenda.  I'm thinking:

&#x200B;

**Trip 1**

January 19ish: fly to Melbourne and go to the Australian Open.  One of my bucket list items is to attend all 4 tennis grand slams...so far I've done the US and the French.  If I'm going to Australia in January anyway, this seems like a no brainer.  I've been to Australia before but only Sydney and Cairns.

January 25: fly over to Port Lincoln and attend the tuna throwing festival

January 27: Fly to New Zealand.  I've never been and it's high on my list.

February 7ish: Fly to Sapporo and attend the closing couple days of the snow festival.  Maybe I could spend a few more days in Japan...not sure where else I'd go in Winter.  I've been to Tokyo and Kyoto before.  EDIT: Now thinking of dropping this out of the trip and heading straight from New Zealand to Rome.

February 11ish: Fly to Rome, which I've been to before but it's been 20 years.  Head down to southern Italy which I've never been to before.

February 21ish: Head up to Ivrea which is near Turin and attend the Battle of the Oranges.

February 26ish (or maybe I spend a bit more time in Europe): Fly home to Chicago.

March 7th: Attend Chiditarod.

&#x200B;

**Trip 2**

Mid May: Fly to Europe.  Hit up some places I'd like to go: Switzerland (never been), Paris (would love to go back to the French Open), Venice (never been).  Then go to the Calcio Storico in Florence for the semifinals in early-ish June (dates TBA).  Then on to a group stage Euros match

Mid June: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

**Trip 3**

EDIT: Now thinking of flying to Tokyo in early August for the Olympics then heading to Edinborough for the Fringe Festival before proceeding on to Spain.

August 23ish: Fly to Spain.  Work my way over to Bunol for La Tomatina on the 26th.  Then head North and potentially explore non-Paris France (never been), Belgium (never been), the Netherlands (I've been to Amsterdam 20 years ago).

Late September: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

The rest of the events at the end of the year are straightforward flights in/out within North America/Caribbean.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking that I will want to use miles for:

USA to Australia (business)

New Zealand to Japan (business)

Japan to Italy (business)

Italy to USA (economy)

USA to Europe in May (business)

Europe to USA in June (economy)

USA to Europe in August (business)

Europe to USA in September (economy)

&#x200B;

Everything else I think I could just pay cash.

&#x200B;

So of course all these dates are too far out to check for award availability.  But I'd like to talk through my options and what is likely to be available to see if I can pull this off or if I need to make adjustments.  Here's my miles/points stash:

Amex: 95K

Merrill Lynch: 28K

Alaska: 137K (will soon get add'l 40K bonus)

American Airlines: 124K

BA: 6.5K

Delta: 35K

Southwest: 36K

United: 43K (though I suspect I'll need to use 30K for travel in May 2019)

Choice: 8K

Hilton: 47K

Hyatt: 57K

IHG: 20K

Radisson: 119K

Wyndham: 20K

&#x200B;

I've done a little bit of proof of concept award travel search seeing if I could find the awards I need if I was doing this trip in 2019 instead of 2020.  I had success with everything except how to get to Australia with business class.  Of course I am searching just a month and a half out for Australia so that may be why there's no availability.  Here was my tentative plan for paying for this stuff with points.

&#x200B;

USA to Australia (business): I'm not sure how to crack this one because business class award availability to Australia is so tough.  Using Alaska miles to fly Cathay through Hong Kong seems like the most likely option?  If I ended up having a stopover for a couple of days in Hong Kong that would be totally cool as I've never been there before.  I really don't know if availability will be there for January 2020 if I start searching in February 2020.  Unfortunately, this is when I am least flexible in terms of timing: January is my busiest work time of year.  I'm going to work like the dickens the first 2 weeks of January 2020 to put as much to bed as possible but I really can't leave the USA in those first 2 weeks.

New Zealand to Japan (business): Looks like I can do this for just 40K AA miles.  There's availability for this in 2019 on Malaysian Air so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Japan to Italy (business): Can do this for 75K AA miles. There's availability for this in 2019 on BA so I'd hope there'd be availability in 2020.  I was worried the YQ surcharges would be really bad but it's only $200.

Italy to USA (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in May (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in June (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in August (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in September (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

&#x200B;

So I need 95K more Amex points but I figure I can find a way to make that happen.

&#x200B;

**My Questions**

1. Are there any great festivals I'm missing?  I considered Carnivale in Brazil or Mardi Gras in New Orleans, but I'm really just not sure the former is for me, and in any case this Battle of the Oranges seemed too cool to miss.  Though maybe I'm doubling up on that sort of thing if I'm going to La Tomatina.  I've been to Oktoberfest or that would be on the list for sure.  I suppose I could still go back during my Aug/Sep Europe trip.
2. Is there a better way to spend award points to make this trip come together?  Or credit cards I can get to get some points I need to do this better?  I'm way over 5/24.
3. Getting to Australia especially: I'm really concerned that I won't find availability on Cathay with Alaska miles in the tight window I will be looking and then I'm screwed.  Ideas?

You're planning a lot of flights with specific date ranges and the assumption that you'll be able to lock in the sweetest spots in the award charts. On top of this, you're assuming that award charts won't devalue. These are bad assumptions.\n\nIf you were my client, I'd be advising you to get as many transferable points as you can. Check out the new Capital One Venture card, and if you're eligible for Amex bonuses, work as many of these as possible. With as many trips as you're taking, you'll want to focus on transferable points but you might also do well with, say, a Delta points balance (these can be great for intra-Asia flights on China Airlines). The more points you have, the better your chances of being able to make this work.\n\nIs it possible that you'll get lucky? Sure.

There are a shitload of all night festivals in the summer time in Japan that will probably be the only time a foreigner will see Japanese people really let loose.

Grain of salt is that I never went but heard from friends who have gone"", ""So I don't know how I didn't think of the Olympics....obviously a huge miss.  I'm trying to figure out how I could make it work as 1) I don't seem to have enough points what with everything else I had planned and 2) I'm guessing award flights (especially business class) will be very hard to come by around the Olympics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdeas?  I'd be willing to sacrifice the Sapporo snow festival for the Tokyo Olympics so that could save me 30K AA miles as instead of going AKL to NRT (40K miles) and then NRT to FCO (75K miles) I could just do AKL to FCO for 85K miles on Qatar Air.  And if I went straight from the Olympics in Tokyo to the UK for the Fringe festival and then down to La Tomatina that saves me the 55K Amex points for flying from the US to Europe.  But I don't know how those points are going to get me from USA to Japan and then Japan to Europe since awards will probably be non-existent?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: So one thought would be to use Hawaii as an intermediary.  I could fly from mainland US to Honolulu (never been) for a few days and then go on to Tokyo.  This would allow me to avoid business class as both those flights could be done during daytime hours i.e. not overnights.  Prices would be a lot more reasonable in economy and maybe I could get a Hawaiian card and do one of the legs for free.  But then I've still got to figure out how to get from Tokyo to the UK for the Fringe festival.  I don't really have the miles to pull that off in businesss class which it would have to be for that beast of a flight.

I had the card a long time ago but downgraded it to a Quiksilver or something like that, so I figure I\'m eligible again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'ve had the Amex Platinum and the Business Gold Rewards.  That Amex BGR is the last Amex card I\'ve received, got that in July.  So I doubt they\'ll give me an Amex Platinum business so closely on the heels of that.  The last Amex personal card I got was back in December so I think I could jump back in that pool.  So I guess there\'s the Amex Platinum Schwab and Morgan Stanley.  Best offer for those is 60K I believe.  I\'m also thinking Hawaiian miles could be useful as I could use them to break up trans-Pacific trips into manageable economy legs rather than having to find business award availability to cross the whole ocean at once.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you have any thoughts on the getting from the USA to Australia challenge?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: My ""use Honolulu to break up the trip"" strategy could work for USA to Australia.

This was my three week honeymoon. We chose this odd routing because I ended up with too many JAL miles after Marriott transfer and rather than let them sit during the  JAL devaluation last year, we figured we use them. 

I also wanted to fly EY too before any future devaluations make it too difficult to redeem. 

Aside from the gold, the caviar, Hennessy Paradís from Emirates, and the large real estate from EY, my calling for these airline was the fact that they often had couple availability in advance. This was the key in selecting the airline for our honeymoon.

To collect our miles, I had 4 player mode activated. Thanks mom dad and wifey. Yes I take my parents out on flights too. (EVA J next for a family of 5!!)

I feel like after the numerous flights and hotels, I learned a significant amount and would love to share a few things. 

Here is the outline I use for flights:

Preflight/Lounge 
Hard Product
Soft Product
Additional notes

EK Lounges. We stopped by one in SFO which was quite pleasant. A ton of food offerings and was very clean and polished. The partner lounge in BCN was basically a cheap whore of a lounge that every premium passenger uses and abuses. It was horrifyingly busy and a madhouse. 

We went to two lounges in Dubai- C and A gate lounge.  If you fancy, head straight to the spa and book your complimentary treatment because at the A terminal lounge , it is outside and sometimes appointments aren’t readily available. The therapist straight elbowed the crap out of my back but my wife’s treatments were good. Proceed with caution. The lounges in Dubai are ridiculously huge. The one in A spans all of the A gates and you can board from the lounge. I would take a wild guess that there is a ratio of 10 workers to 1  passenger during the times we were there. The Dubai Lounge restaurant dining was pretty spectacular. You can order what you want so we tried almost everything. I really enjoy Arabic and Indian foods in general and if you do too, stick to these options. They had some meatballs in a yogurt sauce called Kibbe bil labban that was unforgettable. Almost all of the Middle Eastern options on this trip in general had an upper hand on alternative cuisine. The lounge also had buffet options, too, but I would stick with the seated dining if you have the time. And if you are ever there, definitely save room for the emirates sandwich. Try to eat one right before your flight like I did, after eating two entrees... more on stuffing your face with lounge food later. 

They have quiet rooms in the A Gate Lounge that offer two types of sleepers. Try to get the one with the ottoman because the odd shaped sleepers are , you guessed it, odd. Blankets, pillows and masks were provided without asking. This was super thoughtful. The bathrooms are stocked with toothbrushes and are super clean. 

EK Hard Product- SFO-DXB was magical as it was our first international F. The bling, the IFE, the controls for the doors were all very overwhelming at first, but became second nature midway throughout the flight. Suite doors don’t close until after takeoff but when they do, there is a good amount of privacy, especially if traveling solo. If you are with someone else, however, and say you have the the partition down, the suite doors are pretty low so that the flight attendants cab see you from the opposite aisle (if they were walking down from my wife’s side, they would easily see me). The one great thing about the suites are that they are generous with storage compartments.  Also there is something nice about having the ability to control your seat and recline to a bed when you want. While I know it’s expected of first class to have the flight attendants set up your bed and all, that’s just not me. I happily let them do it the first couple of times, but after that, it was faster if I did it.  

The main issue I had with the suite was that it was just too damn hot. I slept in my undies at one point (on the first flight but realized the whole partition visibility issue). Air ventilation was poor in almost all of my flights. There are two are vents that can be adjusted. But it was not enough. 

The bathrooms are more amazing than pictures and videos can describe. I sit here writing this after I just brushed my teeth in AA’s tiny, unkept business bathroom (first was blocked off for service). I had to take a moment to just realize how lucky I was just a couple weeks ago to be in a bathroom so big. It was STOCKED with amenities, some quality shit too. Razors, combs, shampoo, bvulgari soap and cologne. Really impressive. Oh and the floors were heated... 

Unfortunately the sfo-dxb was the only A380 that served us flawlessly. The 777 we took to MLE was super old. Tiny bathroom, old IFE, smaller tv.  Still a suite tho. The A380 to and from Barcelona had IFE issues and for some reason didn’t have heated floors. Oh well.  

Showering on a plane... I understand why flying halfway across the world in first class makes sense. Aside from the quality of sleep, when you shower after you have sweated in an economy seat or even business, you don’t feel like a million bucks. Sure you could wash your face and brush your teeth. Maybe even scrub your pits with the faucet + other things. But showering in the air right before you land is a feeling like no other. That said, I did skip a shower because I didn’t feel it was necessary during a 6 hour flight to BCN. But after 16 hours, SUPER grateful to walk out of that plane feeling fresh. 

Let’s talk about what really called me to Emirates, food and drinks. Many people already know not to drink the ground champagne and save for the premium stuff after take off (except in MLE, dom was served on the ground. Same rule applies for lounge drinks. I rarely, if ever hear, hear from others to stuff your face before the flight at premium lounges. 

Aside from the excellent, well presented caviar service and perhaps my braised brisket, nothing really stood out in terms of on board food. This leads me to say, stuff your face at the DXB lounge where food is of quality and freshly prepared, vs the catered stuff that is reheated. Sure the food is better than ANYTHING I have ever been served in any other airline, but yeah, I used to find myself drooling, reading other blogs and  looking at photos. The reality is, it is not all that. Comparing apples to apples, by airline food standards, sure this stuff is good, maybe even great. But don’t expect superb quality. Expect something of a meal which you can get for under 100/150$ + caviar. 

Hennessy Paradís is strong AF. Hennessy is literally my choice of beverage. Neat to sip or shots without any chaser. This stuff they served on the plane was EXTRA strong. Made your nose hairs tingle. After drinking so much at my wedding, I was just not in the mood for more liquor. Champagne on the other hand was quite nice, especially the super bubbly stuff like Dom. 

One last thing about food and bev is don’t be afraid to ask for a few things. Especially when the flights are empty. I regret only trying the mezze platter on one flight and not getting the caviar. The purser hyped it up for me. I would have regretted it less if the mezze platter wasn’t so bland and boring (I got plenty in the Middle East and yeah the Emirates version wasn’t that great). I see some bloggers getting huge servings of caviar vs. what I received on my flights. I can’t get too mad since the purser did give me pyjamas ( I love the alternative spelling and pronouncing it like peejamas) on a short day flight. 

Speaking of pajamas, in combination with amenity kits,  make great souvenirs. And while they don’t offer it on all flights, ask your purser! I felt bad because I straight up saw someone on my BCN-DXB flight ask for a kit and got rejected by the attendant. So I pretended that I didn’t see or hear and I asked the purser. Winning. I did feel bad that this man didn’t get his, although from the sound of the conversation, he was connecting on a longer flight. And I losrt sympathy after he literally attempted to try everything on the menu. All in all my wife and I got 6 pyjamas and 6 amenity kits which wasn’t enough for our large families, but it definitely covered a great chunk of our souvenirs (we kept one set each because why not?) The kits were by bvlgari and included some quality skin care products among other things.

Lastly for emirates, I would say we were absolutely wowed by their systems and services. By system I mean the fact that each time they ran through coffee dates magazines introduction off purser etc etc. it didn’t get old. When they know you have been in the suites before they will skip some of the unnecessary stuff. Our flight attendants were troopers. They really do try to provide a truly amazing experience. The unfortunate thing is while I read that they can’t tell if you paid or use miles for first class, you stand out like a sore thumb based on what you wear. Fortunately we were not discriminated against based off our inability to pay full price. Not that it mattered during the emirates legs of our trip, but I figure it could matter in certain situations...

EY!

The partner lounge in the Maldives was mediocre. If we weren’t so hungry, we could have skipped it altogether. We also went to the priority pass  lounge because it was outside of security and again really hungry (we normally skipped lunch at the Maldives and we were coming around the time of afternoon tea/happy hour).

The lounge in Abu Dhabi, however, was super fancy. I showed up in a cutoff t shirt and shorts and slippers from the Maldives. At this point I didn’t care to change, but we definitely stood out. 

I did request to book the “VIP” room AKA The Residence. We used it to sleep and they gave us pajamas (It was good because we had no intention of keeping our ones for the flight because it would be used for, you guessed it, more souvenirs!) The only unpleasant thing was they missed our wake up call so we essentially rushed breakfast and rushed to our gate. Somewhat disappointing. We ended up getting delayed 12 hours so we spent more time in the lounge than we needed. 

The bartender and dining staff were all super attentive aside from the wake up call. Again the middle eastern foods were the go to here. I had a lamb josh Rogan and a chicken breast with roti. Both superb. We also had kimchi pancakes for breakfast and those, although soggier than anticipated, were quite nice. The great thing about this lounge is they serve the same champagne they serve in air  so I didn’t feel guilty boozing it up before my flight. The alcoholic offerings here were also more diverse than the limited plane offerings. The bartender even suggested I add cucumber in my Hendricks gin and tonic. Hat tip to you my friend. 

While they had sleepers at this lounge, it wasn’t really a quiet zone type of area. It had sliding doors, and a bunch of tvs. It was bright, right by the bar, and not an optimal environment for sleeping. No blankets readily available either, although I’m sure the concierge would give it to you if you asked... but why do you have to ask? 

At the spa, I had a complimentary eye message. I tipped my therapist 5$ USD. I waited for my wife outside and gave her the money for the tip. The manager said they don’t take tips. I felt  bad that one therapist received one and the other didn’t. It would have been more pleasant if my therapist rejected it too so that it was fair. 

One more thing before going on with the flights was we got flightscrimminated against twice. Once at security in the Maldives and once right before boarding A380 first class. In the Maldives, we didn’t even know there was a business class security check in entrance. Not like it mattered because the lines were empty. But this fool tried to say business class only and my wife and I were like good this is our line then. It wasn’t stated in a way where he was trying to be helpful. More like, look you don’t look like J class so you shouldn’t be in that line. The following day we were especially agitated at the staff person splitting up economy and premium cabins on the a380 (premium boards upstairs). He swung his arm out and said economy is that way. And I said no we are flying first. I pull out my ticket and said once again, first. His eyes widened in disbelief that this couple, in sandals, could be flying something other than economy, let alone first. Sure, we didn’t pay cash fares, BUT STILL. 

One last thing was that I wished first class passengers would be escorted to lounges and gates. Idk if that is too much to ask for but a 6 seater first class cabin doesn’t sound like too much. While there are double the number of F passengers in emirates, I still don’t think it is too much. They don’t even board first class first. Maybe I’m seeking special attention, but if I (hypothetically) paid 3-4 times more than business, then yeah, I should probably be the first one to put my stuff down and relax. 

The hard product, I have to say was mind blowing in a practical and real estate sense. Sure you don’t get a tablet to watch with, or a bar that opens with the press of a button. The main functions of the suite were all manual including the sliding doors, bed and mini bar. It was all completely fine by my standard. The seat was very large. And to top it off, the bed was super comfortable because it was flat which my body is more accustomed to. It was nice to be able to switch between seat and bed vs. having to recline and undo your chair. And since there were only three of us in F, we used the other suite as our dining room. The bathroom was about half the size as Emirates though. I really do appreciate large bathrooms after this trip... One bathroom is bigger than the other because there is no shower, so if you just need to poop or whatever, try to go to that one. Storage though was quite limited. There were multiple compartments but all relatively small, especially the closet for hanging your clothes. All in all, I really appreciated the larger lounging suite and the fact that there are only 6 of them makes for more personalized service.

For J class leaving the Maldives, the product was solid. I was a bit bitter because we were in originally in F, then they switched to a two class plane and when they switched us, all the “couple seats” were gone. Big lesson, call and book your seats right away. While we still sat “next” to each other, there was somewhat of a divider between us that catered for individual travelers. While it was designed for privacy, there was a lack of privacy between my seat and the aisle seat. It would have probably made more sense for my wife to take the window seat as I  felt  was closer to that passenger. It was a bit awkward but it was a short flight anyway. The bathroom was nothing to write home about. The IFE was quite responsive and the seat was perfectly fine aside for the lack of privacy. I would definitely recommend the couple seats though as they are directly side by side, spooning certified.  The design of the couple seat gives a good amount of space between you and the aisle seats. It’s actually quite frustrating recalling how the couple seats were every other row. Whether they want to make more seats available for individual passengers or if it is a space thing, it was just meh.

Food and bev, I’ll limit my words on J class meals as you can already tell I’m not too privy for airline food. Again stick with the Middle eastern options and you should be fine. F class however, was a game changer. There is something about having an actual chef on board that elevated the experience. Again, not 5 star food and also probably $150 and under meal, the fact that they try to cook most things on board is excellent. While it was interesting and worrisome to see that his role was not exclusively a chef but also flight attendant at times, his culinary expertise spoke through his food. The meals were hot and fresh. The beef was actually a little chewy so I would say that perhaps it wasn’t of great quality, but the execution and delivery is where they stand out. The food was HOT, not warmed. The Robyan Tahta had delicious fatty prawns. The steak Etihad steak sandwich was rich. Unfortunately the lobster roll was a bit bland and had a small ratio of lobster to bread. The accompaniments if the steak frites were awesome tho. Their mezze platter was simpler and more delicious than emirates. It was nice to have your own (mini) tin of caviar, but the presentation was not as nice or as elegant as emirates. 

In terms of amenity kits, they give really nice and soft pajamas that were branded with Etihad. Really impressed by these. The flight attendant originally gave me a medium and I asked for a large because “I like to wear bigger clothes” but  in reality, they were for a family member. She said trust me medium would be best for you but you can have both! Yay! My wife and I will share this extra pair. The ones they gave us in the lounge, I believe were the older ones. While the ones in the lounge looked cooler with the gold zipper, the newer ones are extremely light in material and have this cool Etihad brand in the bottom. I didn’t open the aqua di Parma kit, but you can find that stuff online. I did try some of their products in the bathroom and during my shower and can confirm it smells like old rich people. It has that smell of old people but subtle, not as intense. I also appreciated the noise canceling Bose headphones. Im not a headphone connoisseur, but most Americans know Bose due to their quality. I enjoyed the fitting too. 

Closing thoughts on Etihad- I think I would definitely fly them again going back to the Middle East. Although they don’t fly out of SFO, I think the LAX to AUH might be the go to but further research will go into that before booking EY F again. Our AUH to JFK was sadly too short (13 hours only am I right?). 

One thing I hope doesn’t happen if you ever fly with EY is your flight gets delayed... because Etihad was a shit show  when it came to communication. They did not communicate to the monitors so we walked to the gate. They did not communicate to the customs agents so we were not allowed out to exit at first. They provided a hotel but did not communicate to the staff how to handle transportation. Our car never came and a hotel staff person drove us. Can you believe that? Then they booked our connecting jfk-sfo in Y. While it was a simple fix, it shouldn’t have even been something I had to call in for. I hate to leave with such a negative closing thought, but the chance of a 12 hour delay appears to be minimal. The great news is that I learned something. Book with a credit card with travel insurance. Now before you skip over this teachable moment, as a points and miles collector, it’s easy to put your flights on your minimum spend card and then cancel it when the AF is due. Never again.  My wife and I have always paid for the CSR AF and will no longer book with any other card, even if it means missing out on 5X MR on the Amex Plat. Fortunately the airline took care of us, but that might not always be the case!

Hotels

Park Hyatt Vendome. Super luxury. Been here before. Took a train from Barcelona to Paris because we love Paris. Part of that love is due to this hotel. Serious luxury. Even ran into a very famous American actor. It was funny because I thought I saw him riding his bike while in a taxi coming from the train station. My wife thought I was TRIPPING. Then, we saw him try to get out of the elevator on the wrong floor, so we got to share an elevator convo. I casually addressed him by his first name. He did indeed confirm he was riding his bike. We just couldn’t believe it. We were star struck.  Also worth mentioning , the hotel provided us with champagne and Macaroons for our honeymoon. Great touch!

Al Maha

This was probably my favorite hotel in terms of uniqueness, food, and the amazing suite we got. Being in the desert, gazelles at your door and backyard, seeing oryx and their large horns was extremely dope. However if you aren’t the camping type, I would avoid this like the plague. This was like super glamping and if you can’t stand the smell of animals or bugs stay away because there are plenty of it. 

Let’s get to the room. I think the front desk really hooked it up because upon check out, the manager thanked me for my ambassador status told me that it was not easy to get that status. L.O.L.  We got upgraded to the royal suite. A $3000-4000 room with two bedrooms, a living room and a private pool, with champagne and Arabic dessert platter. The nespresso set shockingly impressive. A top of the line machine, nespresso branded cups and at least 6 flavors with 6 pods each. WTH?! Oh and literally like 12 bottles of regular sized water and 4 - liter bottles. Bvlgari products, bath tea bags, seriously the works. This used to be an emirates property before spg, now Marriott, which shows through the bling and soap. 

The full board was what really stood out here. In room Breakfast was spectacular and dinner was amazing. Got some biriyani and the presentation and accompaniments were the best I had on this trip ( probably had at least 4 biriyanis in 3 weeks)   Unfortunately for lunch we got kinda screwed. We didn’t know there were certain hours for the restaurant. Same offerings as in room but we wanted to eat lunch at the restaurant because we didn’t want to be late for our excursion. In hindsight room service is FAST. Oh and don’t order the pizza. Lol. Another thing is if you fancy nice butter, they serve echrie butter here. Fatty and salty. Delicious. 

For desert activities, we did the camel trek and the dune bashing. We actually were offered a third excursion because dune bashing was a paid activity, but due to a sand storm during check out, we could not complete our archery. Dune bashing was meh. I got sick. My wife was dizzy, the other car, someone threw up. It wasn’t as cool as I thought it was. Riding a camel was pretty cool. The way they get up and down was unique. Expect to walk funny the next day lol. 

Conrad Maldives.

Oh fucking wow. This was my favorite destination. I honesty wish we stayed longer. 5 days was not enough in paradise. We used 4 weekend night certificates plus 95k hilton points. Our stays was a check in on Saturday and check out Wednesday. HUCA am I right?

At first I was scared to be island locked. I am the type to get bored easily, I was afraid of $100+ bar dinners every night. But this was far from the case. The property consists  of two islands and there are so many free activities. We did paddle boating, stand up paddle board, and snorkeling. I could snorkel every day and I’m not even that into fish. It was so fun swimming though channels, exploring your backyard. I didn’t even think about snorkeling until we got there. But they had a excellent house reef and decent snorkeling gear. We even took a boxercise class that ended up being a private lesson. They also offer a 30 minute photo shoot.  Perfect for couples because they do a fantastic job and no pressure to buy (surprisingly didn’t even offer- he was chill). they make for great memories, so if anything bring nice clothes for this. 

Because we were on our honeymoon, we were given one free three course dinner for our honeymoon ($200), a one hundred dollar spa treatment, shisha session (30 USD value) + the usual, afternoon tea and happy hour everyday, free breakfast. The spa credit and shisha were a surprise as this was not included in the welcome email. They also hooked it up with half a bottle of champagne, and truffles and hella fresh fruit which was perfect after snorkeling. Be aware they ask for a wedding certificate. Because we left right after our honeymoon we did not have that. A wedding invitation and or wedding website did suffice!! This was such a great value! 

Lastly, they honored my late check out request by allowing us access to a day use villa. We literally got to try out the beach villa for a few hours on our last day. This was super accommodating of them due to the reason that someone had already booked our water villa. 

I was surprised by how much we spent. It was far less than I anticipated. Sure we had cup noodles three nights and took home a couple sandwiches from happy hour. Late breakfasts and afternoon tea plus the free three course honeymoon dinner really helped out. 

We literally spent way too much money in Europe. I think it was a mix of, “Oh we are on our honeymoon/oh we are only in Paris/BCN for a short while, let’s eat our hearts out.” When we got to the Maldives, we had already blown through our food budget. Nearing the end of our trip and considering how much we ate out and how much we ate in general in the past two weeks, we were content with 3 dinners of cup of noodles. This helped us with our splurge on dinner at Ithaa. A lot of people complain that the afternoon drink isn’t worth it and it probably isn’t. And judging by the chicken breast served at lunch and the fact that skipping lunch is the more reasonable thing to do, I would guess lunch probably isn’t worth it either. But dinner was actually fun. While a 7 course menu sounds like a lot of food, it was just enough- a significant amount of food for Maldives standards, but obviously not the size of your average 7 course dinner. I eat a lot and I didn’t leave full, but satiated.  Great ambiance and great company. Oh yes and more caviar. Season your own food because I think they don’t add salt as they provide 4 different types of salt. When the portions are that small, you get through half after a couple of bites then you remember  you need to season and you are like, well shit. Pro tip right here. Overall, if you have the time and money I would think 7-8 days at the Conrad makes for a great experience. 

One thing to note is that the managers reception is a TRAP. Free flowing drinks with very little canapés. It’s a trick to give you the drunchies. Be aware. Fortunately this landed on the day we had our “free three course dinner” free except for the 37 dollars spent on two bottles of Voss water. Thirsty from the alcohol and of course water with meal, what can you do? Thank goodness the food was great. Chicken and risotto, one of my favorite meals. Calamari and reef fish appetizer were very fresh. 

Lastly the seaplane was actually a cool experience. Don’t think of it as an extra transportation cost, but more of an excursion! Seeing the different properties and atolls was exhilarating. Nature. Beauty. Amazing. 

We stayed other non aspirational properties, but I would not make this review any longer because of them. 
on!

It was a hell of a honeymoon. Extravagant to say the least. Hopefully this was worth the read!

35,Trip To Japan Using American Airline Miles,12,3eiepz,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3eiepz/trip_to_japan_using_american_airline_miles/,30,1437813808.0,"So I have about 105,000 miles through American Airlines AAdvantage program. Is there any way to book it so that I can use that to get two free tickets to Japan and back? I've been looking and the dates I would have to go would be be near the first and be back by the 10th, of January. Unfortunately, it doesn't look as though there are any milesaaver days listed as being in there that I can use to get a week in Japan out of. I'm in New York, so Laguardia, JFK, or Stewart are all options for me.


I guess my question is, are there any other options? Do I have the capability of moving the miles to a different airline and having a better possibility of getting free round trip tickets for two people? Would calling American Airlines provide me with the possibility of getting a better deal? Or am I simply out of luck? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I also have 64,000 points with Hilton and 62,000 points with IHG. Not sure if that would help anything but I just noticed I could convert those to AAdvantage miles. I also have two free nights with Hyatt, but I don't think that would help at all.

I have until 9/25 to fly 12.5k EQM and spend $1500 EQD.  Earned status is good through 1/31/2021.

I fly about six times/year, either on Alaska Air with Companion Pass (I have two of them per year) or I'll use miles or a low cost carrier, like Frontier.  American Airlines has a hub near me.  If I don't fly AA organically, is the Platinum status worth a  mileage run?  

Can I use the Platinum status (as a challenger) to match to Alaska Gold or do I have to wait until I earn Platinum?

Thank you all in advance.","[""IMO - no it's not unless you fly it organically and often.\n\nThe biggest perk of platinum imo is the free MCE seat selection at purchase. That gives a lot of value to know every AA flight you take you'll have that extra legroom.

The 20 500 mile stickers will be yours to keep but you can only use them if you have at least Gold status on AA. Some report not being able to get upgrades with them but you can if you fly odd routes and/or odd times. For example, I've gotten many upgrades on non-hub elite light routes when flying on weekends or early in the day. Think airports like Kansas City, Durango Colorado, Omaha, etc. Not hubs like DFW or large airports like LAX (I was once at like #64 on the upgrade list at LAX for a LAX-DFW weekday run).

Then they'll grant the status until end of 2020.  \n\nThanks for the tips on the 500 mile stickers.

Still wouldn't go out of my way to spend money for the status though personally."", ""Haha actually I don't have a big problem with churning and merely accruing loads of miles/points. I churned pretty hard for a few years and it was great! But it pisses me off that elite status is given away when it's usually much harder to earn and the benefits are much more tangible. For example despite you never being an AA elite, you're now ahead of me on the upgrade list, you get to choose MCE seats for free at booking and I don't. You'll get your bags priority tagged. That's what pisses me off. Of course if I was your shoes I'd be like fuck yeah! But I'm not, so fuck AA lol. Also cracks me up how I'm getting downvoted. The AA lurkers must be out en masse."", ""I can upgrade to MCE using AA miles?  I didn't know that was an option.\n\nAnd thanks for the easy math, haha.

Maybe they don't realize that churners can only get the cheap flights and goodies because people like you actually fly the miles.  \n\nBut yeah, the free status everywhere for everybody has devalued a lot of programs.  Even something as lame as Priority Pass is difficult to use now.  I got it early on when I think only Amex Plat provided it as a perk.  Now, so many paid credit cards add it as a benefit (I think I have 3 Priority Pass memberships).

Spent like 5 hours today trying to understand different stopover/open jaw policies and trying to figure out different regions, and having a lot of trouble and would prefer help. If you have the best route set up for us, I am willing to give you 3 months of gold :)



**Basic details:**


Departure city is either SFO or OAK.


**3 Destinations:**

Japan, Tokyo or Kyoto (10 days)

Seoul (3 days)

Maldives 10 days (OR Bangkok/Ko Phi Phi, but Maldives is significantly more preferred)


Japan and Seoul can be flipped, but would like last destination to be Maldives (or Thailand). We prefer it to be Maldives, but if you cannot make it work, then Thailand would be the alternative.


**Dates:**


Departing July 1st from SFO or OAK.
Departing Final City (maldives or thailand) for arrival ON July 24.


**Points available:**


**Me:**

* United: 20,000 (Gold member, so wider availability of awards)
* Delta: 40,000
* American: 150,000
* SPG: 73,000
* Chase UR: 235,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* AMEX MR: 145,000  (transferable to a lot of airlines)


**Wife:**

* United: 12,000
* American: 64,000
* SPG: 40,000
* Chase UR: 28,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* CapitalOne: 15,600
* Amex MR: 103,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)


How can we make this work? Could really use some guidance. 

Ideal parameters: maximize stopover rules, saver awards ONLY preferred (but if no availability, might have to suck it up), would prefer business class for Departing flight from SFO/OAK.

**Booking The Trip**

My wife and I were invited to a friend's wedding in Bangkok this past fall - we quickly realized that if we were going to go, we had better make the most of our time there!  My primary goal was to get us there and back in international J, preferably Asia-based carriers, and to have free hotels while in the larger cities.  I managed to accomplish that with the points I had without much trouble, and it made for such an amazing time.  I knew going in that getting good value for points in smaller locations was tougher, and I paid cash wherever I didn't see our point value being realized.

For flights: I found space on Cathay in J flying from EWR to HKG direct without much trouble - searching via British Airway's site for availability, and calling into American was very simple.  Easy as pie to put it on hold as my wife and I finalized getting our vacation days approved and aligned.  

I booked the return flights about a month afterwards - in my research, the best returns from HAN seemed to be Star Alliance carriers, so I got a United Explorer card for a quick 50k United points to combine with my UR points.   I'd read so many good things about EVA, so they were my first priority. Finding the right flight on EVA was difficult, as there was nearly no availability on our dates, but I ended up getting lucky with space for 2 opening up for HAN-TPE-JFK.  My other choice was going to be Asiana, which had loads of availability on most days.

For hotels: I had more than a few stays at Hilton in the last year, which combined with the Aspire giving me Diamond status, netted me a boatload of points.  Booking the Conrad and Waldorf was simple and straight forward.  Hilton's website makes it incredibly easy, and the ""points & cash"" slider is a great feature.

For the other hotels and intra-Asia flights the points options were either not very attractive, points weren't an option, or the cash value was so low that using points would have been a waste.  Think something along the lines of 40k IHG points a night for $110 room.  Another example - a domestic flight on Thai Airways in J for two people for $200 total or 55k United miles.

In essence, we used a lot of points at the very beginning of the trip, then a large gap of no points, then lots of points at the end.

**Taking The Trip**

We took that late evening flight from EWR, which meant a 1:50am departure, landing in HKG at 5:30am.  The wife and I had a long day leading up to the flight with work and frantic packing, so right after the meal service finished I passed out for 10 hours straight, waking up with about 1.5 hours to landing.  Can't complain about a good night's rest, and we landed an hour early at 4:30.

After landing and the most casual immigration procedure I'd ever experienced (guy just looks at my passport and waves me through), we headed to The Arrival until our driver arrived.  Most people online complained about The Arrival, saying it was small and got crowded easily, but after I got solid breakfast and a shower any pre-conceived notions dripped away. Great place to start the day.

I had pre-booked a Blacklane airport transfer, which made getting into the city immensely helpful - we ended up getting our transfer to the Conrad in a Tesla Model S, which was loads of fun.  The Conrad was just beautiful.  The upgraded room with harbor views was awesome to wake up to every morning, and the executive lounge breakfast spread was enormous.  We spent 4 days/3 nights in Hong Kong, doing walking tours all over and eating until our engorged stomachs plead for mercy.  Highlights were the Peak, Cafe 103, old-school dim-sum, Seventh Son, [Bird Market and Flower Market](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bird+Market/@22.3247495,114.174486,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa0bc7e979fe4671a!8m2!3d22.3258908!4d114.1738208) at night, Temple Street night market, and loads of small wonton restaurants. Highly recommend using [Little Adventures in Hong Kong](https://www.littleadventuresinhongkong.com/) for any walking tours - wonderful way to get introduced to a new place.

Our flights to Chiang Mai were on Air Asia, which was a step down in quality from international J on Cathay, but got us from point A to point B in 2.5 hours without any fuss and for a good price.  We used Klook for our airport transfer in Chiang Mai, which was less formal than Blacklane, but still very nice to not have to worry about how you're going to get to the hotel after a flight.  We stayed on the outskirts of Chiang Mai at the Four Seasons, which was one of the most heavenly hotels I've ever been too.  Our upgraded pool villa had it's own 15-meter long infinity pool, private entrance, indoor/outdoor showers, and complete peace/seclusion away from the rest of the rooms in the hotel.  We could have sat on the back porch for hours and hours, but Chiang Mai beckoned.  

That first night, we began the tailoring process (I wasn't going to bring a suit with me!) for a couple of things at [His and Hers Tailors](https://www.google.com/maps/place/His+%26+Her+Tailors+House/@18.7760818,98.9992473,19.23z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x30da3aa7b0e9dded:0xcbb2f60be5fb644d!8m2!3d18.7762722!4d98.9991653).  Mr. Win took care of everything, and worked with our schedule to have several suits and jackets made up in a few days.  Such a great place.  Chiang Mai was a cavalcade of senses and noises, not unlike going to Mumbai or Dar es Salaam, but much much cleaner.  There was very little trash anywhere, and people here were clearly proud of their city.  Tuk-tuk drivers were friendly and helpful without being scammy, and the food was just awesome.  I ate as much street eats as I could take.  One of our days was dedicated to an Elephant Rehab center - I did a LOT of research, trying to find an actually ethical one, and [Patara Elephant Farm](https://www.pataraelephantfarm.com/) stood out.  

Our other days in Chiang Mai were a mix of massages, Wat (temple) sightseeing, streetfood, and painting hunting.  There were a lot of VERY talented painters, and we ended up finding a beautiful pond/koi scene that's now hanging in our front hall!

We had 4 days in Chiang Mai, then needed to get down to Bangkok for the wedding!  I found domestic J tickets on Thai Airways for $200 one-way on a 777-200, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it out!  Service was wonderful, the seats were comfy, and they managed to get in a full meal with separate dessert on a 1.5 hour flight.  I also got a kick out of monks ""cutting"" the line - there were a few signs posted around for this: monks get to go, out of respect, to the front of the line at check-in and security, and also board first.  We had monks on all of our Thailand and Cambodia flights.

We were picked up by another Blacklane in Bangkok, and taken to the Waldorf Astoria.  This hotel is still pretty new, and it showed.  Everything GLEAMED.  It actually hurt to stare at the hotel if you were walking up to it on a sunny day.  The rooms were high-tech; windows, lights, TV, AC, lamps, bathroom fan, etc. was controllable from an ipad next to the bed.  Was fun to wake up, hit a button, and watch the room be bathed in early morning Bangkok light.  Over the three days we were in Bangkok, we spent a good deal of time with the wedding party and the activities around that, but one whole day was dedicated to just my wife and I doing a tour.  Could not recommend [Smiling Albino Tours](https://www.smilingalbino.com/) for private tours enough.  Our guide took care of EVERYTHING for the day, made sure we weren't overheating (was 92+ degrees with like 1000% humidity), gave great history lessons/background to what we were looking at, and was funny to boot.  8 hours whizzed by in a happy blur while walking and riverboating along the canals and klongs.

After the wedding, we had a hungover, dehydrated, and verrrrryyy early flight to Siem Reap in Cambodia - home of Angkor Wat.  However, my hangover was washed away by the ride our hotel was picking us up in.  [Virtoth's Hotel](http://viroth-hotel.com/) sent (for only $30 extra) a 1960's Rolls-Royce to pick us up!  What an experience! It was about 300 feet long, and must have weighed more than all the elephants in Cambodia put together, judging by the noise the suspension made going over bumps.  I had to yell across a chasm of space to have the driver hear us. He may have been seated in a different zip code.  

The highlight, of course, when one goes to Siem Reap is the Angkor Wat temple complex.  Our guide from [Angkor Special Tours](https://angkorspecialtours.com/) on the first day took us to Angkor Wat first, in the afternoon, but from the rear entrance - he didn't want us to see it from the front until we got a chance to at sunrise the next morning.  Having a personal guide (you're probably noticing a theme here) makes all the difference, IMO, in enjoying something.  After Angkor Wat was Angkor Thom, and then about 3 more temples whose name is now escaping me.  ""Temple-itis"" is definitely real, but if you're a history buff, and your guide is willing to explain everything to you, then you'll never stop smiling.

The next morning, we did the quintessential ""sunrise at Angkor Wat"" thing, which was fun, but very crowded.  Glad I did it, but don't need to go back.  The BIG highlight for me, however, was being the first person into [Ta Prohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Prohm).  Our guide managed to get us in a few minutes early, and we had the whole temple to ourselves.  It truly is a magical, wonderful, ethereal place.  Beautiful grey silk cotton trees strangle the rock and edifices and massive roots cascade, web-like, off roofs to form walls of intricately mangled wood.  We got about 30 minutes here to ourselves and it was out of this world cool.

That evening, we flew to Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines on a 737 with about 15 people on it. Fun. It was hellish to get through immigration, and hell again finding our driver, and then hell a third time watching him text, email, call, and drive simultaneously at 100 kph.  Hanoi might have Mumbai beat for insane traffic.  I ran out of fingers and toes to count the near-death experiences.  A quick night's stay at the La Siesta Trendy, and we were picked up the next day at 7am by our driver to head to Ha Long Bay!  It's a four hour drive to Ha Long, so bring a book or stare out the window at endless rice paddies.  

I had booked us onto the [L'Amour Junk](https://www.indochina-junk.com/lamour-junk/) for one night.  This may have been the highlight of the trip for us.  We had been going at a quick pace for almost 2 weeks straight at this point (5 cities in 14 days), but hadn't realized it until we relaxed on the lounge chairs, watching limestone islets and crags slowly pass by.  Our boat was private - just the crew and us - so it enabled us to skip all of the ""touristy"" items that all the boat companies in Ha Long bring you to - we simply asked the captain if we could keep cruising instead of doing a cave tour or whatever and he said ""No problem, it's your boat"" (or something to that effect in Vietnamese).  Even at a leisurely 5kph, the grandeur of Ha Long and Bai Tu Long Bay cannot be ignored.  It feels primordial - like you've been transported back to an earlier version of yourself, millions of years ago.  Our meals on the boat were to die for - fresh seafood and local veggies, and after a bottle or two of good wine sleep came easily and quickly.  Slowly waking up on the boat on the water was a great experience, and stepping back on land was bittersweet - we wished we had more time to spend on the bay.

After getting back to Hanoi, our last day and a half was spent exploring cafes, bun cha joints, and attempting not to die while crossing the street.  The flights back to JFK from HAN were a great way to end our trip - we loved the Song Hong lounge with its enormous windows and great runway views, the Infinity Lounge in TPE had amazing showers and tasty food options, and the piece de resistance: EVA in J from TPE to JFK direct.   I'm not going to be upset about a comfy seat, Krug 2004, delicious food, and Kavalan Whisky.  Flight attendants went above and beyond - after I had finished my dinner, I grabbed my pajamas and went to the bathroom to get changed.  in the 5 minutes I was gone, my entire bed was made up for sleeping, my slippers were placed neatly, and my spare shirt was taken to be hung.  Haven't had that in any other international J product.  We actually made the mistake of sleeping *too much on the flight back - my wife and I slept about 8 hours each.  We took off at 9pm, and landed at 10pm the same day, so we in essence had a full nights' rest then landed at bedtime.  It was two weeks before I wasn't waking up at 4am everyday.

My wife and I absolutely had the best time on this trip, and I cannot emphasize enough how fun, tasty, and enjoyable SE Asia can be.

40,Planning on signing up for an airline rewards program.,3,44um2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/44um2w/planning_on_signing_up_for_an_airline_rewards/,27,1455016026.0,"Hello

I am a college student from New Jersey. Over the past few years, I have done a lot of travel. In a year alone, I had two trips to Houston and a trip to Guatemala while I was in high school. As my travels might continue to continue, I am noticing the need to sign up for a rewards program that will work around me.

My most frequently used airport is EWR. It's very close to home and fits most of my needs. My most frequently used airline however... I dunno.

Most of the time, we attempt to fly United. My father flew Continental for ages and now tries his best to fly United as they both merged.. Only once in a while will he fly another airline, usually because of the cost. I had a similar situation as some of these trips were paid for by organizations. When I was invited to Houston and Alabama for three competitions, I flew twice on Southwest to Houston and once on American to Alabama.

I also plan on moving south to Maryland which has hubs for both Southwest and United. Nonetheless, I am still unsure how good of a frequent mile program United is and if its even worth considering, however with my more recent travel, I might end up trying it out.

Any thoughts?","[""Most frequent traveller programs are free to register - why not sign up for every airline/hotel/rental car company you use?

It's crazy.\n\nDominican Republic is a must and will most certainly be on the list. I can fly JetBlue, United, or Delta. Jetblue always wins in this round as they fly direct from EWR to the Dominican Republic. United can be a bit more expensive from time to time.\n\nI might end up traveling to parts of the east coast for school related travel. The most common place I have been is Houston. I also have Orlando on my list. These are big with NASA centers. There is also DC and Baltimore (which is why I would benefit with having United since I can earn miles with Amtrak). Most of this might end up being for internships and such.\n\nThe issue is that I had my travel organized for me three times, and all of them were on different airlines. I flew to Houston on Southwest (that will change because they are ending the EWR-HOU route). I flew to Alabama on American. My travel has gone crazy.\n\nNewark is the most convenient airport for me as I live close, which is why I'd rather pick United, however their rewards program isn't at as rewarding as it was in the past.

No matter how sexy the card is. \n\nTo get those miles, you also have to spend $4k in 90 days. That can be difficult even post school. \n\n I have both the cards you are considering.

This may or may not be better in practice, because United is also the least reliable airline in America. A higher percentage of their flights are cancelled or delayed than any other airline.\n\nAlso, are you going to have control over travel arrangements, or will your school be doing that for you?"", ""- Mileage earning is based on revenue. Unless you buy the most expensive tickets and have elite status, you'll do better crediting to other programs.\n\n- Redeeming miles on airlines other than United for premium class tickets is twice as expensive. Other programs don't have this limitation; the price is the same for partner flights as for flights on the airline's own metal.\n\n- You're limited to StarAlliance.

I'd expect Southwest to have consistently lower fares, actually, for political reasons: they're trying to get DCA opened up to more flights, and one of the arguments they're making in Congress is that they bring low-fare competition. This isn't really true in most of their markets, but you can take advantage in the interim.\n\nMy pick: **Southwest** - their Rapid Rewards program will get you the most free trips to Houston vs. United. And the fares are lower. If you would like a double bonus link for the Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card (50k points vs. the 25k public offer), PM me your email and I'll send it.\n\nUnfortunately, Southwest doesn't help you to Newark. Nobody does except for United. If you're willing to fly to other New York area airports, more options open up. They're not cheap either, though.\n\nPrice is the real problem. Flights in the DC to New York corridor tend to be very expensive; you can actually fly cross-country for the same price. And you don't save a lot of time either. Flights are frequently delayed in this very congested corridor, plus you have to get to the airport and clear security. So I looked at another option that takes only a little longer when you factor in the entire journey: **Megabus**. For about $25 each way (and sometimes as low as $10), you can travel in a new luxury coach with WiFi the whole way. A roundtrip costs 1/5 as much as flying and you don't have to hassle with airports and the TSA. Obviously, as a student, your time isn't worth $200 an hour, which is about what you'll be saving. :)"", '""Major US carriers"" is the operative word. If you fly United, you can actually do better--unless you\'re a very top elite flyer buying the most expensive tickets--crediting your flights to Copa or Aegean. \n\nIt\'s true that United has more routes and destinations than Alaska. However, they certainly don\'t within the Pacific Northwest or along the West Coast. Or, in particular, within Alaska--which is in play per the OP. Alaska is the undisputed king here. Not even Delta measures up.\n\nHowever, if you are an Alaska flyer, or using Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan, your reach isn\'t limited to *just* Alaska. You also have access to Delta and American\'s flights and their saver award inventory as well. So then it becomes a calculation of all of them versus United. If overseas itineraries are in play, add Air France, KLM, British Airways, Icelandair, Hainan, Emirates, Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, LAN, Qantas and Aeromexico to the mix. And Fiji Airways. Yes, *Fiji Airways*.  \n\nSure, in a few circumstances, United still comes out on top. I need a nonstop on a very specific schedule from Dulles to LAX nonstop over Memorial Day weekend, and United is essentially my only option. They win on nonstop routes to their well-defended fortress hubs. However, for the most part, United is rarely the only real option and given their lack of reliability, they\'re rarely also the best option. I use them rarely and credit the miles to my Aegean account. Sooner or later, there will be enough there to redeem for an intra-Europe ticket to Zagreb, a hard-to-reach destination without Croatia Airlines in play.\n\nI didn\'t call United the worst frequent flier program in America. That honor goes to Spirit, closely followed by Delta. Both are truly awful. However, they are definitely among the worst. American (even post devaluation and after switching to a revenue-based program) and Alaska are both superior, and Alaska wins hands down. There\'s just no contest in the Great Northwest.', ""Oh yeah, i've looked into it and it's all great advice. Most likely I will look into getting another card in the near future once I have more  income."", ""I've been told Capital One can't do that, which sucks."", ""Mhmm.\n\nRight now, I am stuck between the two. I might sign up for both, as I am planning on getting the Chase Sapphire Preferred which works with both SWA and United. For the time being, It's going to be United until I work something out. I love Southwest <3\n\nI felt that Southwest would be far superior once I move out to DC. As a student, I am stuck with United as they are the only ones that do well in Newark. I might end up flying Delta or JetBlue once in a while, but United is my only choice.\n\nI remember seeing a roundtrip ticket from EWR-IAH cost $1200 for a half empty flight once, yet it was $300 from EWR-HOU on Southwest :|\n\nAs for the Newark-DC trip, I usually take the bus anyway. Otherwise, I do have family that travel by car and I ride along with them. Not a huge problem."", ""well I guess like most things in this game it's all about what you need it for and what's worth it to an individual flyer.    "", ""Ah, the Sapphire Preferred. I just wrote an article on why it's not always the best card: http://www.seat31b.com/2016/02/why-you-shouldnt-get-the-chase-sapphire-preferred/ \n\nIn your case it's not a bad card to have, but I recommend getting the Southwest card too (if you do, use my link). You'll probably end up flying Southwest a lot from DCA to take advantage of the cheaper fares, and this gives you a lot of opportunities to redeem points. No reason not to go for both cards; apply for them both at once.\n\nIt gets really tricky when you want to book award flights, because the airline with the most convenient schedule often has the least amount of availability. That's because everyone in Atlanta is flying Delta, and everyone in Dulles is flying United, so when you want to use your points, you have a lot of competition. So you use your Delta points flying from Dulles and your United points in Charlotte. This isn't universally true but you have to get creative and look off the beaten path when booking award flights.\n\n"", ""Of course. Right now, however, I am in a place where SWA doesn't fly often. I think I might end up flying more on SWA in the next few years and I might end up taking the stops instead of flying direct with United.\n\nI already know how bad it is to use miles/points since my father has flown on some flights with just points, so yeah.""]"

She travels a lot for work and I try to get her to use one world whenever possible, but sometimes she will pick Southwest or Delta just because it is more convenient. That's fine. It's her life. But right now we are looking at summer vacation tickets to Europe. The one world Alliance tickets are extremely expensive at the moment. Perhaps they will drop, especially since the euro is doing poorly against the dollar, and of course the airlines are raking in record profits, but on the other hand they may not drop the prices if they can sell them for these exorbitant prices.

There are some other airlines which are a few hundred dollars cheaper to our destination, such as Icelandair and the Portuguese airline TAP. But they have some drawbacks in terms of the itinerary , and also we would be losing quite a few miles. Now the important thing about having miles for me is keeping my status, because I like having the free main cabin extra seats , as well as boarding first and all that other crap. I rarely used my miles for award tickets, although we have and it has saved us a lot of money. So I'm wondering whether should pay perhaps 200 or $300 more per ticket to fly with one world then with one of these non Alliance Airlines, like Delta or Swissair.

42,Going to be doing a lot of NYC to Washington DC travel and looking to maximize points/gain status,12,abq1lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/abq1lc/going_to_be_doing_a_lot_of_nyc_to_washington_dc/,26,1546433634.0,"I'm going to be going back and forth from NYC to DC relatively frequently (maybe 4-6 flights a month? Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

I am having an extremely tough time finding availability in business class for flights to Europe this summer that avoid BA & the surcharge in taxes/fees. We are looking to fly into any of the following cities:

* Dublin
* Amsterdam
* Barcelona
* Paris
* Munich

I am looking at dates from May 20 through the end of August and cannot find ANYTHING. Is availability really this poor? Any insight or tips on how to find these flights is helpful.

44,Help Filing a Complaint with AA,0,9s57ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9s57ix/help_filing_a_complaint_with_aa/,24,1540778477.0,"A few hours ago, my wife and I had planned on flying AA from LGA to CHO with tickets that we redeemed using Citi points. When we arrived at the airport, we checked in via the kiosk, printed out our boarding passes (I also had my boarding pass on my American Airlines app). Long story short, we got to our gate approximately 15 minutes early, only to find out that the plane changed gates. Since the terminal was too far away, it caused us to miss our flight, so we had to rebook our flight through Charlotte.  There was no announcement telling us that there was a gate change and neither my wife nor I received any email or text message notifications.  

We’re now on course to arrive 6 hours late, which is pretty frustrating because we’re missing some family events. I’d have to believe that American won’t take any responsibility but I’m wondering if it’s worth my time to explain my disappointment and frustration to maybe get some miles back?  Has anyone had success doing this? If so, what is the most effective way of voicing a complaint?","[""It sounds like you arrived at the airport too late. Even if there wasn't a gate change, you likely would have arrived to a closed door if you didn't reach the gate until 15 minutes prior to departure - most airlines start boarding 30-45 minutes prior. Plan to arrive at the airport at *least* 1.5 hours prior to the scheduled departure time in the future."", ""I thought AA only flies out of terminal B at LGA? 15min prior to departure is the last call boarding time. You left zero margin for error.\n\nDid you check the boards/app for the gate # ~30min before the flight? Does the kiosk printed boarding pass have the wrong gate # on it? If AA gave you bad gate info in multiple ways you might get a very small compensation, but if not I wouldn't even bother contacting customer care."", ""I mean it's not going to hurt you to send in an email/complaint but to be honest this is 100% on you. \n\nAll tickets/apps/announcements have a disclaimer that gates may change and you need to double check on the boards in the airport. Clearly other people were able to notice the change and plan accordingly. I understand it sucks you missed a flight, but you apparently got rebooked without charge. That's the airline already being generous as they could've legally told you tough cookies."", 'This is why I ALWAYS check the screens when I get to the airport. I learnt this after almost missing a flight for which I got no txt/email/app announcement of a gate change.', ""You realize you can literally look up after passing through security to check the assigned gates, right? There's the separate issue of gates actually closing 15 min before departure but if you had cut it that close then whatever number you would have seen on those screens would've told you what the new gate was.\n\nThe screens are there for this very reason.\n\nYou also might've gotten to the right gate but saw it closed with the plane getting ready to taxi if you cut it that close. Imagine what would have happened if the new gate took like 5 more min to get to than the old one from security."", 'Yeah I agree with the others. AA went above and beyond by rebooking you for free. You should arrive on time next time', ""Honestly, be happy you got tickets because of flat tire rule/you were there. \n\nI've dealt with airports where I had to check in, at the airport, not online in SEA, and the cutoff is 90mins+ and due to long lines and crappy computers, get cut off one min and have to go to a different ticket counter where I have to pay a change fee + additional fee to get a new ticket. \n\n15 mins early is barely enough time to catch a plane imo, and, google w/ your flight number will say the correct gate, usually. \n\nThat's it. \n\n"", ""Did you arrive at the original gate 15 minutes before the stated departure time or 15 minutes before stated boarding time? I'm assuming departure time, which is cutting it really close. The way you wrote the post makes me think this wasn't your plan, but I hope you make sure to show up earlier than that next time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid AA charge you to rebook the flight? Assume no checked bags, but if so, did they get lost? Depending on your status, your history with AA, your booked fare class, among other things, you may get some compensation in the form of miles if you send a complaint. In your complaint letter, stay specific and stick to the core issue - arriving late due to poor communication from AA regarding a change of gate. If you don't hear back within \\~5 business days, reach out on Twitter. As I said, you will unlikely get anything more than a few thousand miles. Make sure to be clear you are complaining for the both of you, and include both AAdvantage numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWas this flight part of a round trip ticket? Have you confirmed the return flight hasn't been cancelled because you no-showed the first leg, even though it was rebooked I don't trust the AA agent to have done that correctly. "", 'I\'m with the others that you should have arrived earlier.  But it\'s also disappointing that you didn\'t receive an e-mail/text alerting you of the gate change if you were signed up for notifications.  I\'ve found sending a direct message on Twitter can be effective.  I never write ""you"", but rather name the company\'s name when I send the message since I think it helps to differentiate between the company and the person working the Twitter account.  If you have any screenshots - like your original boarding pass showing the gate assignment and a screenshot of the current flight tracker showing a different actual gate - send those along as they could help your case.  Hopefully the rest of your trip will go smoothly!', 'yeah, i remember when i literally got to a gate 15 min before and they closed it as I ran up there. feelsbadman', 'This annoys me to no end. The gate closes 10 minutes before departure. They should adhere to that instead of randomly closing the door whenever they feel like it. ', 'The 15 minutes was just a ballpark number. I’ve never missed a flight before, so I don’t think that this was the core issue. ', 'They have two concourses in Terminal B, so it’s a decent hike possibly. ', ""They didn't close it early. They arrived at the wrong gate and didn't make it to the right one in time."", 'iirc most gates close 15 min before scheduled departure.', 'It sure is a frustrating way to start your trip. The reason they tell you to arrive early and to be at the gate when boarding starts is so that if there are issues like this you have time to deal with them. It is not SOP to announce gate changes and often when booked via a OTA (like Citi), you do not get notices. Some airlines like BA in cases like this would just cancel your ticket and you would need to purchase a new one, it looks like AA applied the “flat tire rule” and you got your flight changed for free which they are not obligated to do. I would not complain ', ""I greatly sympathize with you on this. Missing a flight sucks. However, the lesson to learn here is that there are numerous apps and sites out there that will track your upcoming flights (for free!) and give you a push alert if something changes.

45,FAQ: US - Japan,30,3ekcq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3ekcq3/faq_us_japan/,24,1437865999.0,"As I put the finishing touches on my April 2016 LAX - Japan trip, I decided to write a little something something to help others and myself place this popular award travel dream into perspective. The following will set clear some questions that come up a lot both on this subreddit and /r/churning. By no means am I an avid award traveler. This is mostly from my research/FME. No loyalty to an airliner is regarded.

These are some Frequently Asked Questions regarding award travel to Japan from the US. These start very basic and then get a bit more complicated.



**1.) What is the most efficient way to get to Japan from the US via award travel?**

Definitely American Airlines AAdvantage Miles. 

One-way award seats at 25k (off-peak),50k, 62.5k miles for econ, business, first are difficulty to beat. Especially when the competition usually charges high fees. Plus, you earn 10% back on points if you have an AA Aviator Red, Aviator Silver, Platinum Select, Executive credit card open.



**2.) Where are all the US - Japan award flights on AA.com? They are not showing up!**

Many (all?) partner flights do not even show up AA.com. Search on British Airway's (start here), Qantas', or Japan Airlines' award reservation system. Note the flight #. Call AA's reservation line @ 1-800-882-8880. Make sure to tell them the flight is not visible on aa.com, but you know for a fact it exist and is available. The CS rep. should waive the phone booking fee because of this comment.



**3.) I still do not see award flights on the BA/Qantas/JAL award reservation system. How can I get the flight I want?**

Well they obviously exist. Please note that availability is quite low, especially for the business and first class seats. You may have to book close to 11 months in advance to be sure you get the ticket on the dates you want.

Some have had luck booking flights weeks/days before departure. Sometimes additional reward seats are released close to departure. Huge YMMV here. So good luck.



**4.) I do not have enough AA miles and cannot churn to the needed AA miles (for X reason). I got loads of United and Delta points though. What are some of my options?**

United will charge 70k miles for a round-trip award ticket. [Further breakdown regarding partners and ticket type here.](http://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx) Expect much higher fees with United compared to AA. United's reservation system will show most all partnered award flights.

Sorry IDK shit about Delta :D. All I know is its possible. Delta's reservation system will show a decent amount of partnered award flights, and Delta miles are not as efficient as the competition.



**5.) I want to see much of Japan. How much are Japan Domestic flights?**

British Airways will charge 4,500 miles plus a $2 fee for one-way JAL domestic flights. You can travel between major cities via The Bullet Train...



**6.) I want to see much of Japan. Is The Bullet Train worth using when on budget compared to British Airways short haul flights? What is the JR pass and what are its key limitation? How can I get it for free?**

Yes, the Bullet Train (Shinkansen) is worth it if you get the JR pass. The passes start at 29,110 Yen (currently this is $234.02 on 21/7/2015) for the seven day option. 

The JR pass key limitation that we care about is the fact that it can only be bought when outside of Japan and can only be bought my tourists. There are many rules and limitations, but it is still worth. I've read that the Green JR Pass is not worth for the typical tourist.

[Please read through all the rules here.](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/) There are many ways to use the pass and it would be unfortunate to realize a specific thing you wanted to use it for is not allowed.

You can get it for free by redeeming points/""miles"" against the charge. Like on the Arrival +, Cap1 Venture, or other credit cards of the like. Sign-up bonuses for these cards are higher than the cost of the JR pass.

*The JR Pass will code as Tourist Attaction on the Arrival +. You will have to call to get the charge erased with your points. We don't know how the recent changes to the Arrival + effected this option.



**7.) What about award stays at hotels? Any recommendations?**

Redeeming the two free nights [from this Chase sign-up bonus](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/hyatt-card.aspx) at the Park Hyatt Tokyo is a very popular option around here. Book ahead since availability is killer.

The SPG Sheraton in Osaka is an extremely cheap points option @4k points a night.

Cannot go wrong with AirBnB. Japanese hospitality is highly regarded. The host may really help you out here. Statement credit points/miles can be used to cover AirBnB charges.



**8.) What sort of awards can I redeem if I want to fly Singapore Airlines? Should I redeem through United or Singapore if I have the option?**

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles can be redeemed at 32.5k, 77.5k, and 87.5k miles for econ, business, and first class/suites respectfully when flying from West Coast US. [Go here to look at their full award chart.](http://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQMI_OneWayAwardCharts.pdf) Now take into account the 15% miles discount if you book online and Singapore Airlines' legendary service quality. You are getting great value for these options.

Amex MR, Chase UR, Citi TY points, and SPG points can all be transferred to Singapore KrisFlyer miles. So you have a lot of easy churning strategies.

Note that some Singapore Air econ and business tickets are on sale right now (as of 21/07/2015) and may not be worth booking econ with miles. It will always be very worth it to redeem miles for Singapore Business/First Class/Suite award seats.

Also, keep it mind that Singapore Air charges above average fees for award tickets. We talking slightly over $100 for SFO/LAX - HND/NRT business; still worth though.

United will charge less for the econ seat, both in points and fees. Unfortunately, United charges more points for business and first class/suite. Also, United has less availible award seats than their partners on a per partner flight bases. If you don't see an business/first class award seat on United, it may still be open on Singapore.



**9.) What other great business and first class award seats are available?**

The Points Guy talks highly about the JAL First class experience. Plus, its only 62.5k AA miles for one-way award seat. Avalibility is extremely low so book well in advanced. Do a little research on the service and you'll fall in love.



**10.) What are you going to do in Japan?**

- Part 2: [How to book an award trip to Asia using AA Miles](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4old0h/how_to_book_an_award_trip_to_asia_using_aa_miles/)

This is a guide on how to use American Airlines AAdvantage miles to book an award trip to Asia.  I'm going to be going over the mechanics of the search and booking process.  I'll let the reader decide whether a particular award is a Good Value.

Note, many airlines open up award seats 330 days out.  But the fact is that award availability is always changing.  I've seen Cathay open up seats 330 days out.  I've seen Japan Airlines and AA open seats 6 months out.  There are other tools dedicated to finding availability, but I'm only going to talk about easily accessible and free search mechanisms.

## How Many AA Miles to Asia?

The first place to go to is the AA award charts.  There are two actual charts, one that applies to only to [AA operated flights](https://www.aa.com/i18n/AAdvantage/redeemMiles/american-airlines-award-chart2016.jsp), and the second chart applies to [AA partners, such as CX and JL](https://www.aa.com/i18n/AAdvantage/redeemMiles/all-partner-chart2016.jsp).  

AA divide Asia into two regions:

- Asia 1: Japan, Korea
- Asia 2: China, Hong Kong, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Saipan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam

The following data was extracted from the Award Charts.  Before you book a trip, make sure you check the award chart and make sure the numbers haven't changed.  All numbers listed are for one way travel.

North America to Asia 1 on AA Flights:

- Economy Off Peak: 32,500  
- Economy : 35,000
- Business : 62,500
- First: 80,000

North America to Asia 2 on AA Flights:

- Economy Off Peak: 32,500  
- Economy : 35,000
- Business : 65,000
- First : 85,000

North America to Asia 1 on Partner Flights:

- Economy : 35,000
- Business : 60,000
- First: 80,000

North America to Asia 2 on Partner Flights:

- Economy : 37,500
- Business : 70,000
- First : 110,000

North America to Indian Subcontinent on CX and AA Only:

- Economy : 40,000
- Business : 70,000
- First : 115,000


## AA Award Rules

A couple of rules to take note of.  AA does not allow Stopovers en-route.  This means that if you are taking a flight SFO-HKG-DPS, you can't stop in HKG for more than 24 hours.  Your HKG-DPS flight must be within 24 hours of the previous flight landing in HKG.  If you want to stop and visit HKG for a few days, you would have to book 2 awards, SFO-HKG, then a HKG-DPS flight.

Another rule that comes into play, is the Region transit rule.  AA does not allow you to fly to Asia 1 with a transfer in Asia 2.  However, it does allow a transfer to Asia 2 through Asia 1.  So SFO-HKG-HND is not allowed, but SFO-HND-HKG is allowed.

AA now allows flying into the Indian Subcontinent using Cathay and AA flights, via Hong Kong.  If you want to use any other partner, the flight has to be trans-atlantic.

##How to search Award on AA flights

This is the most straight forward, but limits you to AA operated flights.  Here are the steps to search for an award for SFO-PEK:

- Go to AA.com
- Check the ""Redeem Miles"" box
- Enter SFO and PEK as the source/destination
- Select some dates, say March 1st through March 9th, 2016
- Search
- You will see a weekly calendar display, with Green, Blue, and Purple legends on top.  Select ""Show Full Calendar"".
- The color legends on top indicates whether there are awards at that level.  We really only care about AA calls MileSAAver awards.  Their AAnytime awards have a lot more availability, but at a much higher cost in terms of miles (more than double).  Select the Light Green Economy MileSAAver.
- You will now see a number of dates grayed out, but also a number of days that is light green, with ""35k"" labels.  Those indicate dates where there are Saver awards for 35k.
- Pick an Outbound Date and Inbound date for your trip.  Ideally both with 35K awards.  Hit continue.
- AA will now show you the list of flights available with 35K award seats.  As you can see, the routing is tortured.  For example the first one I picked shows:  SFO-CLT-ORD-PEK.  So to get from San Francisco to Beijing, AA will first fly you to Charlotte, then to Chicago, then Beijing.

If you followed along, you now know how to find an AA award.  You also see an example why you might want to fly a partner flight, as AA is obviously limited by their own schedule, and in Asia Region 2, AA will only fly to China and Hong Kong.  If you want to go to Bali, AA isn't going to get you there.  If you try a SFO-DPS search, you will find no AA flights.

Booking these awards are pretty easy.  Since you are using the AA website, double check and make sure the flights are there, the AA miles it will cost you is accurate, and just book the flights.

## How to search Award on OneWorld Partner flights

This is where it gets fun.  We get questions all the time about how airline partnership and alliances work.  In this case, we will be showing you how to find OneWorld Flights, and book them using **AA miles**.

We are limited by the fact that AA.com does not show all Partner awards, and in the case of Asia, we need to see award seats on CX and JL.  So we are going to use BA.com, which does show awards for all these airlines.  You can also use Qantas.com or JAL.com.

There are a couple of issues using BA.com for search that you need to be aware of. BA tries to find you the flight from source to destination, but it is a hit and miss, and it can also show phantom availability.  For example, if you are looking for a 1st class flight, BA will show it as available even when only the shortest segment has 1st class seats available.

To work around the search limitation, do a segment by segment search.  So for example, if I want to go from SFO-DPS, I know I can search for HKG-DPS, then SFO-HKG.  If I can find award seats on both of those segments, I can then book it as a single award.  To make it even simpler, search for one way trips.

- Go to BA.com
- Register as an Executive Club member for free. If you don't register, you can't do award search.
- Login as a BA Executive Club Member
- Select Executive Club-Spending Avios-Book a reward flight
- Enter source/destination/date, and search for HKG-DPS on March 1st, 2016
- The result shows me that CX785, March 1st 10:05-14:55, has economy award seats available.  I write this down.  Now I need to get to HKG before this time.
- I now search for SFO-HKG on Feb 28th (Remember the International Date line!)
- The result shows me that CX879, 11:55-18:55, has economy award seats available!  This means I need to spend the night in Hong Kong since the flight arrives in Hong Kong on the 29th, but still valid in terms of routing because it's less than 24 hours in Hong Kong.
- Now, I do the same to search for the return flights.  If I'm lucky, I find the award availability, and I write down all the information.

By playing with the BA search tool, you can try different routes, such as SFO-TYO-DPS, or even SFO-PEK/PVG-DPS.  These different routes will put you on different airlines, with different flight availability.

## Call AA to Book a flight
Now that you know the exact flights you want, it is time to book these flights.  First of all, you will be paying via AA miles, so any award cost shown on BA.com during your search is NOT applicable.  If your trip is only in Economy, and awards are available, you should be paying 75K AA miles for the round trip, plus tax and fees.

AA does have a close-in booking fee of $75, which can be avoided if you hold AA elite status.  This will apply if you are booking to travel within the next 21 days.  Easy way to avoid this is just book more than 21 days before travel.  AA also have a phone booking fee, but it should not apply as the award you are booking is not bookable online.  If the agent tries to charge you for this, gently remind the agent.

Before your call AA to book this ticket, make sure you have your AAdvantage number, your AA miles balance, your entire itinerary including date, flight number and schedule, the traveler's exact name on their passport, and their birth date.  Don't guess what the name should be, as a mistake here can cost you $150 to cancel and reticket the flight.  Also, decide whether you want to put the award on a 5 day hold, or ticketed directly.  A 5 day hold is very useful if you have other bookings you need to make before you finalize the trip.  Have a pen and paper ready as well.

To book this trip, call the AA International AAdvantage desk at (800)882-8880.  Might as well put this on speed dial, as you will likely need to call them at least one more time.  Once you navigate the kind of painful menu tree on the phone, you will reach an agent.  Let the agent know:

- You would like to book an award ticket on a partner flight, and that you know the exact flights you want
- The date of travel
- From City, Transfer city, and Destination City
- When the agent asks, provide the segment by segment information.
- Class of Service:  Economy/Business/First

The agent will try to find the flights you found on their computer.  After a bunch of pounding on their keyboard, the optimal result would be the agent finding the flights, and telling you the cost in Miles and Taxes/Fees.  For a trip to Hong Kong on CX, you should be looking at about $75 in Fees and taxes.  This amount will differ based on your destination.

Double check the dates, mileage cost, and Fees/Taxes.  If everything sounds correct, ask the agent to book or hold the ticket.  If you are booking the ticket, the agent will ask for your AAdvantage number, and ask for a credit card to charge the fees.

Once the ticket is booked, the agent will give you a Passenger Record Locator number, commonly referred to as a PNR.  You should write this down as if you need to refer to this reservation again.  You should also ask for the PNR for the partner airline, such as JL or CX.  The partner PNR is useful if you want to contact the partner airline, such as going to the CX website and select your seat.

## What if AA can't find the award seat?

Ideally, IT systems are fully in sync, and BA/AA computers agrees with each other.  Sadly, this is not the case.  Many people have complained that they see an award on BA.com, but it does not show up on AA agent's computer, OR VICE VERSA.  So during your call, it is very possible that the agent does not find the segments your worked hard to piece together.  Or the agent may even find you a better routing.

Sometime, the agent will just do more digging, and find the seats eventually.  But, the seats may also just not be there for any variety of reasons.  The answer?  Hang Up and Call Again.  If on a second call, the agent still does not see the seats, but your BA.com searches still shows those as available, you may just want to wait 8-12 hours, and try the call again.  It is possible that BA.com is the one in the wrong here.  Just last week, BA.com showed me some phantom availability, and sure enough, they disappeared within a few minutes.

## Ticket On Request
You now have the PNR, you paid the fees, you log into AA.com after 5 days, and you see the ticket in the status ""On Request"".  This means the ticketing process is not yet done.  AA has a manual review process for award tickets, and On Request means the process is still on-going.  

The ticket may be far out enough that AA haven't gotten to it, or that it is stuck for some reason.  If your travel date is coming up soon, time to call AA again.  Even if your travel date is far in the future, call after 5 days just to make sure they are not waiting on you for some information.  Once the ticketing process is done, the ticket should show the status ""Ticketed"".  You aren't quite done yet.

## Monitoring your ticket

It is important to check on your ticket every few weeks or so.  Airlines may change their schedule or airplane, and a carefully planned itinerary may suddenly have a 20 minute transfer time, which doesn't work anymore.  Ideally, AA email/call you and work with you, but this doesn't always happen.  So log into AA.com periodically, and check up on your PNR.  If anything looks different, call AA and sort it out.

## AA Award Ticket FAQs

AA One World award tickets have a very unique advantage.  AA will allow you to change your travel date, route, and even airline for free, provided that you do it before the travel date, and that the source and destination cities remain the same.  The date you change to must have award availability on all segments, and the new travel date must not be more than 1 year from the original booking date.  Also, if you try to change the date to within 21 days of the original booking date to try to avoid the $75 close in ticketing fee, AA will now want to charge you the $75 fee.

Another perk of the AA Award ticket, is that if you want to upgrade your class of service, there are no additional fees other than the extra miles.  So upgrading from a Economy ticket to Business will only require the additional miles, and the availability of the business class award seat.

If you need to cancel or change the source/destination cities, AA will charge you $150 per ticket.

48,A Guide to Asia Miles (Cathay Pacific),33,478tp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/478tp5/a_guide_to_asia_miles_cathay_pacific/,23,1456290883.0,"Hello /r/awardtravel,


I'm writing this little guide to Asia Miles simply because, IMO, a decent enough one does not exist anywhere on the web!


I went through hell trying to figure this FF program out the past 3 months and I wanted to share my knowledge so people don't make the same mistakes I did. 


Also for people to understand there is another decent FF program out there that can fly them almost anywhere in the world and at (sometimes) competitive award prices.
The following information includes over 15 calls to Asia Miles, at least 20 hours of hold time, a few months of reading, making many posts on this subreddit(see [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3uoxnx/laxberzag_using_qantas_miles/),[here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/40db5e/mr_and_spg_transfer_to_asia_miles_question/), and [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/42pn5h/asia_miles_cannot_see_aer_lingus_flight_even/) and flyertalk, and over 60 hours of research(mostly trial and error…so much error).


&nbsp;


**Why you should care (pros):**

&nbsp;

* Amex MR, SPG, and Citi TYP are all transfer partners


* Asia Miles partners with many carriers. Here is the most current list: Aer Lingus, Air Berlin, Air China, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Bangkok Airways, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern, DragonAir, Finnair, Gulf Air, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, LAN, Malaysia, Qantas, Qatar, Royal Brunei, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Sri Lankan Airlines, TAM, and US Airways


* You can make a maximum of five stopovers, two transfers and two open-jaws at either origin, en-route or turnaround point (This excludes Iberia and Air China). This means you can get crazy good redemptions with your miles given availability and you do your homework.


* You can mix up to THREE carriers in one redemption when you fly one of your legs with Cathay Pacific or DragonAir. You can mix up to TWO different carriers in a single redemption when you fly all other partners.

&nbsp;

**Why you shouldn’t care (cons):**

&nbsp;

* Terrible customer service and hold times. You have to hold their hand the entire way and then call back every day to follow-up. Don’t ever expect them to get it right the first time. They never once did for me.


* Miles required for some routes are not worth it to many (This is a distance based award system).


* Just because you see a partner on the list that you like doesn’t mean Asia Miles will allow booking on that partner. More on this below.

&nbsp;

*Everything I state going forward is recommended to be done in the order listed. This is important in getting a successful booking and it will make sense towards the end*


&nbsp;


**[Award Charts and Conditions](https://www.asiamiles.com/am/en/redeem/charts#2)**

&nbsp;

CX and KA are on the top chart. 

OneWorld is towards the bottom.


&nbsp;


**Before you transfer, check your route!**

&nbsp;

On Asia Miles website:

* click on **Redeem**


* click on **Flight Award Finder**


* Login


* Enter your Ticket-type(usually round-trip or one-way), destination and departing airports. 


* Then review your airline options. These are the partners you will be able to book with. If they do not show up, they DO NOT fly that route. So even if you know that airline usually flies that route and with award seats on different alliances or their own, it does not mean they open it up to Asia Miles for booking.


* Then click **calculate.** This will be your total cost. As far as I know, it’s been accurate.


&nbsp;


**Searching for award availability**

&nbsp;

*This is where I may need data points.* 



I did my flight for Europe, so I am very familiar with those partners:


Partner| How to find Award Availability 
---------|----------
Aer Lingus | Expert Flyer(flights found on QF or BA will not show up on their systems)
Air Berlin | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
American Airlines | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
Iberia | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
British Airways | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
Qantas | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
DragonAir| Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
Qatar | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
Finnair | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online


&nbsp;


**Transferring points over?**

&nbsp;

*Time Frames and Name Restrictions*

&nbsp;

Membership Rewards | ThankYou Points | SPG
---------|----------|----------
3 – 5 Business Days | 24 – 48 Hours | 4 – 5 Days
Name Restriction Relaxed*| Name Restriction Relaxed* | Name Restriction Strict*

&nbsp;


\*Relaxed means you **may** be able to get away with middle names/initials or entirely different names given you enter the correct membership number. Strict means that you have your name matching between the loyalty program and Asia Miles exactly. Otherwise your points/miles may go missing for up to a month.




*Protip: Have all your programs match your passport. Asia Miles will not issue you your ticket unless it matches. If they have to make a change, they will ask for you to send in a picture of your passport. And IME, that may delay your booking for another week*


&nbsp;


**Booking your flight**

&nbsp;

For all partners except for the ones listed below, which can be booked on their website, will require you to call in (unfortunately for you):

* Cathay Pacific


* Dragonair


* British Airways


* Qantas Airways


* Qatar Airways


* Finnair

&nbsp;

Also, if you are trying to do open jaw or stopovers in your flight you will also have to call since their website doesn't allow input for this type of itinerary. 


If you’re in the United States the number to call is 1-866-892-2598 and press 1,1,enter your membership id and #, 0, then 1 or 2(1-yes to customer survey, 2-no). 


The best time to call is after 9pm PST or before 8am PST. It is a 24-hour service line, but if you call outside of my recommended times, prepare to be on hold for up to 3 hours as well as facing random disconnects after an hour or so or a voicemail. 


Surprise, they never listen to their voicemail and they most definitely won’t return your call if you leave your number.


Guide them to the flight you want and hopefully they can see the availability you do. Ask them to reserve the seat. On every partner I called in about, I was able to reserve seats for at least 2-4 days. This may not be true with every partner. This is when you reserve the seat then transfer your points over. 


Of course this is never a guarantee that your seats will not all of a sudden disappear. But I haven’t seen any data points with any carrier where someone reserves seats with a partner and then they lose the seat when they call to complete the booking, but of course, if you have any data points, please reply below. Also *make sure you have your ducks in a row on the transfers as far as name matching goes!*


&nbsp;


**Fees**

&nbsp;

Fees for OneWorld alliance partners will be similar to what you see on BA’s website.


For Cathay Pacific, you are likely looking at the following fees:


* Fees and taxes imposed by government, other authority, or by the operator of an airport are HKD50.00 or more, and additional carrier-imposed charges, surcharges or fees of HKD193.00 or more will apply. The actual required miles and government and airport taxes/fees plus all carrier-imposed surcharges for all passengers will be advised at the time of booking.


More data points needed.


&nbsp;


**Upgradability**


&nbsp;


You may upgrade your seat from economy to business class, given only that there is no premium economy available on that flight. Upgrades on most partners will cost 10,000 Asia Miles or $100 for them to re-issue your ticket. This does not apply to Cathay Pacific, British Airways, and DragonAir as their policy statement posted on the award chart link states upgrades available at no extra cost.

&nbsp;

**Refunds**

If you would like to cancel a booking and get your miles refunded back, you may do so. But it will cost you $120/ticket. (HT: /u/highlander311)

If anyone has any input or data points, please post it! Especially for the sections that state ‘more data points needed.’ I will edit and add to post.


Thanks!

Thank you so much for the guide, really appreciate it!\n\nI spoke to AsiaMile agents twice: the first time to make sure I was doing this correctly, and the second time to actually book the flights. Both calls were made about 11:00pm PST and there was no wait.

Thanks for posting it!', ""Great write up! Currently sitting on hold with Asia Miles now, so this is near and dear to my heart.

You should sell this post to one of the bloggers, a few will pay for OC.

Along with allowing two transfers on their partners who are pretty decent. I've played with itineraries that can easily range $15-30k retail only using 120-220k miles."", ""I would say hopping from place to place would be a good redemption because they allow 5 stop overs on RT and one on One Way redemptions. Addionally, it allows you to get the times you'd like.\n\nAdditionally, yes, interasia flights are SUPER cheap, but Dragon/CX/Bangkok Air have a pretty good stranglehold (pretty sure Bangkok Air OWNS USM) on some routes and some times. For example, flights from CNX to HKG are over $1k on Dragonair. \n\n For example, bangkok airways has a monopoly on direct flights \n\nI'm doing BKK - USM - CNX. This would cost $306 out of pocket or 15k miles for a value of 2 cents/mile. \n\nAmazing redemption? No, but I consider 2cpp pretty decent. \n\n\nBe advised, though, that it is mileage based and the redemptions can be shitty. The example I'm doing now, because I didn't do my research, is I used 40k Asia Miles on a flight from HKG to HND in Economy. Out of pocket cost is 1,300 for 2 people, so not a bad 3cpp. That same flight on BA is only 20k miles (25k MR). I done fucked up. For 40k BA (50k MR +$30) I can have business class on that same JAL flight. \n\nHoping I can get my miles back. Even worth paying the $100 for them. "", 'For Europe, your best redemption will be on Air Lingus, Air Berlin, or a combination of them both. Hubs in Dublin and Dusseldorf.\n\nFor Asia your best redemption value is with Cathay Pacific. Using HKG as a hub, you can go all over on first or business class. You can mix with Dragon Air, Sri Lankan, Royal Jordanian, JAL, and ever Qatar Airways all for low fees.', ""This is a great redemption and exactly what I was hoping someone would do after writing this guide! It's a very good data point about the fees being higher. Usually it has to do with a particular airline or airport since I have been able to book some one world seats in J for under $100 USD. But my most recent trip was $800 for J as well which is the same price shown on BA's website when I did a dummy booking. \n\nEnjoy your trip! "", ""Update us with what you find out.

Are you asking about upgrading from economy to business with miles? I would assume that you cannot given the fact that you cannot do that with most(or is it all?) carriers. \n\nNow if you're flying on CX or Dragon Air on an award redemption and want to upgrade, I believe the premium economy restriction does not apply. So there is a lot of assumptions in this reply and if I were you I would call in and reply back with your findings.

My wife and I are looking to travel to Scotland in 2020, preferably in a window somewhere between April - August. We're flexible on the particular days, as we both work remotely and can schedule fairly freely.

One particular activity we wanted to enjoy was a tour of the sites from the novel ""Outlander"", but other than that we're pretty open to what we want to do while there.

We're based out of Chicago, but we can fly to JFK/LGA to get cheaper redemptions for the trip to Scotland, plus it allows us opportunity to try out the Centurion lounge. We'd like to fly Business class if possible.

51,Trip Report - Cathay Pacific 777-300ER First Class - HKG-ORD,24,48fzs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/48fzs5/trip_report_cathay_pacific_777300er_first_class/,23,1456863779.0,"This was the tail end flight of a 2 week jaunt I had throughout Asia a few weeks back. As always, you can read the whole [report with pictures here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/review-cathay-pacific-777-300er-first-class-hkg-ord/). As a reminder, make sure you are posting up your trip reports - economy included!

This flight was part of the American Airlines award ticket I booked from Singapore back to Orlando. Since this segment was included in my American Airlines redemption, it set me back 67,500 AAdvantage miles. By comparison, paid tickets were running ~$10,200 for a one-way flight on this route in first class, so when you factor in the business class ticket from Singapore and a connecting flight to Orlando, that is an absolutely stellar redemption value.

As we exited The Wing First Class Lounge (which was ""meh"" compared to the incredible The Pier First Class Lounge) we turned left and were pretty much right at our gate. Before you could enter the gate area there was a queue of people where security was “searching” people’s bags. They basically just opened my bag up and moved a jacket over, then re-closed it. It really give me a strong sense of safety and security on this flight.

**Cathay Pacific 806**

**Hong Kong (HKG) – Chicago-O’Hare (ORD)**

**Depart: 11:50 AM**

**Arrive: 12:25 PM**

**Duration: 12 hours, 35 minutes**

**Aircraft: Boeing 777-300ER**

**Seat: 2A (First Class)**


By the time we reached the gate, boarding of all cabins had already begun. There was a separate line for first class, business class and economy passengers. We proceeded directly to the first class line where our tickets were scanned and we were directed down the jet bridge. We entered through door 1L and turned right into the first class cabin. We were met at the door by the purser who directed us to our seats – 1A and 2A.

Cathay Pacific’s 777-3ooERs feature only 6 seats in First Class in a 1-1-1 configuration.

[CX F Cabin Layout](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CX-Layout.png?w=397)

I much prefer seats 1A and 2A as they are the only two seats that share the aisle on the left hand side of the aircraft which makes it feel much more private. The middle seats are completely blocked off, so you really have a sense that you are in your own world.

[Divider On Left Side Of Aircraft](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2567.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After making my way back to seat 2A, I saw home for the next 12 hours.

[CX F Seat](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2539.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

One thing to note about the first class cabin is that there are no overhead bins like JAL offers on their 777-300ERs. Instead, there are little lockers that you can store your bags in. The problem is, they are pretty tight – especially for a 22″ roller bag like I travel with. This locker is also where you are supposed to hang your jacket, which with a bag in there just does not work. Sorry for the poor picture quality of the locker.

[CX F Locker For Bags](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2682.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I ended up needing to place the blanket on my ottoman as it was originally in the locker and would not fit with my two bags – an exceedingly poor design in my opinion. After some finagling I was able to get my two carry on bags stored and started to check out the seat. Waiting at the seat was a pillow which was rather thin.

[CX F Seat](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2537.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

To the left of the seat was the seat controller screen and the in-flight entertainment (IFE) system remote control.

[CX F Controllers](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2541.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The seat controller is a touch screen unit that was not super responsive. I am not sure if that was just my seat, but I consistently had to touch the screen multiple times in different areas to get the seat to move at all.

[CX F Seat Controller](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2578.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Below the seat controls and IFE controller there is a storage area which was relatively shallow, but was good for holding my computer and cell phone chargers.

[CX F Seat Storage](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2562.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The seat is incredibly spacious at 36″ of width and features an armrest that drops down from the side of the seat.

[CX F Seat Armrest](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2568.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I actually really like this feature as it allows you plenty of space if you are lounging in the seat, while also offering you some more traditional seat structure when you wanted to do some work.

Opposite the seat was a nice ottoman which features storage underneath and can double as a companion seat if you wanted to dine with a travel companion.

[CX F Ottoman](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2538.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

To the left of the ottoman was an international style power plug along with a USB and S-Video plug.

To the right of the ottoman was the IFE screen, which fits into the storage locker area.

[IFE Screen 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2540.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The IFE screen is also a touch screen and swings out and pivots around to wherever you desire.

Also waiting at the seat was the traditional orchid which was real and is a very classy touch.

After getting settled in the in-flight service manager, Alina, came by to introduce herself and welcome us aboard. We were offered our selection of a pre-departure beverage and although I am not really a champagne fan, I opted for a glass of champagne.

[Pre-Departure Beverage](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2543.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We were also offered the traditional amuse bouche, which was a smoked tuna and mango dish that was very tasty.

[Amuse Bouche](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2542.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific serves Krug champagne in their first class cabin. Everyone always raves about it, but I honestly just do not get it. It tasted no different to me than most other champagnes. After the smoke tuna amuse Alina brought out piping hot towels, which was really nice.

Alina then came back around with pajamas, which were Pye.

[CX F Pajamas 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2552.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific’s First Class pajamas are a burgundy color and really made me feel like an emperor since the top has buttons from top to bottom. They seemed to run true to size.

[CX F Pajamas 2](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2635.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Also included in the pajama bag were a pair of slippers and a Cathay Pacific branded eye mask.

[CX F Pajamas 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2637.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The pajamas were comfortable and fairly soft, but I have to give the edge to JAL on comfort and softness when it comes to their pajamas.

Alina also handed me an Aesop amenity kit. There were separate amenity kits for male and female passengers.

[Amenity Kit 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2549.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The male amenity kit included a comb, a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, face cream, a glass cleaning cloth, ear plugs and body lotion.

[Amenity Kit 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2641.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Lastly, Alina passed out a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones which were very comfortable.

[Noise Cancelling Headphones](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2550.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

While checking out the cabin I noticed there was a hump in the ceiling which was direct above seat 1D.

[Ceiling Hump](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2558.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cool random fact – that is actually the pilot rest area and there is a little bed up there!

One thing to note about Cathay Pacific’s First Class seats is that while they are in the upright position, it is quite a stretch to reach the ottoman. I am 6’5″ and could barely reach it myself. And yes, those are crabs on my socks – my sock game is on point.

[Stretched Out To Ottoman](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2551.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I spent the remainder of the boarding process enjoying some great views of the 777-300ER parked next to us.

[CX 777-300ER](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2555.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

There also happened to be an older gentleman on the flight who was in seat 2K who had been bumped up from Business Class to First Class. He spent pretty much the entire boarding time calling anyone and everyone he could to let them know that he had been bumped up to First Class. Based on his baggage choice (Rimowa) and his familiarity with the aircraft, he seemed like he was a regular traveler, so the phone calls surprised me a bit. But then again, who among us does not love a free op-up upgrade?!

About 10 minutes before we pushed back, the Australian captain came on the PA to welcome everyone aboard. He also advised us that he strongly recommended that we keep our seat belts fastened as he expected it to be a bumpy ride over the northern Pacific. Within a few minutes the cabin doors were closed and we pushed back.

As the safety video played, my eyes were glued to the window as Hong Kong Airport offers some great views while taxiing.

[HKG Taxiing 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2571.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

[HKG Taxiing 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2563.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We taxied right past the 747 cargo planes, which always makes me happy to see a 747 in the wild.

[HKG Taxiing 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2565.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Interestingly, while we were on an active taxi way, the first officer came out from the cockpit, opened door 1L and then re-closed it. I am guessing this was due to a sensor in the cockpit showing that door 1L was still open, but the re-opening and closing was never explained to anyone. Apparently re-closing the door seemed to work as we continued our taxi after that.

One thing I found very cool is that Cathay Pacific’s IFE system on their 777-300ERs features an outside camera which is mounted on the bottom of the fuselage just behind the front wheel. My eyes were glued to it during the takeoff.

[Exterior Camera View](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2560.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We took off from runway 7R and were quickly airborne rolling out over Kowloon Island and Hong Kong Island. It was a crystal clear day so the views were spectacular.

[Hong Kong Views 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2576.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

About 10 minutes after takeoff the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off. The two flight attendants working the First Class cabin – Joy and Ibuki – then came around presenting passengers with the menu for the flight. The menu was served on a nice wooden plate.

[CX F Menu 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2583.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Since our flight coincided with the Chinese New Year, Cathay Pacific was offering special puddings on the flight to celebrate the Year of the Monkey. Neither sounded very appealing to me, so I never tried either.

[CX F CNY Menu](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2585.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The drink menu was quite extensive as well and featured some very good wines.

[CX F Drink Menu 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2589.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Lunch service began promptly and started with a serving of warm mixed nuts. I opted for another glass of champagne, mainly because I would be trying the caviar again to see if the combination would somehow win me over (spoiler alert – it did not).

[CX F Lunch Warm Mixed Nuts](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2606.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific puts some kind of smoke seasoning on their nuts which I really just do not care for as it is pretty overpowering.

Joy then came around to set my table, which pulls out from the compartment to the left of the seat. The lunch service started with a tin of caviar.

[Caviar Service 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2617.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cathay Pacific serves Calvisius caviar.

[Caviar Service 2](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2618-e1456764270567.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The caviar was served with the usual accompaniments, a bread basket and a glass of still water.

[Caviar Service 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2615.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The bread basket contained an assortment of rolls and a piece of Cathay Pacific’s delicious garlic bread.

[Bread Basket](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2619.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Also served on the tray was a nice hand written note from Joy and Ibuki wishing me an enjoyable flight.

[Note From FAs](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2616.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I thought this was a really nice personal touch.

I have to say though, I just do not get the love that people have for champagne and caviar. I was trying hard this trip to understand it, but I just could not.

After the caviar, Joy brought me a bowl of the cream of chicken soup.

[Cream of Chicken Soup Starter](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2622.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

It was served at the perfect temperature and very tasty.

Next came the mesclun salad.

[Salad starter](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2623.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

It was very colorful and nicely presented, but kind of bland tasting.

For my main course I opted for the pan fried prawns with risotto.

[Pan Fried Prawns 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2626.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The prawns were just ok and somewhat bland themselves and the risotto was more of a rice pilaf than a risotto.

[Pan Fried Prawns 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2625.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After the main course, Ibuki brought me a hot towel and took my order for dessert.

[Post Lunch Hot Towel](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2627.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I decided to be a fat kid for dessert since I could not decided between the berries and cream and the fruit tart – so I ordered both.

[Berries & Cream Dessert](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2628.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The berries and cream were beautifully presented and very delicious. The cream was more of a milky yogurt consistency, but the combination was still excellent.

I also ordered a cappuccino with dessert, which was served with brown sugar cubes.

[Cappuccino](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2633.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Ibuki also brought my cappuccino with cocoa dusted almonds, a truffle and a chocolate bar with almonds in it – all of which were excellent.

[Sweets Assortment](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2632.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The real star of dessert though was the almond pear tart. It was served with salted caramel ice cream and was incredible. It was so good I would literally fly Cathay Pacific again for that alone.

[Almond Pear Tart](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2634.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The lunch service lasted about an hour and a half from start to finish. After lunch I went into the lavatory to change into my pajamas. The lavatories had a somewhat modern feel to them and in the First Class cabin feature real linen towels.

[CX F Lavatory](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2545.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

As with the amenity kit, the lotions and soaps in the lavatory are also Aesop.

[CX Lavatory Lotions & Soaps](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2547.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

One thing I will note is that on our JAL flight, the flight attendants took my clothes and hung them up for me in the closet. On our Cathay Pacific flight that did not happen. I am guessing that is because there is a locker with hangers in it at every seat, but with a roller bag stowed in the there is no room to actually hang clothes. It was a poor layout in my opinion and was another example of why I actually prefer JAL First Class to Cathay Pacific First Class.

After I changed into the pajamas I perused the CX Studio options looking for something to watch while relaxing.

[CX Studio 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2608.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cathay’s CX Studio selection is quite vast and includes everything from current popular TV shows like HBO’s Ballers to new (to video) release movies like Our Brand Is Crisis. I opted to watch Our Brand Is Crisis and it was quite good.

It is also worth noting that if you are traveling with young children, CX Studio offers a separate kids entertainment section.

[CX Studio Kids](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2613.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After watching Our Brand Is Crisis, I pulled my laptop out to do some work. I also ordered a glass of the Glenmorangie Signet.

[Glenmorangie Signet 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2644.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The Signet was very good and I had several more after that.

[Glenmorangie Signet 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2645.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

In fact, I finished half the bottle before I knew it! That made me a bit sleepy so I ended up ~~passing out~~ sleeping for about an hour. When I woke up I decided to watch another movie. This time I opted to watch Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks. Being a history nerd, I thought the movie was excellent. I also ordered another cappuccino which was served with a little biscotti cookie.

[Cappuccino & Biscotti](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2647.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

During the movie I started to get a bit hungry. I had been craving a burger and sure enough, there was one on the snack menu! The snack menu read as follows:

[CX F Snack Menu](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2587.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

When I ordered the burger Ibuki told me it would probably take about 20 minutes to prepare, which was no problem. About 20 minutes later Ibuki brought the burger out with a glass of ice water.

[CX F Snack](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2649.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I gotta say, I pride myself on fully immersing myself in the local culture when I travel, but after 2 weeks, this burger was damn good! The beef was actually cooked to a nice medium, was juicy and very flavorful. I had debated between the British tea trio and the burger since I knew the tea trio was also very good, but I am very happy I opted for the burger instead.

I ended up doing a few more hours worth of work at which time we were approaching the west coast of the Canada. The sunrise from 40,000 feet is always awe inspiring to me.

[Sunrise Over West Coast](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2669.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I guess if I had to pick an office view, this would definitely be the one I would pick.

[""Office"" View](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2671.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

About a half hour later Joy came by to take my order for breakfast. The breakfast menu read as follows:

[CX F Breakfast Menu](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2587.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I ordered scrambled eggs with fresh fruit, yogurt, a banana muffin and a Hong Kong style milk tea, which Cathay Pacific executes excellently in my opinion.

Breakfast started with a warm towel.

[CX F Pre-Breakfast Warm Towel](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2673.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

At that point we hit some pretty bad turbulence which put a stop to the meal service as the captain asked the flight attendants to take their seats. That lasted for about 35 minutes after which point the meal service was resumed.

Joy came back to set my table and started me off with some fresh fruit and the banana muffin.

[CX F Breakfast 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2674.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The fresh fruit was good, though I really do not like the grapes they serve on Cathay Pacific as they contain big seeds.

[Fresh Fruit](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2675.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The banana muffin was insanely good and was served piping hot.

[Banana Muffin](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2676.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Joy then came back with my Hong Kong style milk tea which was well executed as always and paired nicely with the banana muffin.

[Hong Kong Style Milk Tea](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2678.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Next the yogurt was served separately. I had never had this particular brand before, but it was very good.

[Strawberry Yogurt](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2680.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After the yogurt, Joy came back with my main course – the scrambled eggs.

[Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Sausage & Potatoes](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2681.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

To be honest, it was pretty disappointing. The eggs were soft scrambled and runny, which I do not care for. The potatoes were soft, mushy and a bit on the chewy side. The bacon was almost entirely fat and the sausage link actually did not look fully cooked when I cut into it. I had a few bites of the eggs and left the rest. It was not quite as bad as the egg dish on Hong Kong Airlines, but it was pretty close.

After I finished breakfast I headed to the lavatory to change out of my pajamas. By the time I had re-stowed my bags and got settled back into my seat we were starting our descent into Chicago.

[Airshow](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2724.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I enjoyed some of the views of the Illinois coast as we came in.

[Illinois Coast On Approach](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2686.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

It was a pretty clear day and our routing took us right past downtown and the Sears Tower.

[Downtown Chicago](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2688.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We also ended up with a pretty good view of Navy Pier as we came around on approach.

[Navy Pier 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2690.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

As we started our final approach into O’Hare, I switched on the nose camera to enjoy the view on landing.

We had a smooth touchdown about 10 minutes earlier than our scheduled arrival time. It was a fairly short taxi to the gate, but there was some cool air traffic on the ground like this Korean Air 777-300ER on its way to Seoul.

After a quick 5 minute taxi we arrived at our gate. We thanked the cabin crew on our way off and then headed for immigration which we cleared quickly thanks to Global Entry.

The crew on this flight were good, but I cannot say that they were great. While both Joy and Ibuki were very nice and extremely attentive, it did not seem like Joy really wanted to be there – and it showed. As is typical with Cathay Pacific, the flight attendants take a more hands off approach to give their passengers some privacy. Though as soon as you hit the flight attendant call button they are at your seat within seconds.

Overall, I think it was a very good flight, though I have to give the edge to JAL on food and service. The Cathay Pacific seat is incredibly comfortable and the IFE system is definitely designed better though so Cathay beats out JAL on those items. At the end of the day though, we are really just splitting hairs here are both are an exceptional way to travel though!","['Nice!

The amount of food you get at the dining room in The Pier (or The Wing as apparently I missed the dining room in the back corner) is not massive. The buffet spread is decent, though I don't think it is particularly pig out worthy (as it's mostly snack foods, pastries, etc.). If you have a long layover, I would go to The Pier first and grab breakfast/lunch/dinner before your flight. Your meal service will start right after you takeoff, so I wouldn't be too worried about going hungry. There's also a snack menu that's on demand which is quite good.

52,Airline Loyalty Advice,9,5bmwj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5bmwj6/airline_loyalty_advice/,23,1478563051.0,"I'll be starting a new job soon that will have me traveling domestically with about two roundtrip flights each month on average.  I'm going back and forth between American and United for loyalty purposes.  Both seem to provide good coverage to the Midwest (where I'll be traveling most) from my home base, DCA.

I definitely prefer the experience on American over United, and American award flights seem to be better values than United awards, but I'm wondering if I should be more concerned about aligning my CC spend to the airline of choice.  As of right now, I have the whole gamut of Chase UR cards that I love because of their point-earning opportunities and their benefits (CSR, Freedom, FU, Ink, etc), which obviously better suites United.  I do have the Citi AA Plat as well, which I wasn't planning on holding onto past the annual fee but it certainly is an option if it's for the best.  *I plan on keeping my CSR long term as I get to charge all work expenses to my personal cards.*

What I suppose this boils down to are the following questions:

1) I plan to maintain the vast majority of my spend on the Chase cards.  Should I pick United over American since the points are transferable?

2) Should I keep the Citi AA Plat and charge only flights to it?  Does this help me earn status faster?

3) Are there any finer points to this that I seem to be missing?  My priorities are very close between gaining status and getting award flights, but I suppose status squeaks by on top since I can churn my way to award flights for now.

Thank you all for your help!  On a side note, I just redeemed 160k AA for F and 130k UR for J on United for my SO and I to take a Japan trip.  I'll be sure to do a trip report when finished.


EDIT:  Just wanted to say thanks for all of the insight, and to correct my incorrect use of wordz.","['AFAIK American has far more nonstops out of DCA. If you were flying out of Dulles United would make more sense. \n\n1) Your spend should be going on the CSR. I\'d take 3x UR over 2x AA any day of the week.  \n\n2) No, it does not help you earn status faster. It may be worth keeping for the free bag and 10% back perks. \n\n3) You can run the numbers and see if crediting your flights to Alaska makes more sense. If you\'re flying short hops on the company\'s dime, however, the revenue based earning of AA night make more sense. \n\nAlso:\n\n>whole gambit\n\nI think you mean ""whole gamut"" ', ""Copy and Pasted from a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/2u269q/combining_ba_marriott_premier_hilton_hhonors/co4q0mg/) I made a while back, so some of the cards/benefits/transfer partners may have changed, but, as someone who travels for work, these are my thoughts:  \n  \n  \n  \n1. Work towards elite status at an Airline, a hotel and (if possible) a car rental service. Status gets you free, unplanned perks that make travel easy (free baggage check, upgrades, drinks, boarding priority, lounge entry, etc). Elite status also lets you earn more reward points per mile flown or dollar spent.  \n  \n2. Try to structure your credit card rewards around the airlines/hotels you aim to achieve status with. For example, I fly Delta every week. AMEX points (Membership Rewards) transfer to Delta. Chase points (Ultimate rewards) do not. Thus, ***TO ME*** AMEX points are far more valuable than Chase Points.  \n  \n3. It's still important to diversify your points portfolio, but (unless you have a specific destination in mind), it makes sense to focus your credit card selection around the partners you frequent (applies big time to hotels). There's not much point to having the Hyatt card if you stay in a Hilton every week - Why get 1 Hyatt point (from the card) and 2 Hilton points (from the stay) for each dollar if you can get 10 Hilton points for each dollar spent using the hilton card? The exception to this rule is SPG. SPG points can transfer to a bunch of sources. Transferable credit card programs are great. Transferable credit card point programs that transfer to the brands you frequent are BEST (see point #2).  \n  \n4. Cards/programs that allow you to redeem points as 'travel cash' (ie. Barclays, Chase) sort of have an added value since Flights/hotels booked with these options still count towards your status (see point #1). For example, if I transfer 25k MR points to Delta Skymiles, then book a reward flight to Hawaii. This trip does not count towards my status. However, if I use UR points to book through Chase (where all travel is 20% off and 1 point can be redeemed for 1.2 cents), your Miles/Segments will count towards status. Not the most cost effective use of points, but it's a free way to travel AND get points towards status.  \n  \n5. Work your crossover rewards. When you get elite status with Delta AND SPG, you can get Delta points for staying at an SPG property and SPG points for flying on Delta. Lots of hotels/airlines have these services. Take a look.  \n  \nFinally, if you have the choice, make Starwood hotels your hotel chain.  IMO the quality of their rooms, service and reward points are the best. Unfortunately, their locations aren't always.  If you're in a major city, you can usually find one.  If you travel to distribution centers in middle america every week (like me), you may be hard-pressed to find a Starwood property nearby.  \n  \nSo, to answer your question directly:  \n>Is it a mistake to spread out my rewards on different cards, as opposed to racking them all up on one flexible program in the BA+?  \n  \nYou should do both.  My weekly spend looks like the following:  \n  \n * $500 - $700/week Delta - Earning 9 miles/$, 7 miles/$ from flying (silver status), 2 miles/$ from Delta Gold card    \n * $400 - $600/week Hilton - Earning 12 miles/$, booking a king suite that gives me double points, then x6 from HHonors card\n * ~$250/week Restaurants - Earning 2 UR points/$ on CSP  \n * ~$150/week personal spending - Earning 1.5 MR points/$ on AMEX Everyday preferred  \n  \nWhen I add to my wallet next, it will likely be a very transferable partner (AMEX Gold, Barclays Arrival+, AMEX SPG, or Diner's Club, if they ever give a good sign up bonus).  Notice that, while all of these partners are very transferable, 3 of the 4 allow me to transfer directly to one of my frequent traveler programs (AMEX to Hilton & Delta, SPG to Delta, DC to Delta and Hilton).  Whenever I get the AMEX gold, I will start putting all my flights on that (3 MRs/$ >>> 2 Skymiles/$). However, I also have the option to send miles to other programs, such as Avios, if I want to travel somewhere for fun that Delta cannot go."", ""Loyalty is extremely overrated unless you can get status. \n\nIf you think you can get status, always fly that airline when possible.\n\nAmerican and United basically have the same award pricing for awards tickets. Your Citi AA Plat gives 10% rebate, so they're kinda cheaper. UA are easier for you to earn via CSR. It's a wash.\n\nBoth programs are revenue based now (5 miles per $). Both are extremely similar in terms of qualifications for elite status--25k/50k/100k. UA has an additional 75k level. \n\nNeither airline has a card that substantially enhances the travel experience for a business traveler where you can expense checked bag fees (each airline has cards that allow free bag). Both airline cards give 2x awards for airfare, but so does the CSP. CSR in fact gives 3x, which is better, and has better travel insurance. Again, of course, if your travel plans go wrong, you can expense these anyway. \n\nI would not even charge AA flights to the AA Plat. Keep the plat for the benefits. Having the card gives you free bag on AA, doesn't require ticket to be charged to it. AA effectively has cheaper award flights due to the 10% rebate with your AA Plat.\n\n**If you really want status**, it **might** make sense to get the $500 AA card that comes with EQMs and lounge access. AA lounges are typically also not accessible by your CSR PP. \n\n1. Pick which airline you want to get status on, and book as many flights on it as possible. I would book with CSR or Amex Platinum. \n\n2. Keep it if you plan to fly AA, want a free bag on every flight, and enjoy the discounted awards to certain cities and the 10% miles rebate on reward travel. **I would not put any spending on it,** but would continue to put flights on CSR. (3x vs 2x, plus better insurance, plus UR instead of AA). \n\n3. No, although if you are taking lots of flights that are longer than 5 times the dollar value of your fare (i.e., your $300 flight is >1500 miles round trip) consider crediting your flights to a partner airline. For instance SQ Status allows you to access domestic UA lounges even when you aren't flying first class, whereas UA requires F ticket. This is prob moot point if you have CSR. \n"", 'As for 2, you can only gain status by completing segments on AA.', ""Seems like you understand the tradeoffs and others have commented on domestic issues so I will just say - consider alliance partners to places you will go or might like to go. I disavowed Delta but gave them another look because I've been hitting all the Delta hubs recently and have an Amex Platinum, SPG status via Marriott for crossover rewards, and thus I'm actually status match challenging from AA platinum right now.

My family would LOVE to go to Germany. We can only travel From June 10th through August. We're in San Diego. What are my best options for flights?

My parents are elderly immigrants who will retire back to the home country in a couple of years. Hawaii has always been one of their dreams but they're also worried about spending money on travel (they lost everything when they immigrated in their 40s). I've offered to pay for it but they have always refused. The only trips they're willing to take on my dime are award trips. I'm unfortunately tapped out in that regard for a while, but they have agreed to let me open a few credit cards for them and use the signup bonuses to get them to Hawaii. (I can get the minimum spend on a card easily through my business.)  


I've already gotten each a Marriott card with the 100K bonus so I think we'll be set on hotels. However, it looks difficult to get a business/first roundtrip from Nashville to Koa with the currently available bonuses. I think the American Airlines 60K bonuses can handle the trip in one direction, but still looking for the best way to get the other. They're flexible with their schedule so any time next year should work, though I've generally planned on March or so.

55,[award advice] 30th birthday trip to Thailand/Hong Kong,6,7pa68p,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7pa68p/award_advice_30th_birthday_trip_to_thailandhong/,23,1515560123.0,"My husband and I have 350,000 UR points, with about 10K scattered around in Southwest, American, and British Airways. We live in Austin, and, while we could theoretically drive to SA or Houston to fly out, we have pets that need to be boarded, and my husband will need to come back on his own (see below for more info), so we both need easy access to home on our return.

We are looking to go to Thailand early May of this year. We would fly there together, but then my husband will come back on his own to Austin (limited vacation time), and I will fly to Hong Kong to meet a friend for a few days before returning home. We would prefer economy flights, unless there is a really good deal on a higher class cabin (but we would never pay cash for that, so are not necessarily looking to just splurge).

I've looked at prices on Google flights to start getting an idea of airlines that go where we need them to go, and it seems that there are nearly no 1-stop flights from Austin to Bangkok, and many of the flights offered on there are mixed airlines (i.e. not in the same alliance). We want to use points for the entire trip, and I would love to have him fly back from Thailand to somewhere state-side direct (although I'm actually surprised that there might not be any--I thought for sure BKK>LAX would exist but it doesn't!), but if that's not possible, he is an anxious traveler, so connecting him through one very user-friendly for English speakers airport would be fantastic. I am thinking that we will need to book 2 one-way flights, so that we can ensure we are on the same booking number on the way out, but on the way back, I will need to book separate flights.

This is all very complicated to me! Any insights or suggestions?

EDIT: I found an AUS>LAX>SIN>BKK flight on United for 40K, with the SIN>BKK segment being on Singapore Airlines (which I would love to experience, even if it's just cattle class)! I think I will go ahead and book that, which based on the comments so far seems like par for what I should expect to spend on the flight and a decently good flight itinerary. If anyone also has any great hotel UR redemptions for while we are in Thailand, that would also be appreciated! Thanks so far everyone!","['If you leave from AUS, it is going to be 2 stops, period. And yes, there is no US-BKK nonstop flight. If you want 1-stop trip, then you must leave from IAH. \n\nThe easiest option, in my opinion, is to book through UA (80K RT in economy). Looking on their website, it typically seems to route you through IAH or ORD and then onwards to Tokyo and to BKK. Star Alliance has several Asian Partners, so availability is generally great, and you might find some routes through Seoul on Asiana or Taipei on EVA. \n\nFor you, you could book open jaw (return from HKG) and your husband is just AUS-BKK RT.

If they’re on separate tickets, you could run into trouble if one flight is late. The airlines in that case aren’t obligated to do anything for you. Connections between different airlines that don’t normally codeshare could also require transferring from one airport terminal to another, which adds time and complexity.\n\nThis is especially true for inexperienced travelers who want to keep stress to a minimum.\n', 'BBK is far out there, need to stops from AUS.  that leave with you connecting via Hong Kong, china, japan.\n\nyou can transfer from UR to United and the flight is about 80k per person rt.

We can transfer UR points to United, so we could transfer exactly enough needed for two one ways in business and zero my United account out.

The talks, which are at a preliminary stage, would see Emirates acquire the main airline business of Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, which would keep its maintenance arm, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. The negotiations could yet fall through, they said.

Both airlines initially declined to comment, before later denying that any talks were underway. Were a transaction to go ahead the enlarged airline operation would be bigger than that of [American Airlines Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAL:US), which has a market value of $19.2 billion.

Any deal would require the blessing of the rulers of the richest sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates. For Abu Dhabi, which sits on 6 percent of global oil reserves, it would advance a drive to overhaul state-controlled entities as it adapts to lower crude prices. The airlines have traditionally been arch rivals, with their hubs competing to attract the same transfer passengers making long-distance trips between Asia and the West.""

He is going to France to study. So he was scared and paid whatever they asked.

I feel like this is an exorbitant amount for one checked bag. When I called American airlines, since they issued the ticket, they told me to got to Etihad since they ran the flights and Etihad redirected me to American saying they issued the ticket. So I was being bounced around all day.

Usually international flights come with atleast one checked bag as far as i know. Even when I was talking to Etihad they told me that usually the ticket should come with one checked bag but it doesnt in this case which ""could"" be an error, and if it is it would be on the American airlines side since they issued the ticket.

I was able to find two separate flights through BA and AA, however, with a 3-hour window between the two:

&#x200B;

Reservation 1: TXL to LHR- 7:05am -8:10am (BA, 7.5k Avios, Business)

Reservation 2: LHR - DFW - SHV Departs 11:25am (AA, 22.5 miles, Economy)

&#x200B;

Because the first flight on BA is only available in business, it won't show up in AA's system. And the AA flight won't show up in BA's system-- probably because it involves travel on American Eagle. So I am considering booking the reservations separately, knowing that I might be SOL if something happens to my first flight.

&#x200B;

**With this in mind:**

1. Is this too risky given the 3-hour window I have?
2. Can I check in online through the AA app and simply transfer terminals at LHR?
3. Would any credit card such as the CSR or Amex Platinum help me if I missed my second flight?

I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex’s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The “high season” is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 “high season” will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The “low season” is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “low season” and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “high season”. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “low season” and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “high season”.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions – Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic’s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al’s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al’s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (“WS”) is January 1 – March 24 and November 1 – December 31, while the Summer Season (“SS”) is March 25 – October 31.  El Al’s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan – from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!","['Oh this is Very Nice!

63,"I feel like I’m being cheated by the SPG program and points in general, is there a really simple way to book this trip? Questions",0,5pjux2,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5pjux2/i_feel_like_im_being_cheated_by_the_spg_program/,22,1485149799.0,"Feel free to skip around:

**I. The Backstory**

**II. The Confusion**

**III. The Questions**


**The Backstory**

Let me know if this is the wrong sub for this but I thought it was the closest as far as audience and my question, so thanks for any help!

A few years ago when I graduated college and it was time to move off of my “baby” bank account arrangements and into the bigger leagues, I was talking with my dad and Uncles about what card to get. This was 3-4 years ago and they all said hands down that the American Express SPG card was the card to get. The reasons why were something like that it got you really good rates or free nights at a lot of awesome hotels around the world and that the points could easily transfer to airlines miles on other airlines. I didn’t do a ton of research at the time and thought hey, what the heck, let me get this card and see if it really is worth it.

As the years went by and I booked vacations, I found myself more and more drawn to staying at AirBNBs. I really like the “authentic” kind of feel and not being surrounded by tourists, who knows how long that might last, but for now it’s awesome and me and my girlfriend 95% of the time go with an AirBNB or rental house instead of a hotel. I would also attempt to book flights over the years using the SPG portal but found it really confusing and counterintuitive to use. So I waited and just thought I’d accrue the points and spend them all at once.

At this point, I’ve racked up like 164,000 Starwood points. My girlfriend and I are planning a trip to Costa Rica in February and we’ve already found an amazing house on AirBNB for far cheaper than any of the “luxury” hotels, and booked it.

I thought hey, this seems like a good time to redeem my points and book our flights, and that’s where the confusion begins!

**The Confusion**

I started on Kayak for the cheapest flights and found them. They were on multiple airlines and were Hacker Fares. No problem, let me switch to one airline so the points transfer is easy. Now the flights are twice as expensive. Ok, no problem, we’re using points here so I guess I just eat it like that. Go to book directly on the airline’s site and the prices go up even more. The total is going to be like 135,000 points to book two of us round trip on a flight that’s semi-reasonable (8-10 hours, 1 layover). 

I go to book the flight and to do so I have to transfer my points to miles. That’s when I find out that you can only transfer 94,999 points maximum per month or per redemption or something.

So now it’s looking like I’ll have to still pay for some part of this flight by purchasing miles that I’ll be locked into on a specific airline even though I have more than enough points to pay for this flight.

Honestly, I feel like I’m being fleeced. I’ve also heard that SPG flights redeems at a much lower redemption value the more expensive the flights gets if you book directly through them.

TL; DR; - I feel like redeeming my Starwood Points is really hard for my use case and I’m being fleeced when I try to do it. I have these questions:

**III. The Questions**

1) What’s the most efficient way to deal with this current situation? Do I just try to force it with points, transferring as many as I can to the airline then buying the rest of my ticket, book directly through SPG, or should I just wait until I go to Thailand or something and book that directly through SPG to blow them all at once?

2) Are there any cards that have really good benefits but are also really, really transparent in how you can accrue and use them? I’m really sick of all the terms and conditions and finding out later on that I can be screwed pretty much at will and the rules can constantly change, and that if I go through the company’s branded portal I get screwed.

When you pay for travel expenses on the card, you can redeem miles to offset those charges at a rate of 100 points per dollar. Spend $300 on an airbnb? Redeem up to 30,000 miles to offset that charge or part of it. Plus, you get a refund of 5% of your redeemed miles - so you'd end up with 1,500 miles back.

Thanks to /r/churning, this was my first major trip with award redemptions. I simply could not have taken this trip without the skills I've learned from this community. So a big 'Thank You' before I dig into the details. Also, if you are more into a report with photos, I've posted it [here](http://www.livewellsimply.com/trip-report-tokyo-la-first-class-jal-experience/). 
  
  
**It all started with the [AA devaluations](https://www.aa.com/i18n/AAdvantage/redeemMiles/american-airlines-award-chart2016.jsp).** I decided I wanted to burn some miles on a 1st class experience before the 'price' jumped by several thousand miles and sooner rather than later. Deciding on a destination was based on which first class cabin I wanted to experience. The [JAL 1st class suites](https://www.jal.co.jp/en/inter/service/first/) really piqued my interest after reading [this trip report](http://flight-report.com/en/report-6625.html). So, using the BA website, I looked for one way availability on either the ORD, JFK or LAX to NRT routes. Amazingly, the ORD-NRT had 2 seats available April 5th which coincided perfectly with the cherry blossom season in the Tokyo area. Yay! I called AA and booked the flight on JAL using 62,500 AA miles. Incidentally, at the time I booked this trip, the ticket was showing up for $13,000 (not that anyone would actually pay that price). 

**Below**, I've listed the highlights and at the bottom of the trip report you'll find my spending totals in miles and USD. 


**Flagship Admiral's Club Lounge at ORD**
Food and drink options were excellent. I got in early enough to sample both breakfast and lunch offerings at the lounge.

**First class check-in and boarding experience.** Walking past the long line of economy passengers I was whisked to seat 1K

**Pre-flight** I was offered orange juice or champagne. I picked champagne. This was the first time I ever consumed alcoholic beverages on a flight and I likely won't do it again due to the dehydration effect combined with the dry air on-board a pressurized cabin. 

**Once airborne**, the flight attendant set my table with a slightly faded brown table cloth and presented me with a menu and hot towelette to wash my hands.  
**The menu** contained a six course meal with either Western or Japanese menu items. I chose the Western menu as I wasn't sure how the Japanese menu items would affect my digestive experience. Most of the food was excellent, except for the garlic bread that tasted like it had sat forgotten in a lunchroom microwave for a day. I had caviar for the first time and enjoyed it. 


**The 23 inch display** was great to watch a few selections from the massive Music, TV and Film digital library. 


**Lie flat bed** was comfortable, with JAL issue PJ's 
Personal coffee pot and the unique JAL coffee mug with the long handle that touched the table. 


**Arrival at airport**
Passport control was a breeze with no wait time.


**Finding the Hilton shuttle** at bus stop 26, not 16 as indicated on Hilton app was annoying but made less so by a helpful attendant who spoke no English but recognized the Hilton picture on my phone and pointed out the number of the bus stop. 


**Check in to hotel**
High tech toilet with spray options and music was entertaining. Complimentary bottled water. bathrobe and disposable slippers were a nice touch. There was an a-la-carte bar containing various drinks and snacks with prices listed on a sheet of paper that I didn't make use of. 


**Woke up early** due to jet lag. Took first shuttle at 4:45 AM to ORD, only to discover that Keisei ticket counters open at 7.  Bought round trip Skyliner Express and 48hr subway pass deal from [Keisei Electric Railroad](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/value_ticket/subway.php) for $46. 


**Arrived in Tokyo** in the pouring rain, bought an umbrella, and immediately took subway over to [fish market](http://www.tsukiji-market.or.jp/tukiji_e.htm). On the way, I stepped around a fight breaking out between two men on the subway platform. Police took five seconds to respond and break it up. It was the weirdest fight. No shouting. Just grunting pushing and grappling without any exchange of words. 


**Walked to fish market from closest subway station** and successfully dodged all the small truck/carts that were racing every which way. 
Got my fill of fish smells and dead fish viewing and moved on fairly soon. 

**[Imperial Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Imperial_Palace)** - this place was very quiet with a few brave tourists hanging out in the pouring rain and looking at the ancient buildings.


**Visited the [Aoyama cemetery](http://aroundtokyo.net/blog/aoyama-cemetery/).** The combination of rain, cherry blossoms and very ornate tombstone arrangements was tranquil and inexplicably enjoyable. 


**[Shibuya Crossing](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan/tokyo/sights/neighbourhoods-villages/shibuya-crossing)** was next. Bought a sandwich at Starbucks, headed to the second floor viewing area and took a time lapse video of the Shibuya Scramble on my iPhone.  Explored the Shibuya shopping district and ate some amazing sushi at this [stand up sushi bar](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066456-d1667264-Reviews-Uogashinihonichi-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html) right next to Burger King. 


Hiked around **[Meiji Jinju shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine)** for an hour or so. 


The [Metropolitan Government Building](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3011_tocho.html) had fairly decent daylight views of the city. But I was after something more. So...

**Timed my arrival at the [World Trade Center's](http://www.gotokyo.org/en/kanko/minato/spot/2600.html) 40th floor observatory** right at dusk as the rain clouds were being swept away revealing all the city lights and the Tokyo Tower lit brilliantly. I took a photo very similar to the one in the link above. 


**Exhausted I made my way to the [capsule hotel](http://www.agoda.com/shinjuku-kuyakusho-mae-capsule-hotel/hotel/tokyo-jp.html)** I had booked for $21 and fit my six foot frame diagonally in the capsule for a good night's sleep. Yep, they're small, but I had earplugs and a sleep aid and slept just fine. 


**Early morning, I headed over to the [Asakusa Shrine](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3004.html)** and wandered around people watching. Many people on their way to work would stop briefly to pray. 


**[Shinjuku Gyoen Park](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3034_001.html) was on my list** to do some more people watching and relax amid the cherry blossoms.  Upon entry all bags were being sniffed for presence of alcohol which is prohibited in the park. Apparently Japanese people like to drink rice wine and look at cherry blossoms. Who knew? The guard didn't even bother sniffing my bag or the Australian ahead of me in line as we weren't the 'target market'. 


**Takeshita-guchi** street shopping area. What a name, right?! This was a fun side excursion as I started making my way back to the airport.  


**Ueno Park shopping area**. I realized I hadn't picked up any souvenirs yet, so I stopped by the 'Japan Shop' just outside the Ueno train station. 


**Back to NRT** via return Skyliner Express ticket. Something new for me was airport security providing slippers to go through the metal detector as I had of course removed my shoes. At the gate, a **drum band dressed in traditional garb**, played for about 45 seconds and then provided a photo op for waiting passengers at the gate.


**Stopover in LA** I had a stopover in LA where I rented a car and drove around for a few hours. It was my first time in LA, so I went up to the Griffith Observatory, drove through Hollywood on Sunset Blvd and checked out some back roads in the Beverly Hills including Mulholland Drive. Then finished up with a walk on the Santa Monica Beach before heading back to the airport to continue on my journey home.


**Points & Miles Spent on 2 one-way tickets:**

* ORD-NRT 1st Class on JAL - 62,500 AA miles
* NRT-LAX-DFW economy on AA metal  -  25,000 AA miles
* Hilton Narita - 20,000 HHONORS points

**USD Spent**:

* Food/Drinks: $65 I ate sushi and trail mix. Drinks from vending machines
* Capsule Hotel: $21
* Skyliner Express and Subway Tickets: $46
* Souvenirs: $50
* PHL-ORD flight $40
* DFW-PHL flight $53
* Car rental at LAX to drive around and sight-see (first time in LA) $56
* Less than 21 day AA booking fees $75*2 = $150
* AA booking airport taxes $5.60*2 = $11.20

**TOTAL USD: $492.20 for 5 days of travel** 
I could have saved a bunch (splurged on Narita Express train and a full size car at LAX), but $100/day all in for a 5 day trip to Japan and LA is still a great deal in my experience. I also could have saved $150 on the AA booking, but was looking to sample the first class experience and last minute travel holds a certain thrill for me anyway. 


**Three things made this trip enjoyable and a memorable experience:**
> 1. Planning every detail of travel as well as building in some flexibility in the itinerary. 
> 2. Traveling with only a 12 lb backpack. 
> 3. Downloading Tokyo specific apps on my iPhone with full offline capabilities. 

Tokyo is an incredible city and I will definitely be back. The efficiency of the subway beats anything I've seen (and I've been to 20+ major global cities like NYC, Vancouver, Amsterdam, DC, etc). I hope this trip report inspires someone else to go out and explore our world helped by miles and points. :)

67,American Airlines Aadvantage Elite Status,0,7url6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7url6m/american_airlines_aadvantage_elite_status/,21,1517610003.0,"I am doing all the legwork for a family trip to Hawaii in June 2018 sponsored by the in-laws. Me, my wife, and my son will be traveling from TN to CA to meet up with the in-laws. We will then be traveling RT from LAX-OGG and subsequently returning to TN. I will be booking my family's tickets as multi-city with stopovers in CA before and after the RT to OGG. There are 7 people total on the trip, 4 going RT from LAX-OGG and 3 going TN-LAX/LAX-OGG-LAX/LAX-TN. No one has elite status at the moment.

My MIL was pushing to fly on Hawaiian for almost $1,000 more than AA due to the ability to reserve seats at the time of booking while AA has not yet made available all economy seats for reserving since we are not paying full-fare for the tickets. If we wanted to reserve seats together on AA for the RT LAX-OGG flight today we would have to upgrade everyone to preferred seating at a cost of $40x2x7= $560.

After reading through a few threads and piecing together information from multiple AA CSR's, here is my proposal. We will book our flights today with my family on one PNR and the in-laws on a separate PNR with identical flights for the LAX-OGG segment. We will not select any seats during booking. I plan to sign up for the AAdvantage Elite Gold Status Challenge with interim status for $300 in March of 2018 three months from the day our trip ends (maybe 2-3 days after just to be sure miles post?). Once I have elite gold status for the three month period covering the trip, I can call into AA and have both of our PNRs ""linked"" (cross-referenced according to AA CSR). This will allow my elite status to be shared by the in-laws on any flights we share. AA will then allow me to book preferred seats for all companions (including linked PNRs) for free using elite status. I believe the companions will also share in the other elite status benefits such as priority check-in, security, and boarding but I'm not banking on that.

This will save $260 guaranteed just on preferred seating and will grant me gold status through January 2019. Additionally, on June 16th I will sign my wife up for the Gold challenge with no interim status for $140 which will grant her Gold status through January 2020 since our flights will be after that date.

Thoughts?","[""(1) why do you want/need preferred seats so badly?

If so, they usually get Priority Access for free with those tickets, oddly enough."", 'Have you looked into UR transfer partners for the OGG flight?

It was recommended by multiple AA agents that we book our TN flights all the way through on one reservation and the LAX-OGG RT tickets on a separate reservation. The main reason is that booking separate tickets for the travelers from TN will not guarantee IRROPS for the connecting flights through LAX.

Those with AA elite status will see an asterisk at the top of these seats. Note that MCE, Preferred Seats and Standard seats can all be marked Elite/Full Fare. On the flight above, Preferred Seats 12E-F and 13E-F are held for Elite/Full Fare. General flyers can’t pay to reserve these seats, even if they wanted to.\n\nThe difference between seat maps can be drastic. In my opinion, there’s no justification for AA holding so many seats for elite members, except to trick novice flyers into paying for a MCE or Preferred Seat.\n\nThe good news is these seats are freed up for all flyers at check-in.

I live in mount vernon triangle area in DC and travel domestically for work.  I currently fly United and most of the time have to travel to Dulles. I started with United because Marriott gave me silver status and knew they occasionally fly out of DCA and have the United Hub in Dulles. 

I don’t mind taking an Uber to Dulles and or BWI if flights are direct and prefer that to connecting flights out of dca. I would love to find an airline that flys out of DCA more that isn’t American since my experiences with them are usually poor there. 

I have flown ~30,000 miles this year and am on track to hit United Gold. I wasn’t sure if this is worth much flying out of a hub like Dulles where it seems everyone is 1k / Platinum. 

I have a girlfriend who would benefit from the companion pass in Southwest if I could hit that and haven’t opened any of the credit cards with them either. 

So my main question is should I keep flying with United or do people living in DC prefer Southwest?","[""Personally I think chasing status is almost never worth it unless you are a true road warrior flying on the company dime. Choose each flight individually based on what schedule/cost makes the most sense.\n\nIf you get the Companion Pass through the credit cards and are going somewhere that Southwest flies it will probably almost always be Southwest when going with your companion.

I would like to use my airline specific miles before my transferable ones. Here are the balances:

**American:** ~300k
**Alaska:** 36k + Companion Pass
**Amex MR:** 225k
**Chase UR:** 205k
**Delta:** 176k (will probably get another 64k or 75k via new Delta card)
**Southwest:** 27k (won't have CP anymore but GF will probably have earned hers by then + 110k)

**Home airport:** ORD/MDW
**Length of Trip:** ~2 weeks.

Here are the countries I am interested in but don't need to go to all of them, the only one I definitely want to go to is Greece.

Countries: Greece, Morocco, Italy, Portugul, Croatia, France, Italy, Denmark

It would be nice to make it to 3 of them.

Questions:

1) I see booking one-way flights causes high taxes/fees for the return flight. Is there a way to avoid this or do I have to book RT to avoid it? I ask because I'd like to use up my Delta miles first.

2) Would spending ~3-4 days in 3 countries be a good amount of time?

3) Would using points for a ticket to the 1st country and then buying cheap flights to travel between them be the better idea?","[""I would not country hop personally.\nItaly alone has so much variety, why would you try to go to more countries?  Rome, Milan, Venice, Sicily, Naples... I just see no value in hitting Rome then flying to Denmark for 2 days or something.  You can easily do 2 weeks in France or Greece.  Just personal preference I guess but at most I'd do 2 countries.  Something like 1 week in Portugal split between Porto and Lisbon and 1 week in Croatia or Denmark maybe.  They're just so far away.  Maybe Consider Porto-Lisbon-Madrid-Barcelona or something (you'll still need to fly probably)\n\n\nAnd to your question about inter-Europe flights: yeah, that's probably what I would do.  In the example I gave up, I remember Barcelona-Madrid was like $100 one way so not bad.

In theory, you can do ORD-FCO-DBV-ATH-ORD (stay in Rome, Dubrovnik, Athens - all 3-4 days).  The inter-europe flights will all be less than 1.5 hours.

There is a trick for avoiding fees on a Delta flight: if you're leaving from North America, book roundtrip.

For example, ORD-AMS on KLM and CDG-ORD on Air France would price as a roundtrip if booked using the multi-city tool (incidentally, ORD-AMS is a great route for finding award availability with Delta points).\n\n2. No, don't do this. Travel is a lot of overhead. You'll just end up tired. 5 days per city is a good number and no real need to country hop if you pick France, Greece or Italy. If you want to do Morocco and Portugal, you can combine this with a trip to Spain (not on your list). Denmark combines well with Sweden, but is also a really great place to visit for a short trip.\n\n3. Generally speaking, get anywhere in Europe and then use European low cost carriers to travel between countries. There is usually not good value doing this with points.\n\n*Need professional help? I am a booker at Award Magic. Ask for me! :)*"", ""Agree with /u/HidingFromMyWife1, don't cram too much.

I take them out of convenience sometimes for work (since I live near DCA) but I've tended to accrue and fly more on United over the years.

I think I could potentially hit silver on United regardless of the status match, but it would require flying a bit more out of my way on a few trips and I haven't confirmed enough trips for the rest of the year to where I would definitely hit silver, so trying for a status match would make life easier.

77,Please help me find a better return from Bali for my honeymoon! ++ any hotel recs,2,92h0ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/92h0ib/please_help_me_find_a_better_return_from_bali_for/,20,1532759165.0,"Hey All,

My wife and I are planning our honeymoon for next January and just got our dates locked down, but I am having trouble finding a good return flight from DPS. I managed to get the following put on hold.

* Outbound Thursday Jan 3rd: SFO>RGN on Korean air in F with a day stopover in Seoul
*
* Return Thursday Jan 17th: DPS>SFO on Korean air in J

We would really like to to return to SFO from DPS on Friday night (18th) or Saturday (19th). I tried Cathy with no luck. Singapore airlines seems to have something maybe, but there is a waitlist tag on it. I could not figure out what that was.

We would also possibly be happy to book economy and hope that something opens up. Any thoughts about other options or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. We would like to go in J if possible.

Points

500k+ UR

500k American Airlines

I have time to get some MR if necessary


Also, we are going to stay near DPS for a few days. I have a few ritz vouchers that might work for the St Regis. Anyone have any experience staying there or other suggestions? Thanks!

Thanks!

It's our first child, and we couldn't be more excited! I've been saving up as many award points as I can to give her the ultimate babymoon. We both LOVE traveling, but are also preparing for a couple of years of more local travel once baby arrives. So we want to do one big international destination trip during her second trimester.

It looks like we are going to have a week to ten days at the end of March to travel. Our home base is LAX. My wife has expressed some interest in Greece (with a quick stopover to see family in London.) However, we are by no means committed to that destination at all.

79,W Maldives & Al Maha Report,20,b6injy,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/b6injy/w_maldives_al_maha_report/,21,1553807730.0,"

This is for a trip that I just completed last week.

My wife and I loved our trip to the Conrad Maldives last year so we decided we wanted to go back and the timing of marriott/SPG merger worked out well for us.

We booked BUF - DCA - JFK - AUH - MLE in First for 105K miles each.  Our flight from AUH - MLE ended up being downgraded to Business from First after a substantial delay due to a maintenance issue and were switched to a 2 cabin flight.  The crew was great and still treated us like first class and we were placed in the 2 front seats of the business class cabin.  Due to the switch, my wife and I eached received a voucher for $200 cash that we were able to redeem back in Abu Dhabi.  Due to delay and arriving in Male at 6 PM, we missed our seaplane so we ended up booking the Hotel Octave in Male for $97 and I would highly recommend this for a quick layover.  They provide RT airport transfer with free breakfast and the facilities are clean and get the job done.  For the layover in Abu Dhabi, I booked the Andaz Abu Dhabi using a free Hyatt certificate.

We were originally booked at the W Maldives for 5 nights but only ended up being there for 4 nights and the staff was great.  The reservation was booked under my wife's account but they honored my platinum status for free breakfast and 35% off all food and beverages.  We spent 340K Marriott points to book into an overwater villas.  The snorkeling here is fantastic and if that is what you like to do, I would highly recommend this property.  Our cost at the resort were as follows:

Seaplane transfer - $950 - $200 since we used Amex Blue Cash bonus to cover minimum spend on this. 
Snorkeling Excursion - $246
2 Shirts - $52
Food & Drinks - $420

We were able to get on the last seaplane leaving the resort and flew business class on Etihad from Male - Abu Dhabi for 27K AA miles.  The flight attendant that was assigned to my section was not very attentive and basically ignored me throughout the flight.  

We spent the night in Abu Dhabi at the Intercontental Abu Dhabi on a cash rate of $90.  The next morning we went to the Emirates Palace for ""breakfast"".  For $48, my wife got the famous Palace Cappuccino and I got the old topped ice cream cone.

We then took a cab from Abu Dhabi to Al Maha, which cost $95 before tip and $120 including tip.  We spent 2 nights at Al Maha which I found to be an all around amazing property.  The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in.  We spent 120K Marriott points and this propery is all inclusive for meals and 2 activities per day.  We did have some out of pocket cost thought which are as follows:

Spa Treatments: $356 including tip
Bar Drinks: $52
Car Service to Abu Dhabi: $200 including tip

We flew Abu Dhabi to JFK in Etihad business class for 63K AA miles and JFK to BUF on Delta for 6K miles each.

Total Miles/Points Used:

American Airlines: 390K
Marriott BonVoy: 460K
1 Free Hyatt Certificate
Delta: 12K 

The total cash outlay for this trip was just over $2800 counting taxes and fee on awards.  When you factor in the $200 bonus, $400 Etihad vouchers and each of our $300 Marriott card credits - we only spent $1600.  

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this and I would be happy to answer any questions that you have.

I am planning a backpacking trip across Europe and Asia sometime in early 2017. Things may change between now and then, but I would like to have a rough idea on what the best routes would be, airlines, and other methods of transportation. Also, what other cards I should be getting/utilizing to maximize mile/point accumulation. 


* I just got approved for the Barclays US Airways card so that should put me at 50k miles. 

* I have 10k miles with American Airlines.

* I plan on getting the Citi AA card at the end of the year, which hopefully will offer 60k miles again. 
 
* I also plan on getting the Chase Sapphire Preferred card mid 2016 to get the 40k UR points. 


My plan is currently:


* **Boston -> Iceland**
* Iceland ->England 
* England -> France, Spain, Italy, Greece
* Greece -> Morocco
* **Morocco -> Myanmar**
* Myanmar -> around Asia
* **Japan -> Boston** 


I would mainly want to use my points/miles for the routes in bold since I assume they would be the most costly. Please let me know your suggestions!

It's set to debut before March of this year, however I do not know if this kind of thing will continue into 2017.\n\nAlso, buses are the way to go when doing Asia. They may be longer, but they're extremely cheap. Read up on the different routes. Trains may be better in some cases - a bit more expensive but more comfortable/less crowded and some have beds."", ""It sounds like others have good suggestions, but you might want to consider your Boston-> Iceland itinerary using dollars instead of points.

87,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Citi TYPs,33,49tcba,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tcba/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_citi_typs/,19,1457644023.0,"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/) and my [post on getting to Europe using Chase URs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbx6/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_chase_urs/), I tried to do this overview including MRs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Citi TYPs***

Citi offers a few cards that earn ThankYou Points, including their ThankYou Premier card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for travel and gas). Citi offers a few other card options that earn TYPs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Citi’s website and check out the options.

Your TYPs will transfer to 12 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your TYPs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since Cathay Pacific operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be lower than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. FlyingBlue is definitely going to be your best option for a SkyTeam partner redemption and is a good choice in general for a coach redemption – though unless you are dead set on flying a SkyTeam partner airline, it is not going to be your best bet for a premium cabin redemption. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Garuda Indonesia**

Garuda Indonesia’s GarudaMiles program uses a distance based award chart, so your redemption cost will depend on your home airport. Garuda Indonesia is part of the SkyTeam alliance which means you can redeem your GarudaMiles for Air France, KLM, Alitalia, Delta, Czech Airlines or Garuda Indonesia (on their 5th freedom route from Amsterdam (AMS) to London (LGW)) flights.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~75k miles for coach and ~135k miles for business class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~85k miles for coach and ~150k miles for business class.

Although the redemption rates may not be horrible, the process for obtaining your award ticket is probably the worst I have ever seen. First you need to call the Garuda Indonesia call center at 021.2351.9999 to place your award ticket on hold. Then you need to download and complete an award ticket application form which you must take to a Garuda Indonesia sales office, in person, and then go back to the ticket office, in person, to claim your award ticket. So how many sales offices does Garuda Indonesia have in the US? Four. Yes, you read that right. Four. Encino, California, Chicago, Houston and New York.

In short, avoid Garuda Indonesia like the plague for award tickets unless you happen to live in or very near Encino, Chicago, Houston or New York and do not mind doing a ton of legwork.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your TYPs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Malaysia Airlines**

Malaysia Airlines’ Enrich program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Malaysia Airlines is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Enrich miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~54k miles roundtrip for coach, ~96k miles roundtrip for business class and ~132k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~72k miles roundtrip for coach, ~132k miles roundtrip for business class and ~192k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

While the redemption rates are actually generally not horrible, there have been a lot of reports of people experiencing issues when transferring their TYPs to the Enrich program. I would generally steer clear of transferring your TYPs to the Enrich program until Malaysia Airlines gets their IT department up to speed and fixes these issues.

**Qantas**

Qantas’ Frequent Flyer program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qantas is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe. Qantas also partners with Aer Lingus, so you can also fly them on a partner award ticket!

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~70k miles roundtrip for coach, 105k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~130k miles roundtrip for business class and ~190k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~84k miles roundtrip for coach, ~126k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~156k miles roundtrip for business class and ~228k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Remember that you will be charged for carrier imposed surcharges, which means avoid British Airways and Iberia flights for the trans-Atlantic segment if you can!

Qantas’ redemption costs are fairly high, so unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qantas miles that you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe as the Qantas redemptions rates are not very good.

**Qatar**

Qatar’s Qmiles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qatar is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~75k miles roundtrip for coach, ~112.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~150k miles roundtrip for business class and ~225k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip for coach, ~127.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~170k miles roundtrip for business class and ~255k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Again, and as with Qantas, unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qmiles you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe.

**EVA Air**

EVA Air is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Infinity miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 68k miles for coach, 105k miles for business class and 170k miles for first class.

EVA Air requires that you make your Star Alliance award ticket booking through their reservation office. With that said, considering that Singapore Airlines has access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that EVA Air has, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines for a coach or first class redemption. If you are looking for a business class award ticket, you are better off transferring your TYPs to EVA instead of Singapore Airlines.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Thai Airways**

Thai Airways is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Royal Orchid Plus miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 70k miles for coach, 125k miles for business class and 160k miles for first class.

Keep in mind that Thai Airways charges fuel surcharges as well on award tickets, and from all reports I have seen, they are exorbitant. Considering that Singapore Airlines and EVA should both have access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that Thai Airways has access to, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines or EVA (if you want a business class award ticket) for this redemption unless you have a huge stash of Royal Orchid Plus miles that you are looking to burn and you do not mind paying exorbitant surcharges.

**Etihad**

Although Etihad is not a part of any major airline alliance, they do have several strategic partnerships with airlines such as Air Berlin, Alitalia, Czech Airlines and Brussels Airlines. Unfortunately, you are not able to redeem your Guest Miles for award tickets on these airlines. Etihad’s Guest Miles program is a dynamic program that has so many variables in its pricing structure that I could not possibly address all the possibilities here. I would instead recommend that you go to their mileage calculator and plug in your information to determine your mileage redemption rates.

For reference though, most of your flights are going to run well over 100k miles for a coach award ticket, so I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere to transfer your TYPs for a European trip.

u/workthrowaway323 pointed out (thanks!) that you can actually book AA saver level award flights with your Guest Miles. Like AA, Etihad uses a peak/off peak system for economy award tickets. Off-peak dates between the U.S. and Europe are October 15 - May 15. Roundtrip economy redemptions will cost you 40k miles off-peak and 60k miles during peak times, while business class will cost 100k miles and first class will cost 125k miles. To redeem you have to contact the Etihad service center at 888-8ETIHAD ***at least 14 days prior to the intended date of travel***. 

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are quite good, it is important to remember that your TYPs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of TYPs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the second worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your TYPs!","[""I'm guessing no one ever mentions that you can book American Airlines saver seats with Etihad miles because no one knows about it."", ""Once again a great informational post.

ABOUT ME: I’m an Indian-American from Boston, and I have family in Southern Tamil Nadu/Thiruvananthapuram area. Since I’ve spent a lot of time there growing up, I have a deep emotional connection to Travancore and to their dogs!

The round trip would cost $1,650. 

WHAT THIS WOULD ENTAIL:
You would obtain a young street dog. The puppy should be at least 2 months old. This is the minimum age that they can be vaccinated.

Get the dog vaccinated and obtain paperwork which would allow it to getting transported on an airplane.
You should PREFERABLY buy a plane ticket using one of these airlines discussed by this article: Lufthansa, Qatar, Emirates Airline, New Zealand, and a few more. 

This could reduce the amount of headaches. To bring the puppy on the airplane, the airline company would need to know the dog’s weight, the dimensions of the container/cage, and the breed of the dog, which is a “mixed breed.”You must land in (first choice) Boston, Massachusetts, or (second choice) New York City Area.

I am listing a couple of useful tips that I have found helpful over the year. Please add something you have found helpful while booking award travel. 

1. If you can't find good flights out of your home city search from cities with international flights.  Often times programs like United show you different results based on your search city. Even if you fly out of LAX you might find a lot more availability out of Houston. Some programs like United don't allow you to ""customize"" your routing, but you can add an additional flight for the price of the flight. 

2. Look at the airline you want to fly route map. I have found J availability to Tokyo from San Jose when all the other cities ANA flies to had no availability. I found Christmas time LATAM J flights to Santiago from Orlando when there was not availability from any other city. 

3. When booking Southwest/refundable flights book them as one ways and check google flights 48-24h before your flight to see if cash fares on other airlines have decreased (I cancelled a $135 Southwest ticket for a $27 AA ticket today). Also periodically check to see of the Southwest fare has decreased. 

4. Be aware of phantom availability. Just because you see a flight as bookable online doesn't mean that the award space actually exists.
 
5. When searching for award availability be aware that all partners don't get the same award availability and use multiple sources. I was searching for Fiji availability and the easiest way to find it was with Alaska's search tool. I also used expert flyer which showed space that wasn't bookable on Alaska, but was bookable on American Airlines. 

6. Just because there are rules doesn't mean that they are always followed. I have found Singapore long haul 777er routes with partner availability, I have had AA change the arrival city of an award ticket for free, I have had AA cancel a paid ticket 48 hours after booking for free, I have been upgraded to club level access when it is specifically not allowed.

Looking for a little advice. I have 2 routings secured, just not sure which one I want to take/ I will enjoy more. This trip is for the end of March.

Route 1) BKK-FRA-YYZ-MIA with segments in Thai First, Lufthansa Business, and Air Canada Business respectively

Cost)110k MR

This ticket was caught in the Swiss Air First class debacle and it is now a fully flexible ticket. This means that I can choose to refund all the way back to the membership rewards points or upgrade to Lufthansa First without fees. My big concern is if I upgrade to LH F, Will I be able to get a flight from where I land in the US to MIA with miles and within the same day. The flight from FRA-MIA on LH is already sold out in F so no shot at that flight. So far UA has been super stingy with award space because spring break.


Route 2) BKK-NRT-DFW-FLL with segments in Japan Airline J and American F

Cost) 70k AA miles (-7k for credit card)

Its quick, its effective, it gets me where I need to go but JAL J is nothing to write home about. Apex Suite window seats are nice though.

Would love some input. What would you do?

96,Booking an award flight to Athens,3,9gxn4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9gxn4i/booking_an_award_flight_to_athens/,19,1537325696.0,"Well, it is time to book my first award flight!

&#x200B;

I did a little bit of research and decided to look for award flights to Athens.

&#x200B;

Since award flights out of IAH were not available, I decided to do some searches out of airports on the eastern side of the country. Using RR points, I will take a flight to the east coast from Houston.

&#x200B;

I do have a few questions for the more experienced individuals. Here are my searches, point costs, and questions:

&#x200B;

American Airlines

There is plenty of Business and First class availability for the date range we plan to go. 57,500 points each way via Business/First MilesAAver and 85,000 points each way via First MileSAAver.

* What is the difference between the two type of redemptions?
* Aircraft types are 744, 320, and 777 with American Airlines and British Airways. That being said, is there any preference in between the three aircraft types?
* To book, I would transfer my UR to British Avios, then call British Airways to book the flights using flight number and dates, correct? Would the point costs in ""British Avios"" be the same as the AA points I see on the AA website?
* Anything else I need to look for if booking thru AA?

&#x200B;

Alaska Airlines

* No availability, was hoping to find something with Emirates and fees with ""Partner Airlines"" were too high.

United

Some of availability, a few Business Saver Awards within the date ranges we are looking for (+/- 2 days, a little flexibility). Costs are 70,000 points each way.

* Availability are flights operated by Austrian, SWISS, and Aegan. Is there any preference or experiences within these two airlines?
* Sadly, no Lufthanasa availability.
* Any other airlines to look into within the United umbrella?
* Anything else I need to look for if booking thru United?

&#x200B;

Out of the options available, which would you pick and why?

Any other suggestions?

&#x200B;

Thank you!

You get perhaps 1 point per $ spend on a credit card, and that 1 point is worth $0.01 towards award flights.  Bang, your value is concrete and easy to calculate, and yes you can book any flight any time.  But it essentially is no better than a 1% cash back card, not counting sign-up bonuses (in fact worse, because your points can only be used on limited things like flights).\n\nWith programs that have fixed-level flight awards, awards charts and so on, you can potentially get WAY better value for your point-collecting effort.  These are the programs where people can book first-class flights from North America to Asia on Emirates and experience amazing service for very little out of pocket expense.  These flights are capacity controlled, you need to find available seats and it helps to book in advance, and it\'s hard to calculate the value for your points because it can vary widely.  If you are super-flexible you can book last minute and get some great deals too, but you can\'t *count* on last-minute bookings in any reliable way.\n\nSo, if you want to spend your effort collecting points as cheaply as you can, and then redeem for very valuable flights (long-haul, business class, etc), then fixed-level award programs are for you.  You can get phenomenal value if you are willing to work the system.\n\nIf you want to use your points as a cash substitute for ordinary travel, then fixed-level programs will probably seem limiting and frustrating.

The bad:  4 people with inflexible dates, 7/31/2020-8/9/2020 +/- a day due to work and school.  The good:  Economy is fine, redeye is fine, 1.2M AA, 800k MR, 500k DL (No UR though), fly into LIM and probably cheap cash flights to IQT and CUZ.  Best departures are PIA, BMI, STL, IND, and ORD, but positioning is possible if needed.  Here is what I have so far:

AA Miles:

Connect through MIA on AA metal or Latam metal.  Seach using QF and call to book?

Connect through DFW on AA metal

Connect through MCO, JFK, or LAX on Latam metal.  Seach using QF and call to book?

DL Miles:

Connect through ATL on DL metal

Connect through MEX on Aeromexico metal.  Search using AF/Flying Blue and call to book?

\*A transferred from MR to...ANA?  Avianca?  Aeroplan?:

Connect through IAH or EWR on UN metal

Connect through PTY on Copa metal

Connect through YYZ on AC metal

Others:

Any value in Jetblue connecting through FLL transferred from MR?

Interjet bookable with anything I have?

I have tried to research as much as possible and I hope that you guys can provide feedback on things I haven’t thought of, correct me or point me in the right direction. 

My SO and myself are planning to travel between November 2019-February 2020 and have been looking at all sorts of ways to get there. Ideally, we’d fly from ORD, but willing to fly out of another city if needed.

We will have around 700k MR, 275k UR and 450k AA (would ideally like to preserve our MR and eventually cash out via Schwab at 1.25, but not a huge deal)

Below is a list of different routes/airlines I was able to find. Again, if I have anything incorrect, or missed a possible route, please let me know!

&#x200B;

U.S. to Australia/NZ

Route: DFW-SYD

Book: Search award availability via Qantas and call AA to book

Airline: Qantas/80k AA in J One Way, 110k AA in F One Way/Nonstop

Availability: Looks like it’s not so bad (or is it tough?)

I’ve read that if there’s availability from ORD-DFW, I can ask American to add this to the ticket for no additional miles, is this correct?

Time: \~17hrs (not including connection from Chicago)

&#x200B;

Route: ORD-AUK

Book: via United

Airline: United/80k in J One Way/Non-Stop, in F/1 Connection in SFO

Availability: Seems non-existent

Time: \~19 hrs.

&#x200B;

U.S. to Asia- to Australia/NZ

Route: ORD-SYD

Book: via ANA

Notes: ANA/105k MR to 115k MR RT (have to book RT) in J / 210k MR in F (Tokyo to SYD)/ One quick connection in Tokyo

Availability: Seems to be a lot

Time: 25 Hrs.

If you went through VS, would it be 120k RT in First from ORDà Tokyo and then 70k to 80k Tokyo to SYD?

&#x200B;

Route: JFK-SIN-SYD

Book: via Singapore

Notes: Singapore Airlines/154k One way KrisFlyer in F/ 2 connections JFKàFRAàSIN—SYD. Potential of long layover in Singapore to explore city for a bit

Availability: Tough, but not impossible

Time: \~32 hours

&#x200B;

The next few routes, I’m not too sure of, so any input is appreciated!

&#x200B;

U.S.--Middle East-Australia/NZ

Route: ORD-DOH-SYD/AUK

Book: Search availability on Qantas, call AA. (When searching on Qantas, could not pull up Doha as origination city—any advice??)

Notes Qatar Airways/80k AA in J to DOH/ 70k in J (not sure if this is correct?) DOH to SYD or AUK/

Time: \~30 hrs (13 hrs ORD-DOH, DOH-AUK \~17hrs)

&#x200B;

Route: ORD-AUH-SYD

Ethiad/Apartments (is it 70k or 110k AA one way?) ORD-AUH, AUH-SYD (not sure how many AA miles?)

Notes: Book by searching on Ethiad and then calling in AA

&#x200B;

I’m not as familiar with Delta, VS or AF, so not sure if I’m missing any obvious routes from those partners?

Personally, I think the best route would be Qantas (any feedback on J v F?) and then ANA (takes a little longer through this route)

What are your experiences with Qantas F and J?

Is it as simple as finding availability on Qantas as far out as possible and then book via AA?

Did I miss an obvious route?

I am planning my 5th anniversary trip to St.Martin and was hoping to get your help!  I got a great deal on a room through Airbnb for May 13th to the 20th.   I got the Chase Sapphire Reserve and just got my bonus points and am trying to figure out the best way to book a flight.

Points available:

-Chase Ultimate Reward Points: 109,620 

-American Airline Miles: 4,425


Trip Details:

-2 passengers 

-Any class (never flown anything but economy)

-Charlotte Douglas (CLT) – Saint Martin Princess Juliana (SXM) 

-May 13th – May 20th 


I found the perfect flights through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal, but a friend of mine told me that I should ask here first to see if I can get a better deal as the round trip flights for both my wife and I will eat up pretty much all my reward points.


What I found through Chase:


-American Airlines flights AA1714 – AA868

-AA1714: May 13th non-stop Depart 7:55am – Arrive 11:35am 

-AA868: May 20th non-stop Depart 4:20pm – Arrive 8:30pm 

-Cost: 49,698 RT per person for a total of 99,396 points.


I am not 100% dedicated to these specific flights, but everything else seems to be an overnight flight with long layovers.  I need to be in SXM at the latest by 1pm on the 13th to make it to check in on time.


Should I go ahead and book these through Chase, or is there a better option?

- My wife and I (Americans) plan to go to Europe (Italy and Greece) this fall.
 
- After a few weeks in Europe, we're heading to Vietnam.

- From Vietnam, we're flying home (East Coast).

At this point, I believe Korean Air is the best option. I know **we can get two, one-way Prestige (J) tickets from Europe to Hong Kong for 125,000 (UR) points.** From Hong Kong, we'll just shell out cash to buy tickets to Hanoi or HCMC. The problem is that this involves a layover in Korea and Hong Kong, and the HK layover would likely be more than a day since we'd fly another airline and I want to play it safe.

Does anyone know of other business options that make more sense for a similar amount of points?    

**Notes:**

- We're cool with flying out of other cities in Europe; realize options out of Rome/Athens will be limited and we can just hop on a budget airline to get to a better hub.

- Possibly fitting Morocco into this itinerary as well, but would probably hit that up before Italy/Greece. Open to changing that, though, if it makes sense.

- I have 230,000 UR, which I plan to transfer to Korean. I can grab an additional 40,000 through a promo if it makes sense. Also working with 60,000 Membership Awards, and willing to grab an additional card that jives with that as an alternative.

Thanks in advance!!!

For April 20, 21, 22 you will be hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.  (Alternatively you can stay in Cusco for 2 nights on the front end, do this hike April 21, 22 and 23 and then stay for 1 night April 24 and fly out the following day for Lima.  Do this if you have concerns about altitude sickness before you start your hike) For your Machu Picchu hike you should book through a tour operator such as http://english.incapoint.com/ or https://www.camino-inca.com or http://incatrailmachupicchu.org/.  It\'ll cost about $500-600 but this will include food and a guide for a small group that you will join onto.  There will probably be small extra costs to rent a sleeping bag or walking stick.

The one you are looking for is MVC Eagle Beach, which should be around 12,200 URs per night.  This will cost you the rest of your UR balance, give or take.  If you don\'t get a few more URs to cover the whole cost, you\'ll owe a few extra dollars toward the total.  No big deal.  \n\nSo to wrap up, your points plus about $1000-1200 for additional lodging/tour expenses will get you Business/First class to and from Latin America as well as flights in economy in between, two 3 night stays in interesting cities, the famous Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu (plus a few nights in Cusco around the hike), and 4 days on the beach in Aruba.\n\nPM me if you want any additional help.

There is a first class flight leaving Orlando at 11:45 AM, via Dallas, that will get you to San Francisco at around 3:45 PM. This gives you ample time before your flight to head into the city ($8 BART ride o/w) for a few hours before your international flight. You could stretch your legs at Golden Gate Park, visit the Palace of Fine Arts (a personal favorite of mine), and still have time for a leisurely dinner at one of the many, many amazing restaurants in the city - perhaps Coqueta for tapas overlooking the ocean?\n\nYou'll leave at 12:45 AM for Bangkok, via Tokyo's Haneda airport - with your F ticket, you can access the incredible-looking Sakura lounge, and enjoy some great champagne and food during the layover.\n\nI strongly recommend that you spend a few days in Bangkok - it's one of the most compelling cities I've ever visited. With three or four nights (staying in an excellent hotel like the [Dream Bangkok](http://www.dreamhotels.com/bangkok/default-en.html) or the [Pullman King Power](http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-6323-pullman-bangkok-king-power/index.shtml) for around $100/night). With 3-4 days, you can spend some time in Yaowarat, Bangkok's Chinatown, visit the reclining Buddha and Wat Arun, take a boat down the Chao Praya, and still have plenty of time to shop and eat at Bangkok's malls and markets. \n\nAt the end of your time in Bangkok, you'll board a flight to Siem Reap. Since your stopover exceeds 24 hours, you'll be paying a cash fare of $180, bookable online through Bangkok Airways. Once you arrive in Siem Reap, you will stay at the five-star Park Hyatt - it's a truly stunning property, and the on-site restaurants and bakery are excellent (though I haven't stayed there, I can attest to the quality of the food). \n\nTo book the hotel, you will have to create an account at Hyatt.com and then transfer 37.5 Chase UR points through the portal on Chase's website. Before the transfer, call the reservations portal at 1-800-228-3360 to verify the availability of your dates for a cash + points redemption. When I last checked, availability was wide open, but YMMV. \n\nAlthough the daily rate at the PH Siem Reap is $355, you'll be staying for $100 + 7,500 points per night. Spending five nights here will be well worth your time. I'd recommend buying a week-long pass to the Angkor temple complex, although three days of touring the temples will suffice for most people. The hotel, or most travel agencies in town, will be able to set you up with a guide, and you can hire a tuktuk driver for your daily transportation needs. There's an agency across the street if the quoted prices at the PH seem outrageous - you should be able to find a great, certified guide for ~$40/day. In between your three days of touring, I highly recommend a visit to the Artisans D'Angkor workshop, a stop at Phare circus (Cirque de Soleil-like training program), and an ATV ride through the countryside. There are also programs available that can take you to more rural areas. Don't forget to leave time for the pool and a cooking lesson!\n\nYou'll have to transfer 20k UR points to your United account to cover the flight home. I'm seeing tons of availability leaving from Siem Reap, routing through Seoul and JFK, back to Orlando at the end of February and on March 1, 3, 6, and 7 depending on how long you wish to stay. Between your existing 20k United miles and the 20k transfer from UR, you'll only have to cover the $56 in taxes for the ticket. \n\nLet me know how this sounds!

I am planning an extended trip to South America from anywhere between a few months to half a year next year. My issue is not figuring out how to get to south america from the US, but what to do and what mileage/points programs to use while staying and moving around in South America. As a result,  I was wondering if anyone had any experience or could recommend what points/ mileage system works best while in a particular south american country or from going from one south american country to other (i.e. Argentina to Peru). If there are any banks points, airline miles, bus, hotel points, car rental points, etc  that would be best to stock up for now for this trip, I would really appreciate it. 
Thanks for your help! ","[""I used Avios like crazy when I was in SA last year. Flying J from LIM to EZE on 4M saved me a ton of money over a paid ticket where even economy was going for over $500 at the time. All 3 of your major alliances have a footprint in SA, so so long as you have some mileage in a few of them, you'll be good. It's highly dependent on what routes you're looking to fly though overall. I also think partner redemptions are a great way to burn DL miles if you have them. Availability tends to be decent and the pricing is usually not terrible either. \n\nAs far as hotel points, this really depends where in the country you're going. All of your majors have a footprint down there so if you're going to be in major cities, Hilton, Marriott, IHG and SPG are all good choices."", 'I second using Avios.

First time posting in this subreddit. If ""spoon feeding"" is frowned upon here, feel free to downvote me into oblivion, but I figured some of you might like the challenge of solving ""which miles should I use?"" puzzles like this.

I would like to plan a trip from SFO to South America this November. I am somewhat open to cities/destinations, but as of right now what I have in mind is SFO-GRU-GIG-LIM-CUZ-SFO. (I know I'll need some additional connections in there, especially when leaving CUZ, but those are the destinations I would like to visit.) The trip will be 2-3 weeks long. I am open to other South American destinations, especially if it involves a nicer airline (I know Korean Air, for example, has a nice F product from LAX to GRU).

I would like to fly in C or F for any leg >4 hours long. Any suggestions on which miles to use? I've been pretty good about accruing miles, not so good at using them in the best way possible (or using them at all, apparently). Here's my current inventory:

* AA: 750k
* AS: 63k
* HA: 75k
* BA: 120k
* LH: 44k
* UA: 450k

You may be able to book this by phone, however, through either AA, LAN or BA  \n4) There is probably a cheaper way do do this using Asia miles, which I have never used,  since they allow so many stopovers, which would probably just involve calling and getting a knowledgeable CSR  \n5) The dates for most of these can be tweaked at least a few days in any direction\n\nEDIT: I should also mention that I\'ve strived to do short or more comfortable legs for the options here.

You provided a great starting point. I ended up making a lot of tweaks, primarily to build in some extended layovers (e.g. checking out Panama City for 36 hours, checking out Bogota for 48 hours). The biggest things I learned about booking mileage awards in South America (for anyone who happens to stumble upon this thread):\n\n1) You can fly anywhere within South America on S.A. **business class** for 20k SQ miles; economy for only 10k SQ miles. That's half off UA mile prices for the exact same S.A. flights on CM, AV, TA, etc. Awesome sweet spot since SQ treats S. America as one zone, unlike a lot of carriers that segregate Northern S. America and Southern S. America. The only real catch is that you can't book online, and SQ's call center sucks (30+ minute hold times were not uncommon).\n\n2) With SQ, you can pay an extra $100 to have a stopover (not just layover) on a S.A. saver award. Unfortunately, you won't be able to hop all over the world on a single itinerary since SQ has somewhat strict routing rules for S.A. award redemptions. But, as an example, you can fly CUZ-LIM-GIG (which follows SQ's routing rules), then pay $100 to stay in Lima for a week, before heading on to GIG, and you'd be in business class for both segments.\n\n3) The nicest N. America to S. America flights, IMO, are on American (GRU-DFW, GRU-MIA, GRU-JFK), Korean (GRU-LAX), and TAM (LAX-LIM, GRU-JFK, etc.). (Unfortunately, Korean had an equipment change and appears to be flying an A330 instead of 777-300ER for GRU-LAX this time of year. Still better than Copa's recliner seats in business class though.)\n\n4) Copa has **incredible** award availability. I saw business class seats available on almost all flights. In many cases, four business class saver seats would be available. Combined with SQ's 20k price point for intra S. America lights, and ability pay just $100 for a stopover, SQ can really bring a lot of value.\n\n5) As always, make sure to compare mile awards to cash prices. SDU-CGH flights are on the order of $36. Even at just 4.5k Avios, it's not a good redemption. (0.008 cpm)."", ""OK, so before i start...\n\n1 person?\n\nalso give me an earliest departure-latest arrival date range\n\nalso, any status / lounge cc perks / free checked bag perks (or are you not planning on checking bags?)\n\nspecifically for the checked bag thing i'm looking at the initial sfo-lax leg, which will need to be on a separate itin from lax-gru to get F on KE"", ""awesome!

114,Seattle to Tulum booking options?,2,83x9ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/83x9ab/seattle_to_tulum_booking_options/,17,1520908225.0,"Hi all,

So I've searched around and done my research, but I'm still at a little bit of a decision making impasse.


I am planning to use credit card points to pay for most (if not all) of my upcoming honeymoon this coming September 2018.  **I have about 104k Chase UR points saved up so far.**


I have sort of jumped around to which honeymoon spots I'd like to go to (jumped from Belize, to Costa Rica, etc...), but I think I have settled on Tulum Mexico.


My question is, how should I go about booking the airfare with my UR points?

&nbsp;

From Seattle (Seatac) to Cancun International Airport, it looks like my best option is flying American Airlines (I haven't read good reviews on AeroMexico nor Volaris).  Round trip it looks to be about $560-something per person.  I do not have an American Airlines reward account yet.  In this scenario, what would be the best use of my UR points?  Should I book directly through the chase portal (for some reason I could only select economy seats through the chase portal), or should I create an AA account and then transfer my points to AA and book that way? Is there a better/cheaper way to book first class seats if I I transfer my points to a AA account?


Right now, from what I have read, there doesn't appear to be a solid ""go to"" option.  Through the chase portal it looks like I can book both our tickets for around 80k total (which for some reason translates to $660 per ticket so a lot more than just using cash).  That'll leave me some points left over to possibly apply to the hotel lodging, etc...

&#x200B;

I'm looking at an airline to commit to in order to reach elite level status. I currently live in Japan and my company pays for me to fly home once a year and I can usually do business/first class on flights home so I figured I should take advantage of this and collect miles as well as trying to reach elite level status. I plan to go home at least twice a year, maybe 3 times depending on the year. So that's at least 24k - 25k miles flown each year.

&#x200B;

That should get me to at least Delta Silver or AAdvantage Gold each year. And I also plan on applying for one of their credit cards. Whether that be AAvantage Executive or Delta Reserve to help me get extra miles and EQM. Ideally I'd want to reach a status where I could potentionally get upgrades on my personal flghts home. Does Delta Silver or AAdvantage Gold have a good shot at getting upgraded on international flights?

  
What do you guys think is the better program between the two? The one plus for American Airlines is they are partnered with Japan Airlines which I also use quite often for domestic travel around here. But it seems like Delta's Elite status is a little bit easeier to attain with a combination of the card and the flights home.

I would have liked to have planned this trip earlier, but I lost my job in May and that threw a wrench in things. I started a new job a month ago though and I was able to negotiate taking time off for the trip!

We'll be traveling from Pittsburgh and are planning on hitting Oahu, Kaui, and Maui.

I have been saving a plethora of rewards for our honeymoon, so getting there and back should be no issue, but if anyone could advise me on the best use of the points I would greatly appreciate it (any trip advice is welcomed too)!

* **American Airlines**: 109,000

* **Chase UR**: 81,000

* **Hyatt**: 2 free nights
* **Starwood**: 30,000
* **HHonors**: 77,000
* **IHG**: 19,000

* **Citi Thank You**: 50,000
* **Amex MR**: 11,000","[""Based on availability for those dates, you're going to have to use both your URs and your AA miles (and likely a good majority of both). UA has saver availability going on 2/10, but neither has saver availability coming back. AA wants 90k for Y on 2/21 returning, which means you would not have enough miles for 2. Your other option would be AA going for 40k each in Y, then UA coming back for 45k each in Y.\n\nAlternatively, if you could find availability, you could transfer 50k TYPs and 10k MRs to Flying Blue and book two RTs in Y for 45k on DL metal. With that said, I think you will hard pressed to find that space on those dates this late in the game."", ""First thing: do not do three islands on 11 days. Choose two. Maui/Kauai are best for honeymoons, leave out Oahu unless you like big city type stuff (nightlife, traffic, designer shopping, etc).\n\nAs for hotels, in Maui, don't expect much availability on points. That's a super-busy time. I'll actually be there during your dates, and the Andaz and Grand Wailea are unavailable on points, and may not open anything up. The Grand Wailea is 80K/nt, so that's totally out anyways. Up north in Kaanapali you can most likely get the Hyatt Regency, which is nice, but probably the weakest of the points hotels on the island. I think the Westin/Sheraton are 16K/nt at that time of year, so you don't have enough points for two nights. \n\nIn Kauai, the Grand Hyatt Kauai is awesome, but not great for honeymoons. Too many people like me with their brats in tow. Really, you're best off using cash for a condo somewhere like Poipu/Kapaa (Kauai), or Kaanapali/Napili/Kihei (Maui).\n\nIf you do go the points route, make sure your wife is OK with hotel hopping. Pretty sure your only option for a decently long stay is the Hyatt with your free nights and UR points. Definitely set award alerts for the Andaz Wailea though. Probably the best hotel for a honeymoon. If you're feeling adventurous, and can MS $6K pretty quick, do consider both doing the Fairmont card. No award space BS. If the Mtn View room is available (of which there are a ton of), you can get a room. You could even book it now, then apply the certs when they hit your account (pretty quickly after spend is hit). Just be aware of the cancellation/deposit rules. Fabulous all-suite hotel in Wailea.\n\n/u/aves137 has great advice for flight space. I'd add that alaskaair.com is your best bet for looking for space, as it will show nice combos of Alaska Air, AA, and Delta, that AA/Delta will not. Although I don't think you'll be able to book the Alaska/Delta combo flights with your miles options."", 'Would it make more sense to push our dates out to get a significantly ""cheaper"" (in terms to points redemption) trip?', ""Might have read this comment an hour too late, as we just booked our trip! We were able to get deals on the flights. Hotel wise, we don't mind hoping. We're doing two nights at the Grant Hyatt Kauai, I'll be sure to wave to you and your kids. We're not really good at relaxing on vacation, we like to do as much as possible, haha. We'll be there for 14 days now, should be enough to tackle parts of 3 islands.\n\nWhich Fairmont card are you referencing? \n\nThanks for the tips and advice!"", ""If your dates are flexible, then I would say that depends on how much you value your points. If you travel/spend/churn a lot and can replenish your stockpiles rather quickly, then I'd say go for the dates that work best for you. If you do not travel/spend/churn a lot and put a high value on the points that you do have, then I would say it makes sense to push your dates out for a better redemption window.\n\nAlso, I would consider changing up your destination a bit. Hawaii/the South Pacific is one of the hottest areas for award travel for honeymoons/vacations. If you two have your heart set on Hawaii, then by all means, run with it. The islands are awesome for sure so I totally get it. But consider that for 5k UA miles less you could fly one way to/from SE Asia in Y, and burn all of your AA miles on a J redemption on CX for the first/second leg of the trip. If you're looking for beaches and tropical, check out Phuket or Koh Samui in Thailand. "", ""You can probably do 3 if you have two weeks.\n\nIf you're out exploring Kauai (and you should be), the Hyatt is a waste. But if you're going for some R&amp;R there, it's fabulous. You should email the GM and/or social media rep and tell them it's your honeymoon and ask if you can be placed somewhere nice and quiet. I can give you the email. If you ask for the Poipu wing it's far from the lobby and the pools, but closer to the water.\n\nAnd we'll actually be on Maui, at the Fairmont and Sheraton (but hoping for the Andaz to open up). Here's [a link to the Fairmont card](http://www.fairmont.com/promo/card/). If you're a risk-taker, also look into the Wyndham card for Koloa landing. Killer deal on a luxury 1BR condo in Poipu, if there's space.\n\nAnd if you use SPG points, do note that you can call in and pay 1500-2500 extra to book directly into an ocean view room.\n\nI could go on for hours about Hawaii. PM me if you have any questions."", ""Our dates can be flexible, our idea was just to get away when it's cold here in Pittsburgh.\n\nWe are set on Hawaii though, we know it's a bit of a cliche and more expensive, but it's also a place we would both like to visit and cross off our bucket list.\n\nI appreciate your advice though!\n\n"", ""I'm also from PGH and my wife and I honeymooned in Hawaii. It's a must see and if I could give you some advice in Maui. Spend a whole day on the Road to Hana. When you get to Hana....keep going!

It's absolutely stunning! Enjoy your trip...so worth it."", 'Totally understandable (and I was in no way insulting your selection so I hope it did not come across as such). AA and UA both allow you to do a calendar view for when there is saver availability. I would start looking at different dates on both of those calendars to see what you can make work for fewer miles. My first post only takes into account the dates you had in your original posting. For example, if you wanted to go 2/28 through 3/7, there is saver availability for both departing and returning on AA which would set you back 70k miles total for both tickets RT. You should be able to island hop for ~5k AA miles each one-way, so your stash should be more than enough to get you both to Hawaii and then to a few different island. That would also leave your URs to be transferred to a hotel chain like Hyatt for redemption somewhere.', ""Sounds awesome, we'll be sure to check it out!"", ""Wasn't insulting at all, no worries!\n\nI'm on the site now and I just saw those same dates, looks like there are a few options for leaving in late January as well.

There was a post on here not too long ago asking about Hawaii hotels as I recall that had some really good information on it. I would do a quick search for that to start."", ""Also, one last thought on miles. You could transfer 50k URs to KE and redeem those for two Y tickets RT. I would recommend calling KE to see if they have the availability before transferring the miles. Also be prepared to jump through some hoops to use your miles for your SO as KE is weird about letting you book flights for others (i.e., only your immediate family). You will also need to fill out a form and send that in before they will ticket your award. The flights would be on DL metal. For the pain it is with KE and for how easy it is to replenish AA miles, I would say you're better off saving your URs for hotel redemptions or another trip, though that's a true YMMV situation that only you can make a decision on."", ""On 3/7, Delta has OGG-ATL-PIT available.

124,Trip Report: Rome and Madrid (with biz class flights on IB and TK),20,7va1qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7va1qy/trip_report_rome_and_madrid_with_biz_class/,17,1517811138.0,"Posted this in the r/churning weekly thread but re-posting here for a bit more visibility for anyone interested

Recently came back from a 2 week tripe through Europe. Visited Rome and Madrid with the wife, and then went to Romania by myself. Reviews of flights, accommodations and lounges below. All booked with points except the AirBnb. 

**ORD Terminal 3 Oneworld Flagship lounge**: Having visited the pretty terrible Terminal 5 BA lounge when I flew CX to Asia, I was not expecting much. This lounge blew me away both in the options available - the high end gourmet food (the lamb chops and the pumpkin risotto were fantastic!), the desserts (I loved the truffles and the cheesecake bites) and the premium quality alcohol (I had the champagne) and in the fact that it was way less crowded than most other Flagship lounges I have been to. 

**ORD-MAD Iberia Business Class (Honeymoon seat)**: Bottom line: this flight is perfectly fine and a great way to get to Europe with AA miles and only $100 in fees one way. If you are traveling alone, you will want to avoid the honeymoon seat.  

Details: Iberia operates a fully lie flat 1-2-1 cabin configuration where everyone gets direct aisle access. The middle seats alternate between more private rows and rows where you lack any privacy from the person next to you (you are closer than in economy as there is no armrest between you) - the honeymoon seats. My wife and I flew in these and loved it. We watched a movie together and cuddled. However, if you are flying without a companion, you will have want to avoid these. The seat itself was ok - it was fully lie flat but not very comfortable as the pieces didn't bind together seamlessly. I hardly slept at all. The food, drinks and entertainment were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. I made it to Madrid in decent shape.

**Madrid Terminal 4 Iberia Flagship Lounge**: this was pretty bad as far as flagship lounges go. Standard snacks (pastries, some prepackaged pasta and stuff) but there was an espresso maker (Illy) that gave a decent cappuccino. They also did not seem to have enough cleaning staff so most tables had trash from customers who had left. 

**MAD-FCO Iberia Business Class**: Bottom Line: Terrible, but that was expected

Details: Basically on this 2.5 hour flight we got an economy class seat (this is standard for Intra-Europe biz class) where Iberia had blocked off the middle seat in a 3-3 configuration. We got a breakfast that was better than the overnight long-haul flight (which was weird). I was so tired that I slept for an hour. 

**Rome: Boscolo Exedra Roma**: Bottom line: good use of Marriott points especially in high season. Great location. Hard bed. Prepare for a shitty ""room upgrade"" and a mediocre breakfast with Marriott status. You will be charged a 5 Euro/person/night occupancy tax upon checkout. 

Details: I had scored a 5-night Marriott travel package a while ago and paid some extra points to upgrade those to be used for a category 9 property. I booked the Boscolo (basic room), although the value wasn't great as it was low season. Upon arrival, I was told that I was upgraded to a Superior room with a view of the street (Marriott Gold) but when I got there I saw I had a view of the back of the hotel, not the beautiful Piazza with the fountain on the front (for that you need to have your room upgraded two categories to a Deluxe room). The room itself was the most beautiful hotel room I've seen in a while: super high ceilings (must have been at least 12 feet or more), marble floor and walls in the bathroom, and furnishings made out of a combination of marble, cast iron and beautifully worked oak. Technology was hilariously outdated with a tiny TV, no USB chargers by the nightstands etc. The biggest issue was the bed: our ""King"" bed was actually two twin mattresses put together and covered with one set of bedding, and they were super hard to boot (an Italian thing apparently). Upon asking they put an extra mattress pad for padding which made it a little better. The included breakfast (with status) was very extensive but pretty bad by both American and European standards, as Italians don't really eat breakfast. They had 4 types of cakes (including birthday-style chocolate cake) - who does that for breakfast??? The coffee was surprisingly bad. Location was excellent: 5 min walk from Termini train station (to get to the airport) and while there we walked everywhere except Vatican, where we took the subway from right in front of the hotel. Rome itself is beautiful with all the statues and well-preserved architecture, but I would not go again. Stuff is fairly expensive, and restaurants close at random times and on random days of the week. Most places take credit cards, but only Visa or MC. 

**FCO-MAD Iberia Economy Class** (booked on the UR portal): This flight was pretty bad. First of all, unlike what the Chase agent said, there was no included checked bag, so we had to pay 30 euros for our two bags. On board, water was free but we had to pay for a sandwich (8 Euros, pretty bad). Otherwise pretty standard. 

**Madrid**: We had three nights in Madrid. The ""standard"" points redemption is the Westin Palace, which is maybe worth it if you want to visit the Prado museum (because of its location) and in the summer where prices are high. I opted for an AirBnb at 70 euros per night which was plenty large and comfortable. Madrid was nice, much more affordable and Rome and more pleasant to hang out in even though there aren't that many ""sights"" to see. It is also much more affordable. A little note: I went to an amazing Flamenco show at Corral de la Moreria, which costs 50 euros/person. I could have booked on the UR portal (same price) but had read that people with third-party reservations get worse seats so I paid cash. When we got there, we got THE WORST table anyway (behind a pole), but we got moved to a great table 10 minutes in for unclear reasons. So probably best to book on the UR portal and save the cash? 

**Madrid Terminal 1 VIP Cebeles Priority Pass Lounge**: This lounge was a pleasant surprise. Very spacious and well arranged, and very well stocked with solid snacks. In addition to pastries, there were Spanish meats, cheeses etc. Good alcohol selection and decent coffee. This lounge costs 30 Euros per day if you do not have a Priority Pass, and it might be worth it for a long layover. 

**MAD-OTP (Romania) TAROM Economy Flight**: The Romanian national airline TAROM is still one of the most solid in Europe. I got a free checked bag, a sandwich and dessert on the flight for free, and they were offering free soft drinks and alcoholic drinks. The person in front of me had a Romanian wine called Feteasca Regala from a very good producer, which is one of the country's top shelf wines. I was surprised they would give that on the plane. 

No points redemptions in Romania on this trip. You should check out Romania's Transylvania region if you are in that part of the world. It's beautiful, not too touristy, and still affordable. 

**Bucharest OTP Business Class lounge**- they used to only have one lounge in Bucharest for everyone not flying TAROM, but now they added another one and it's pretty bad. I was flying Turkish airlines, and had a lounge directly above my gate. Lounge had pretzels, potato chips, yogurt, soft drinks, white wine (Romania does not really produce red) and a mediocre coffee machine. Still, it was nice to sit there in the quiet, as I was the only one there. 

**OTP-IST Turkish Airlines Business Class**: I kid you not, this may be the best short haul flight in the world. TK operates a fully lie-flat seat in a 2-2-2 configuration on this 45 minute flight. The business cabin can seat up to 30, but it is almost always mostly empty. There were 3 passengers and 3 flight attendants in the cabin, including a very nice Turkish girl who taught me what's up with Turkish Coffee. They start the service with a welcome drink of juice, then coffee (Turkish or western), then full breakfast, then another round of coffee or brandy. That's a lot for a 45 minute flight! Bonus: unlike most flights out of OTP that allow you to catch a connection to the US, this flight does not leave at the crack of dawn but instead leaves at a reasonable 10 am.

**Istanbul Turkish Airlines Flagship Lounge**: I have been to this lounge a few times and continue to believe this is the nicest airline lounge in the world. Sadly, I didn't get to experience it fully. I had a 3 hour layover, but being a foreign national on a one-way ticket flying through the middle east I got branded with the SSSS list (apparently everyone does coming out of IST) so I just went to security to get intimate with the TSA agent. In all screenings took about 15 minutes only as I was able to bypass all lines with my J boarding pass. 

**IST-ORD Turkish Airlines Business class**: I[ have reviewed this flight before so will not rehash](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4ke6jf/trip_review_hong_kong_bali_transylvania_and/), except to say that this is a great way to fly out of Eastern Europe and is now even better than it used to be. This flight allows you to have a full 12 hour of long-haul biz class, as opposed to transiting through Western Europe where you have 2-3 hours of ""business"" class and then 6-8 hours of true long haul business. The only problem is that the cabin is 2-3-2, so if you don't pick your seat in advance you might get a middle seat! The fact that you can redeem Aeroplan miles on TK with no fuel surcharges has made this the go-to for my family and myself for years now. Since I flew last time, they had improved the headphones (nicest noise cancelling headphones I have ever experienced, even nicer than my Bose ones).

I was looking it over and am struggling to see if fulfiling the challenge is even worth it. The elite status only goes as far as Jan 31 2019. so doesn't that mean I would have tos pend more to keep my elite status?

Anyone with experience in these challenges or is aware if this is a good oppurtunity or not? ","[""There are many sites out there put a dollar value for each tier in each airline / hotel. You can check for yourself and see if the benefit fits into your own travel pattern. The best time to sign up for a challenge is when you're starting new, with no status with a particular airline or hotel, and for whatever reason you know you'll be using a lot more of their services in the coming months / years. That's the best time for a challenge as you can benefit a lot quicker from the reduced requirement.\n\nFor example, you start with nothing with AA, and a new work project means you'll be flying 80k miles with them in the next 12 months. If you follow the regular path, only by the end of the 12 months, you'll make Platinum Pro. (Assuming you make the EQD as well.)\n\nInstead, sign up for the challenge at the start, as soon as you hit 20K miles in first 3 months. Congrat, you're now Platinum Pro, and you can start enjoying the benefits. (Again assuming you'll hit the reduced requirement of EQD as well).\n\nChallenges are really a great way to kick start a travelling career. Get you all the status you deserve right at the start."", '[deleted]', ""If I recall correctly there is a date in June (30th?) after which status challenges give status through the next calendar year. Maybe hold off before taking on a challenge. There's info somewhere in the FlyerTalk forums.\n\nIt does look like you at least get some 500 mile upgrades out of it. Those may not help much - I hear they don't always clear anyway, and they seem to be only good on domestic flights.\n\nIs the difference between what you would spend on flights during the challenge period normally and what you would have to spend to hit the EQM and EQD goals worth a few extra RDM free bags and early boarding?"", ""I think I've done two challenges and came close to making one. It's nice not having to pay for the premium seats and having priority if you have luggage checked.

I ended up taking AA up on a similar offer a few years back and managed to extend my status the following year as well, but reflecting back I can honestly say the benefit we’re barely noticeable.

So back in November, my fiancee and I got engaged in Hawaii. I had booked this entire 8 day trip with points and actually surprised her by telling her we were going to Cancun Mexico. I would never have been able to make such a memorable trip without the help of everyone here in /r/awardtravel and /r/churning. Here is my detailed redemption report. https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/5bslgz/trip_report_weekly_thread_week_of_november_08_2016/d9r4ii0/

Now I am in need of your help again. We are planning our wedding for June 2018. I want to give us enough time to travel 3-5 weeks before she has to go back to school and teach at the end of August. I am having a tough time deciding the countries, where to fly into, the route, all that stuff.

**Destination: Southeast Asia.**

So, my question to you, what countries would you visit within a 3-5 week span? Would you prefer J or F on the way there or on the way home? Finally, would you start in the North (i.e. Seoul) and move your way South through HKG, Vietnam and Thailand or take a different route? 

I understand certain travelers have preferences as far as what they like (i.e. beaches, hiking, food), but in reality, my fiancee has ZERO international travel experience so anything is a go. 

Here is the points break down along with projected/pending/hopeful points.



Points | Points (Me) | Pending/Project/Hopeful Points | Points (Her) | Pending/Project/Hopeful Points
------|-----------|------------------------------|------------|------------------------------
UR | 117,862 | Chase Business | 107,277 | CSP for 50k + 10k for my referral and 5k AU
MR | 78,626 | If I could get the Amex Plat 100k :( | WIP (Work in Progress) | WIP
Southwest RR | ~80,000 | Referrals, Annual points | WIP | WIP
Hilton HHonors | 80,816 | Referrals, Surpass | WIP | WIP
Hyatt Gold Pass | 9,806 | Nothing with Program changes | 10,000 | Already have Chase Hyatt
Delta Skymiles | 66,160 | Referrals | WIP | WIP
IHG | 23,269 | Currently working on Accelerate for 41k | WIP | WIP
American Airlines | 41,842 | AA Plat for 50k (approved 1/16/2017) | WIP | WIP
SPG | 33,762 | SPG Biz if possible | WIP | WIP

We will be flying out of MSP. I know flights out of MSP may be limited as far as what we can get for J and F to SE Asia, so I have been scouting out J and F out of SFO, LAX, JFK, SEA and others.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Table formatting is being stupid. If it helps, total projected UR after CSP min spend will be ~300k. Total projected IHG after Accelerate should be ~65-70k. Total projected AA should be ~100k.

EDIT #2: I'm not too worried about using points for every single detail of the trip. I understand cash may be better for flights between countries or hotels/AirBnb/hostels. I am going to assume we will pay cash for those from the wedding (asking for wedding donations to fund our travel addiction (mostly mine) instead of gifts).","[""TBH I would say don't go to SE Asia at that time of year (and it is my favorite destination). At the time of year it's a miserable swamp and there's usually increased pollution due to burning. If that's the destination, go on honeymoon in November when it's optimal weather and just before the holiday high season."", ""If you're considering Korea as part of SE asia, then I think you should consider if you want to spend part/no time in bigger cities.  Places like tokyo/seoul/taipei/HK/bangkok could easily take up the entire trip.\n\nI agree with jello sweaters in that, you should ease your way into the cultures. "", ""Since your wife has 0 International travel experience, I also recommend /u/jello_sweaters advice of going in descending order of Westernness. \n\nThat being said, I'll make things harder for you to decide and propose an opposite route of starting in Singapore and working your way up to Hong Kong befoee flying back. \n\nSIN is an English speaking country and a very metropolitan city. It'll be a good start to being in a place where everyone can and does speak languages you don't understand and that is culturally diverse, but still easy to travel within. \n\nPersonally, I would recommend you stay only a couple days in SIN and then give longer chunks of time to other places like Vietnam (Hanoi/Sapa specifically) and Myanmar (Inle Lake, Bagan) (my own personal favorites) and do shorter spurts (3-4 days) at places like KL, Bangkok, Sieam Reap, Bali, HK, etc. Assuming you literally take the above (5 destinations x 3 days ea plus 2 weeks for the others), that's already 4 weeks so it'll all depend on how you and your fiancee travel and whether you want more time in less places or vice versa. The above are just some general destinations (didn't mention Korea simce I don't consider it to be part of SE Asia) but there's tons of other spots to hit up too that I haven't mentioned, so it'll be up to you guys to research and see what interests you the most. Sorry I can't offer much advice on the actual award bookings, though! \n\n\nGood luck and congratulations  in advance! \n\nAlso, make sure you guys research which countries will require visas on arrival, and which countries will require visas to be applied for and approved before entering the country. As an American, I applied for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar in advance but my friend told me you can get a VOA in Vietnam. Indonesia has a VOA. Thailand and Malaysia don't require visas.

Situation: Booked a JAL coach class award from NRT - BOS for my mom over a month ago, with the plan to upgrade to business if/when a J class seat opened up. Used American miles as I wanted to preserved Alaskan miles.

Observation: The award availability when checking on the British Airways site and the Alaska site was pretty consistent. Only coach availability until about 2-3 days before the flight.

I then saw availability for J on the same flight on the Alaska website and then called American Airlines to upgrade. They could not see the award inventory. I thought i just had an incompetent CSR but then I checked the British Airway site and lo and behold, there was no J availability.

What I did: I ended up booking the business class seat through the Alaska website and it ticketed no problem. I then canceled the coach seat via American. What’s curious is that there is still some inconsistency. Another J seat popped up on the Alaska site for the same flight but is not showing up on BA.

We do not MS. I probably can't get the full 100k Avios from the current offer without MS, but if I open an LRCU account I can easily get 50k + 25k = 75k avios.

Note 1: we have the SW companion pass via my wife's account through 12/16. So no sense going for more SW points right now, we'll focus on that late next year to re-up our CP.

Note 2: Neither of us is eligible for CSP thanks to new rules. Original plan was to get 2 of those. Wife had it once 3 years ago. I have Ink+ Biz card and earn 1200 points monthly from auto billpay to cable/phone companies.

Note 3: I am not getting the current United 50k targeted offer, only the 30k offer.	

Note 4: Wife got 50k Amex MR bonus in 2014, converted points to BA Avios during 1.4x redemption, card is cancelled. Neither of us have had the Amex platinum.

Note 5: We do not MS. I am open to the idea of the $15k LRCU account hack, though.

Note 6: FICO 812, income is good.

**My trip desires**

My wife is a teacher and I have decent vacation time. We'd like to do 3-4 weeks somewhere we haven't been before that won't break the bank with food/hotels. Ideal destinations include Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Budapest, all of Asia, India, all of Africa (esp S. Africa), all of Australia/NZ. Flexible travel dates late July/August 2016. Asia is probably highest on the list for both of us, but we're open.

It would be fun to move around a bit during the trip, but neither of us love flying so we mostly want to have one long travel day coming and going and minimize flying around once we're there. 1-2 additional flight days max during the trip. It would be fun to travel in business or first but we're not going to kill ourselves getting points to upgrade. 

I've never been to London and would be open to 3-4 days there even though it's an expensive city. But I'd rather not pay their enormous taxes on ""free"" flights.

Not interested in anywhere US, Canada, Caribbean, Latin America, or Eastern Europe for this trip - we want to go somewhere new :)

Home airport is Boston, easy enough to get to JFK via JetBlue points if necessary.

**Card thoughts**

Wife and I can probably swing one more card each this fall, depending on minimum spend. Then we can probably do another card each in the winter. So we want to put those cards towards points so we can redeem them early. In the winter we can probably each do another card, probably go for hotel cards at that point. Might go for a third set of cards next spring, again with hotel cards.

My original plan was to load up on Chase UR points by getting each of us a CSP. But that plan is now ruined thanks to the 5/24 rule.

I was then going to go for United points by going for the Chase United cards, but the 50k deals seem to have vanished except for business cards - I have a biz card via Ink, not sure if I can get the United biz card or not.

Looks like I missed the 100k Amex Platinum deal (I was on vacation using my SW companion pass, so I won't complain too much!).

Am still keeping my fingers crossed that the 140k RC offer comes back so we can do a fly + stay redemption.

I have zero use for airport lounge access, fee reimbursements, or most other perks. All I want is points.

**Questions**

Given my limited options to get more AA points, get Chase UR points via CSP, or get a decent stockpile of United miles, it seems like I should focus on BA. But I have never heard anything good about Avios except short haul (we don't want short haul for this trip) and have never had great experiences with their website. And since flying F or J on BA is now ludicrously expensive via points AND has huge surcharges on BA metal via London, I'm hesitant to go all in on Avios. So...

* Should I transfer my MR points to BA before the devaluation on 10/1?
* Should I go for the current BA card offer, recognizing that I don't MS and this might present an opportunity cost if some other better offer comes up?
* Are there other offers I'm missing that will help us have a truly memorable trip?
* If I do go all-in on Avios, is there some amazing routing/destination that will maximize my fun with Avios? I really don't care too much where we go next summer as long as it's new to us and beautiful.
* If I decide not to pursue Avios as a strategy, what's should I do instead?

Thanks!","['As you said, for long haul travel, especially in J or F to Asia, Avios are near useless.\n110k AA miles RT CX J is by far the best deal to SE Asia , so I would pick up the 75k offer on the Citi executive giving you nearly 210k AA and almost  enough for 2 round trips to most places in Asia ', ""Avios can be very valuable for repositioning flights once you get to the continent of your destination. Since you're looking to go to Asia for 3-4 weeks, I think it's safe to assume you're going to be hopping around a bit. Avios become incredibly valuable in that scenario, especially if you're looking to fly J/F. For example, I'm flying HND-HKG and then later on HKG-SIN for 11k Avios each + ~$140. The flights are in J and would have cost me around $4,500 had I actually paid for them.\n\nAre Avios good for long haul flights? Well, that depends on what you consider to be good value. CX for example flies BOS-HKG direct. J tickets on AA will cost you 55k miles and F tickets will set you back 67.5k miles. Using Avios, that same flight will set you back 150k + $52 in taxes/fees in J and 200k + $52 in taxes/fees in F. Clearly the better deal is using AA miles, but if you can't get extra AA miles, then Avios may still be a worthwhile proposition. Alternatively, if you used your CP to get yourself out to LA, the cost of Avios goes down to 105k for J and 140k for F. \n\nIf it was me, my strategy would be building up enough AA points for CX/JL flights to and from Asia, and then stockpile Avios to use for the connecting flights getting you to a bunch of different cities."", ""If you decide to do Europe the Avios could be useful there. Boston-Dublin on Aer Lingus using Avios is one of the best redemptions in the whole system. It's also an unusually short transatlantic flight. Once in Dublin you can use Avios for a cheap trip into London.\n\nThe key will be to fly back to Dublin or on to somewhere like Spain before flying back to the US. The exit taxes for the UK depend on how far away you're flying and in what class, so doing an economy flight to a nearby country and booking a separate nice flight from there is minimizes the crazy UK taxes."", ""For UA, try logging into united.com, click on the 30k card ad, click on 'are you a business owner', click on 'not a business owner'."", ""If I were you, I would choose the most affordable option when it goes to flights and transfer. Look for the cheapest tickets available. I don't think that it will influence your flight a lot, but you will save a lot of money. Also, book your transfers from services like http://kiwitaxi.com/Thailand/Bangkok+City I used it for travelling in Thailand last summer, and it helped me. I hope that I was helpful for you :)"", 'Is that the card with the $450 AF?', ""Interesting, I hadn't thought of the AA Executive but $450 to get that many AA points would be worthwhile in this case."", 'Good ideas, thanks!', ""Yeah, I've been looking at some of these itineraries.

140,Biz Class Award / Upgrade flights to Australia (LAX-SYD) - lets discuss,3,56cbjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/56cbjs/biz_class_award_upgrade_flights_to_australia/,15,1475887531.0,"I've spent a lot of time pouring over data and monitoring flight availability from LAX-SYD, especially on American Airlines (AA).  My findings so far:

AA
----
All during the summer and until mid sept, confirmable upgrade space on AA was readily available 1-3 days out.  It would typically appear 3 days out, and you'd have 7/7 U/C (upgrade or SAAVER biz class) seats available.  

This worked great, as long as you could be a bit flexible, but I was able to get upgraded 5/6 tries.  My strategy was to book a refundable ticket for the day I wanted, and if it became available, upgrade for only 15k miles (instead of $350+25k for discount economy).   This usually cost ~ the same and earned 1.5 EQM.

If availability didn't happen, I simply moved the date and paid the difference.  I was 2/3 with this move.

This changed mid-late sept though, and 7/7 has become 0/0.  This is frustrating and an unwelcome surprise, as it now appears that AA is releasing zero confirm-able upgrade space.  I should be exec-plat next year, but I may be traveling with (3) companions and I'm unsure of how many you can upgrade with you (paid upgrades).

UNITED
----
United typically had award flights available sporadically 1-2 months out, available for 70k miles.  This too now is gone.

DELTA
----
Occaisionally I'd find the 80k flights but I spent way less time on this one.

I am a frequent traveler. For many years I just booked the lowest ticket, but started using loyalty programs about 3 years ago. 
At 1st they were great. Hit Silver on Delta, then Gold. Perks were good + free upgrades from time to time. Then Something went wrong and they were not only unwilling to help, but took every advantage to screw me over. 
Note: This is where I actually thought the 'loyalty' part was suppose to help out.

I believe in 'voting with your dollars' so I switched airlines. To Alaska. It's great, love it... but it doesn't fly many of the place I had to go... so switched again 

This time to American. Hit gold for the 3rd time and something when wrong again (showed up 43 minutes early for a flight, apparently this cost me $1200 on a flight that only cost me $1100 originally)

I emailed but haven't heard anything back in a week.

So 'voting with your dollars' again. My 1st question is if there is a international airline that does help out when you have a problem. As I said before, I love Alaska and had good experiences with southwest in the past. But neither have enough routes or anything international. 

Should I find a new program or just go back to flight by flight booking?

EDIT 1: Thanks for all the advice. My take-aways are

* Gold status doesn't help at all
* Unless you are going to get to diamond you might as well just get the best/cheapest flight possible and forget about a FFP (frequent flyer program)
* Most people feel it natural to be abused by airlines

For one way, it is 40k direct for economy, and 80k for business saver. However, all the business saver flights fly to somewhere first on first class, and then to Sydney on economy. Like come on. One ticket LITERALLY had a first class ticket to Vegas (a 50 minute flight so basically pointless), and then from Las Vegas to Sydney on Economy...for 80k points one way. Whereas just going from LA to Syd on economy would be 40k. Like do you really think i'm gonna fall for that? I'm sure any layperson who has no knowledge of award booking is gonna fall for that thinking they are flying business class the whole way through...because the ""mixed ticket"" warning is nonexistent (unlike on United where it warns you).

UA uses a more robust algorithm that requires the transatlantic/pacific flight to be in the premium cabin. ', 'Does the same thing on TATL flights. Really have to watch carefully.\n\nCould be fixed on their end with a fairly simple “TATL / TATP leg must be >= business class”. Greed, or laziness... hmm.', 'I totally agree. I\'ve been looking high and low at AA awards to the Middle East next year. 99.9% of the time the award bookings are either on BA which will charge like $600 each way for a business award plus the miles. So imagine 150,000 points plus like $1,200 then they will also mix in non-business segments and extra connection so you end up with something like ICT-(First)-ORD-(First)-LGA (change airports) JFK-economy-LHR-(fake business(middle seat blocked) on BA)-TLV all sold as a ""First"" or ""Business"" route. What has even been worse is that you can\'t trust searching by segment if you want to book online. So you might see a business seat on the non-stop Hub to Hub long haul but when you search for it as a connection the business seats go away. You can call it bad IT or whatever but I think it\'s a combination of too much demand for too little seats combined with AA\'s push to release more economy seats on long haul routes so they can report back about how they have made many more award seats available. Not to mention that off-peak awards have gone from 60k RT under US Air to 115k RT post-merger on TATL routes. \n\nSo to answer your question. AA thinks you are smart enough to search and find ""Business"" awards but too stupid to move your loyalty to another airline or notice that the long haul is ""economy"" or mixed cabin. I\'m surprised these don\'t book into basic economy with no seat selection or bags. Alaska also has this problem with mixed cabins but at least they put the little seat of death on the search results page and they are also at the mercy of BA and AA award availability on many routes. Alaska need to offer Iceland Saga awards and up their Condor offerings to Europe I think. ', 'I understand that Business or First is not available on all flights. However, don\'t say that there is an 80k business saver flight from LAX to Sydney, and then when you look at the details, it\'s actually a first flight ticket to San Diego, with an economy flight to Sydney. Like just say ""no business/first available from LA to Sydney,"" rather than trying to trick you with mixed flight bs. When you try to book a flight, there is no option on the first page to search for a nonstop flight.

It's a boon for AA and it's certainly not being done by mistake."", '90% of the time or more this will be all that shows up for J to Australia...', ""It's not necessarily a bad thing. I have seen airlines that won't show premium cabins unless they're available on all legs of the itinerary - so you can't book anything in PY with a US domestic connection, for example."", 'They could make their system more robust if they wanted to.  Obviously they don\'t use they same logic for revenue booking and we saw when they had a ""glitch"" and allowed expanded OW partner bookings for a day.  ', ""I agree with your mindset on this but I also know how screwed up AA is and it's a perfect storm of factors (in my opinion). \n\n1. Not wanting to give away premium seats to loyal customers (or hackers)\n\n 2. Poor agreements with partners like BA that rip people off with YQ not to mention the stupid UK PSC on premium seats \n\n3. Too many people that generate too many miles too easily that want premium seats (demand)\n\n4. Poor IT and back office management\n\n5. Nickle and dime attitude of C level management\n\nWe could go on but I doubt they care. I hate all the award issues but when you make the award searching harder it makes it very time consuming to find any premium awards on popular routes.

144,"Trip Report- American Airlines Economy, Charlotte to Dublin",21,4jlxlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4jlxlf/trip_report_american_airlines_economy_charlotte/,15,1463444544.0,"I live in Nashville, and just got married on May 1st. For our honeymoon we wanted to go to Ireland. This trip was my first real redemption. Charlotte is a ~7 hour drive from Nashville and we have some friends there, and the best flight availability sourced from there, so that's where we decided to fly out of. We both have issues with getting enough time off from work, so getting a direct flight was important.

Our flight left CLT Thursday 5/5 at 6PM, got into Dublin around 6AM. The two economy MileSaaver round trip off peak to Europe booked pre-deval cost us 40,000 AA miles each. We got these from AA platinum cards. Direct to Dublin cost about $100 in taxes and fees and whatnot for both of us. I have the Prestige so we were able to go to the Admirals lounge in CLT- it was only the second lounge I've ever been in, so I don't have much to compare it to, but the soup was good and the hummus and cheese and snacks and stuff were good. Pretty crowded though, and the view was bad. There's another AA lounge in CLT that I did not get to check out. Though I don't recall which one we went to. 

So I don't know what kind of plane we were on (apparently a Airbus A330-200, thanks /u/the_fit_hit_the_shan), but it seemed big (to me. This was my first flight to Europe- I'm sure other planes are way bigger). It had 2 seats on both ends and 4 seats in the middle, so 8 total across. We got free beer/wine and 2 decent meals. The plane had a lot of good recent movies to watch for free- Deadpool, Concussion, Hateful 8, Spectre. I was impressed. The seats were bigger than I'm used to but sleeping in economy is still pretty tough. 

We landed at like 6AM, customs were mercifully short and painless. We booked a rental car through Kayak for $5 a day, a tiny Renault with a manual transmission. The car rental lot is directly connected to DUB, so we didn't have to take a shuttle or anything. We paid for the car with the CSP for the primary coverage. I contacted Chase before the trip and got them to mail us an official letter stating that we had insurance coverage in Ireland. The employee at the car rental company did take and read this letter, so make sure to get it. 

We drove from DUB down to the Hilton Kilmainham, which is on the other side of Dublin. Driving through Dublin traffic on an hour of sleep is nothing short of a nightmare. Driving on the left side of the road (for the first time) is pretty tough, and shifting with my left hand took some mental recalibration. 

But we got to the Hilton at 8 AM, and it took them about an hour to get our room ready. Given that check in isn't till like 2, I was pleased with this outcome. We told them we were on our honeymoon, and they upgraded us to a Deluxe on the top floor, and they gave us a free bottle of wine and a bunch of very nice chocolate. I am also a HHonors Diamond member. I travel for work and we usually stay at Hamptons. So to me, this hotel was super fancy. I'm sure it's nothing compared to a Conrad or Waldorf, but this is the first time I've stayed at a true Hilton, and I thought it was awesome. Great service, modern room, beautiful view from the balcony. And it was only 30k points! Totally awesome redemption. And it came with free breakfast for both of us. The buffet was pretty good, but we also got to order omelettes. The buffet included honeycomb, which I've never had before. Like straight up honeycomb taken out of a beehive. You chomp on it. Delicious. I highly recommend this hotel. 

It's in a good location too, as it is across the street from a famous prison, Kilmainham, and all of the tour buses stop directly in front of the hotel. We got 2 tickets for the ""CitySightseeing Dublin"" bus tour for like 17 euros each. All of the bus tour companies run the same routes so it doesn't really matter which one you take. But we were pleased with the content of the tour and all the sights it took us to see. 

The hotel is also like a mile from the Guinness Storehouse, which is a decent tour, but not worth the money IMO. But I'm not really that into beer brewing information. So take that for what it's worth. The view at the top is pretty cool, but it is PACKED. Though the beer is delicious, I couldn't really tell a difference in the taste at the Guiness storehouse compared to any other pub in ireland. I don't know if I should have expected a difference. 

We ate and hung out in Dublin for the day (Friday), and on Saturday we drove out to Kilkenny. Really neat town, we saw the Kilkenny Castle (7 euros) which was cool and worth the money. We went to the Rock of Cashel in Cashel, which was 7 euros also, and is an absolute must see. It's the old ruins of this castle way up on a hill with an astounding view and tons of history. Definitely go see this. We stayed in Airbnb's paid for with the Capital One Venture for most of the trip, because there are no Hilton or IHG properties outside of Dublin. 

We went to Kinsale and visited the Charles Fort, which was awesome. Kinsale is a great town, lots of small fun shops and pretty architecture. 

We went to Dingle, which was an amazing town on the southwest tip of Ireland. Very beautiful, there's a ~50 mile drive you can take along the peninsula with breathtaking oceanic views and cliffs and stuff. Dingle is famous for having great traditional Irish music in their pubs. Accordians and all that. It was a great time.

We went up to the Cliffs of Moher, which is also an absolute must see. Amazing breathtaking cliffs with absolutely no protective barriers. It's very windy and people die up there. If you recall the ""Cliffs of Insanity"" from the princess bride, that was filmed here. Amazing views and tons of walking you can do up and down the coast.

We ended up in Galway, which is a great city. It's beautiful, lots of shops and restaurants, history, hustle and bustle. I don't have anything specific to say but it was an awesome city and probably my favorite city we went to. 

Our final evening we returned to Dublin and stayed at the Crowne Plaza (IHG) Blanchardstown, which is like 20 minutes from Dublin city center. It was a pretty nice hotel, we got a bunch of free beer down at the bar when we told them we were on our honeymoon, and the hotel gave us two free drink vouchers. Breakfast was not included, which was disappointing. This hotel was 30,000 IHG points. 

We returned the car in the morning, and it had some damage in the passenger side mirror. IDK how anyone can drive in Ireland without damaging the car. The roads are super narrow, very windy, and everyone drives fast. A lot of the roads are right up against trees and bushes and walls and stuff. Drive carefully.

Our flight back to Charlotte was supposed to leave at 10 AM friday, so we got there early and went to the lounge. It's operated by the Dublin Airport, so it's not an Admirals lounge. My prestige would not get us into the lounge, but the prestige provides the Priority Pass, which did get us in. The food was light but it was good, some really tasty parfaits and croissants. Nothing hearty. There was some liquor to drink but no beer. We didn't get to hang there for long because Ireland has a ""US Pre-clearance"" customs thing. You go through customs in the Dublin airport instead of going through customs back in the states. So you go through normal security to get into the Dublin airport. You walk around and go to restaurants/the lounge and whatever. But then instead of going to your gate, you go through another security thing where you scan your bag and take off your shoes and everything. And then fill out customs forms and take your picture and talk to the customs agent. So it adds an extra 45-60 minutes on this end, but when we arrived in Charlotte, we walked right off the plane no trouble. It was like a domestic flight when we arrived. 

We got on the plane, and there was a 3 hour delay because of maintenance stuff. It happens. We watched a bunch of movies, got free beer, and got pretty decent hot food on the way back. 

Saturday night, I was able to find a Best Rate Guarantee with Holiday Inn in Asheville, so we stayed for free at the Holiday Inn Asheville Biltmore east. The hotel sucked, was old, the breakfast sucked. BRG's are possible but this is the only one I've ever found after quite a bit of searching, so don't ever count on finding one. Also don't stay at that hotel. Paid rates were like $200 for that night. Garbage deal.

To recap the award redemptions for 2 people-

**Flights**- 40,000 AA miles each for economy CLT-DUB=80,000 total. I got a 50k AA platinum card and my wife got a 50k AA platinum card.

**Lodging**- 1 night at Hilton in Dublin, 30,000 Hilton points. 1 night at IHG in Dublin, 30,000 IHG points. 5 nights in Airbnb's, coming out to almost exactly the $460 signup bonus with minimum spend on the Capital One Venture. 

**Car?**- Paid $35 on the CSP, got the insurance for free. Insurance would have been a lot more than $35. We got a tiny stick shift, that's why it was so cheap.

We spent like $900 while we were there on food, tours, gas, gifts, souvenirs, etc. I'm very pleased with what we spent. At the time we were there, the Euro was about $1.20, so everything was a bit more expensive. 

Notes about Ireland- there is no tipping in restaurants. But the food is more expensive to make up for it. Unfortunately the service sucks everywhere because they don't count on tips. So be prepared for service to suck. They also don't bring you the check in restaurants. You have to ask for it. Nobody speaks Gaelic. But oddly, all street signs are written in Gaelic first, then english below it. 

We picked Ireland because there were direct flights for 40k miles from an airport we wanted to use, and we built the honeymoon around that. So you have to be flexible. This was a pretty spazzy and unorganized post, but do with it what you will. ","["">So I don't know what kind of plane we were on, but it seemed big (to me.

***

My brother and his wife are going on a trip and are willing to use my miles if it's a good value for me and gives them some amount of discount. I'm all for it as long as there is enough value in the discount price for me to use the points/miles.

Here's the breakdown. They want to go Seattle to Santiago Chile around the 6th/7th of December. Then on the way back they want to go from Buenos Aires to Seattle, around the 24th or 25th.

There are some great tickets on the way down. Delta, United, American Airlines all have ~30k miles + $5-$10 flights. 

On the way back there are less options and more expensive (presumably due to Christmas). 

Here are the flights on the way down:

* American Airlines one way to Santigo: 30,000 miles + $5.60
* United Airlines one way to Santiago: 30,000 miles + $5.60
* Delta Airlines one way to Santiago: 35,000 + $5.60
* Same Delta booked through Air France: 29,000 miles + $10

For returns, American Airlines is the best bet. All of these have high fees (about $90 compared to $5.60 on the way down). Looks like coming in the opposite direction has some other taxes and fees.

* United has 70k + ~$90 and really long 2-stop flights. They're an expensive currency compared to others, and long stops, so not good. 
* Delta has 100k + ~$90. This is the one mile type I don't have a lot of, and can't transfer from other points (at least not economically), so this puts it out of contention entirely.
* American has 55k + ~$90 on the 24th or 75k + ~$90 on the 25th, with one stop. I have 500k of these and they're easy to acquire more of, so this is good in all respects.

***

I sent them all of the above. I then told them:

So really your first choice is: miles or dollars. I think it needs to be all miles or all dollars. One-ways with dollars are expensive, as you saw, so doing one with dollars and one with miles won't work. Either you need to pay for the whole thing with money, or do miles both directions. 

Assuming miles:

Decide what to take on the way down. Mostly they're the same so whatever times you like more and/or whatever miles I want to use up the most.

Basically only realistic option on the way back is American Airlines, deciding whether to goon the 24th or 25th (55 or 75k miles). 

Here's two specific itineraries just to price match. Using American Airlines so that $ and miles are compared on the same exact route.

American Airlines to Santiago, coming back from BA on the 24th: 85,000 miles + $96.81. Google flights has this for $2402. https://goo.gl/flights/tUoA4 14-15 hours on the way down, 17-19 hours on the way back.

American Airlines to Santiago, coming back from BA on the 25th: 105,000 miles + $96.81. Same $2402 on Google flights. That means it's less valuable (mile wise) because more miles for same cash price. But, one extra day. 

If you were to do cash, Air Canada is cheapest at $1623 but on the way back it's 28-hour 2-stop flights. United is $2193 with 15 hours on the way there and 18 hours on the way back. So if you're going to do miles, closest comparison is United $2193 and American Airlines $2402.

Rough math:
Let's say you do the 105000 (30k+75k) miles with both ways on American Airlines and come back on the 24th from Buenos Aires. That's $90 ish in fees, $100 to make it easy for rough calculations. So 105000 miles gets you 2402-100=2302 of flight value. Obviously if you were doing cash you'd be going for United. $2193 would get you back $98 of value as points per person (3% and then 1.5 cents each value, so 4.5%). So anything more than $98 off the price is ""valuable"" to you in that scenario, though $99 off probably isn't worth it.

*** 

**Ok, context done**

So how much is ""fair"" (""fare"", even) in this case? If they paid me $1700 per person that would be $1600 (after paying fees) for 105,000 AA miles which is just over 1.5 cents each. I know they're worth more for various aspirational flights but I'm not taking those, so I shouldn't benchmark against that. Is 1.5 for normal travel good for that? Or should I do something like $1900 (so $1800 after paying fees)?

Small side-note: I have some AA gift cards which would work perfectly for paying these fees if we do this. They each have a reserve, if I paid the fees with $1 on each of their Reserves and the rest on GC they'd still get protection benefits, right? Even if it's miles? As long as the Reserve is used for at least once cent to pay for the booking it's good?

Would really appreciate help with this! They're fine with whatever number. I want to be fair to them (ie not offering just $10 off what they could get with cash, for example) but I also don't want to lose ""too much"" in point value. Thoughts?","['This sounds like an absolute mess. It also sounds like they’re going to get gouged either way. There’s no way I’d pay $1600+ for non business tickets to Chile.

Hawaii options are good, but if you want the Andaz Maui there aren't many points-bookable rooms, so make sure to be really on top of that.  If you're flexible on exact country and island, though, Hyatt has some great tropical and/or island properties--I might start by looking at the Park Hyatts in the Maldives and St. Kitts.\n\n4) If your UR points are going to the resort, though, you'll likely be too short on miles to do first class, especially round trip for two people.  If that's important to you, you might be able to look into buying coach and upgrading to business class (you can sometimes do that with American miles on closer destinations for 15k per one-way ticket...you'd have JUST enough miles for two round trip upgrades, but availability and finding affordable upgrade-able base tickets might be hard)."", 'You are the best!

156,Where should we go? Italy? Caribbean??,6,2xxdgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/2xxdgt/where_should_we_go_italy_caribbean/,14,1425519376.0,"After a year+ of not getting any vacation time from work (and therefore not getting any vacation longer than a 3 days weekend), my husband has a week off at the end of August. 

I'd like to take him somewhere outside the US, since he's never been outside the country, but I'm open to suggestions based on a few things.

1. timeline - we have to leave on a Saturday or Sunday and return on a Saturday or Sunday
2. location - ideally we'll go somewhere warm/beachy but are open to suggestions
3. award availability/cost - see below

Our flight needs to be on Southwest or American (and/or any airline that can be booked with American points), out of BWI/PHL/NYC. 

- I've almost got the companion pass for Southwest (within the next month), so points aren't an issue if we go to the Caribbean. 
- For American, after the US merger I'll have 117k in my account and 50k in my husband's account. We are ok with economy overseas but don't want to pay crazy fuel surcharges (i.e. the airline has to be AA, Aer Lingus, or Air Berlin). If we're short a few thousand points I can get those in a month or so.

Our hotel/lodging is TBD. We are ok with staying a few nights in different places with different chains if it keeps the cost very low, and for any nights we can't cover with points I'll probably use Airbnb. I have (or will have in a month or two):

- 10k SPG (plus another 25k that will post in a few months)
- 35k Club Carlson (plus another 5 or 10k within the next few months, and good for city-hopping since 2nd night would be free)

Any suggestions of what would be a reasonable one week trip? 

One thought is to go to the Caribbean (Costa Rica, Aruba, Punta Cana, Cancun, etc). It'll be easier to be in the same time zone, but the flights are anywhere from 4-6 hours, which isn't much savings over going to Europe. Plus we might have to deal with hurricanes and his work isn't flexible if we get stranded.

The other thought I had was to do Italy (I've done a good amount of traveling in Europe with friends, but have been saving Italy specifically to do with my husband). Spend time in Rome, Venice, etc, sightseeing and enjoying the culture. I can see pretty good award availability to/from JFK for about $75/person in fees, so this is definitely a possibility.

I personally would pick Italy. That's just my own preference though! Club Carlson is great because you get the second night free. And you get 5 points per dollar on the card, so if you shifted all of your spending to the card between now and then (or just got a second Carlson card, for whichever one of you doesn't already have one), you could probably get enough points to cover a second pair of nights. Unfortunately they only have 3 properties in Italy (Rome, Milan, and an oddly located resort near Padua/Venice).\n\nAs far as alternate trip ideas: a Scandinavia trip sounds interesting, especially during the summer. For a week, you should probably pick any 3 of these: Stockholm, Copenhagen, Oslo, Bergen, Helsinki.

157,"Moving to Dallas, Any Reason to Switch from Chase to Amex?",6,5h0ni3,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5h0ni3/moving_to_dallas_any_reason_to_switch_from_chase/,14,1481155079.0,"Hi Everyone,

I'm moving to Dallas and am wondering if this will have any effect on what credit card I use. I'm relatively new to the points game, but so far have been loyal to SPG/Alaska Airlines and use the Chase trifecta for general spending. 

Dallas is an American Airlines/Southwest hub. I will occasionally travel for work and our company makes us use the Amex Green, sadly. I do have the option to essentially buy those points back by paying the annual fee for the card, which most people have told me is a good idea since they generally spend more than what the fee is.

That said, is there any advantage to switching to Membership Rewards from Chase now that I'm in Dallas? Neither is an American Airlines partner, the CSR gives me Southwest points if I want them, and Hyatt alone is much more viable as a transfer than the hotel partners that Amex gives.

The question really becomes if Amex's air partners are better for me given that I'll be flying DFW/AA a lot. For example, Amex has partnerships with Cathay, Emirates, Etihad, etc. Are there sweet spots in those charts, for example, that I could use? 

My goal for award travel is to either fly for free domestically in economy, use points to upgrade to business class for international flights, and have free or cheaper (through the cash + points option) hotels. I don't particularly care for staying in fancy hotels or for flying business even on transcontinental domestic flights.

If anyone has advice on the best CC strategy for someone in my position, that would be great.

Thanks!","['AmEx Platinum for the Centurion Lounge @ DFW.', ""British Airways has nice short-haul charts, so point for chase there, as it is a partner. \n\nYou could get the AA card, which will give you free checked bag(s). \n\nBut if you're looking for just free economy flights and cheaper hotels-well, I'd go with Citi Double cash, to be honest. the annual fees really eat at the premium cards (though no int'l transaction fee and some of the travel insurance is nice). Most domestic flights will cost 25K. You'd win with Citi double cash if the ticket is less than $500.\n\nAnd hotwire/priceline-well, they certainly give nice discounts but you'll need to pay cash."", 'Maybe SPG?', 'Why not both?  Point diversity is a good thing.', ""Amex and its partnerships with CX, EK, and EY are significantly less useful than continuing with your CSR for transfers to Avios for AA Y redemptions and WN for WN redemptions.  Additionally, I'd keep crediting your actual AA flights in many cases to AS, and open an AS BofA card if possible, as you can easily use AS miles to fly on EK out of DFW as well."", ""Not worth it. It'll take you at least 10 minutes to get from that lounge to your gate, which is most likely either a or c if you are flying domestically.

It\'s really hard to figure out how useful AAdvantage miles are, since all I see online is people complaining about their switching from distance to revenue-based rewards. I think Citi AAdvantage still has some of the trip insurance, etc., so do you know much about sweet spots with the AAdvantage reward chart and is it useful for flying OneWorld alliance partners as well?\n', ""Going to echo /u/iopeneverydoor here: I would stick with Chase. \n\nNot sure if you're aware, but you can book AA flights through British Airways for as little as 7500 Avios one-way. Since DFW is basically smack in the middle of the US, almost every domestic flight falls under this 7500pt category (with the exception of the airports on the West and East Coasts; see http://wandr.me/award-search/avios-map/)\n\nYou can also redeem some short-haul flights from AA directly for just 7500, but there are more options at 7500 if you book through BA. I've also heard that booking through BA gets you priority boarding on AA flights, though this might not be the case any more.\n\nChase UR points transfer to BA Avios at a 1:1 ratio. The Amex MR to Avios transfer ratio is less than 1:1 (forget the exact value), so Chase has the upper hand in your situation."", ""I have the Amex SPG card, but I'm going to product change it because Amex has worse customer service than Chase, it's less accepted than Visa, and it doesn't have any major insurance benefits (i.e. trip cancellation, etc.). I don't really see the point in keeping it, especially since my beloved SPG points are going to become crappy Marriott ones soon."", ""They reimbursed you‽ Damn. Amex wouldn't do that for me even though I booked with my plat. "", ""If you'll be flying AA and lounge access is at all of interest, you might think about making that one premium card the AAdvantage Executive card. While it earns neither MR nor UR, it does get you into Admiral's Clubs domestically.\n\nYou should be aware that American has not had the best award availability lately. It is true that Amex offers more American partners than Chase, but most of these partners will only be able to see the same limited award space. British Airways will be your best bet for 90% of flights in the US, and they partner with both Amex and Chase, so that's a wash. The only reason to switch to Amex would be if their category bonuses/your work spend meant you would earn substantially more points, or if you think the flexibility of booking through multiple programs is important.\n\nPoints diversity is never a bad thing, so maybe picking up one good MR card to go along with your work card but keeping your Chase trifecta will be the best bet. Say the Everyday Preferred, and just use that for groceries while you'd use Chase for other stuff like dining or travel."", ""I didn't think you could PC that card??\n"", ""> I don't really see the point in keeping it, especially since my beloved SPG points are going to become crappy Marriott ones soon.\n\nStill not a bad card for everyday, non-bonus, spending, since 1 SPG -> 1.25 AA with the transfer bonus."", ""I'm not sure. They said that if I call next month, once my card has hit the required threshold, they'll give me a list of options to change to. Hopefully they allow me to PC to a no-fee card.

After traveling 150k miles a year for the past decade, I've learned a thing or two about maximizing rewards for travel savings. Today I'd like to share some basic advice on the differences between transferable and fixed value points. This will make it easier to fully enjoy the world of award travel and choose the right credit cards for your own needs.

Let's get to it!


---


#Transferable Points


---


Let’s begin with transferable points. There are a few transferable points travel-focused programs available. They include Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Points, American Express Membership Rewards, and Marriott Rewards points. All of these programs allow you to earn points and then transfer them to partner travel programs (though Marriott Rewards is a bit more complex than the other three).


This gives you the opportunity to purchase exactly what you want with your rewards. You can earn and collect your points until you are ready to redeem them from the many options available. 


If you’re a traveler who values flexibility, transferable points are awesome. You can use your points for that future bucket list trip. Don't worry about staying loyal to a particular hotel or airline. You can also travel when you want—whether it’s peak season or not.


Once you earn points with these programs, you can use your travel portal (ex. Chase Ultimate Rewards) to redeem your points directly. Or you can take advantage of the opportunity to transfer them over to a hotel or airline partner. You’ll want to consider the redemption value to decide which is the best move.


This can be a great way to take an international trip in a business class seat. If you’re used to flying economy, this can be an exciting and rewarding experience to save up for. Be sure to look at partner transfer options to get a feel for the best redemption based on your own travel goals.


---


#Fixed Value Points


---


Next up are fixed value points. Fixed value points programs offer a fixed or set rate. No matter how you plan to travel or where you plan to go, you can expect the same point value. That means no complicated awards chart or guessing on your end.


If you like to keep things simple, this may be a good points system for you. It’s also a great option if you plan to spend on miscellaneous travel purchases that aren’t part of a traditional partner transfer program—like Airbnb, rental cars, and cheaper accommodation options. This is also a great choice if you need to travel during peak times and have no flexibility with your schedule.


Many travelers choose to use this option to book more affordable airfare, such as coach seats. It tends to not be a good choice if you want to travel business class or stay at super fancy hotels. In addition, it can be a great choice if you want to travel domestically as it’s generally cheaper for a domestic flight.


With fixed value points, you won’t have to worry about the point system changing unexpectedly. Instead, you know exactly what you’re getting now and later.

Now that you have a better grasp of the differences between both point options, you may be wondering which is the best. While one points type isn’t always better than the other, you can use your own goals and travel preferences to help decide which option will work best for you at the time. It’s different for everyone!

If you want to maximize your perks, want to be in control over your full travel plans and schedule, and you’re not loyal to the same travel brands, transferable points may work well for you.

If you want to travel during peak season, tend to book more affordable airfare or hotel options, and want to keep things as simple as possible, fixed value points may work well for you.
Or, if you're open to keeping track of more than one credit card, it could even make sense to have some of each!

Be sure to consider the type of points that are being offered when you start applying for a new rewards credit card. You want a card that works for you. If you are interested in comparing some of the top travel credit cards available, I published a 2018 review on Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnyjet/2018/06/03/best-travel-credit-cards-of-2018

167,Some Spring Break Help!,1,7du4yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7du4yi/some_spring_break_help/,13,1511053308.0,"Hey guys! This is my first time redeeming points. I've done a bit of research but I want to double check to see what you guys think. I have two spring break trips planned. One in March with my family to Barcelona and one in April with my girlfriend with the long haul to London, then some shorter flights to neighboring countries. I'll be flying out of Dallas while my gf is flying out of LA.

My point balances:

* Alaska Airlines - 6k
* American Airlines - 14k
* Delta Miles - 9k
* Some points in Norwegian, SW, Spirit, and United
* MR - 110k
* UR - 266k
* HHonors - 21k

I'm looking to fly economy for the family trip, then 2 business+ for trip with the gf. I'm also hoping to spend as little money as possible for these two trips (I want to use my points!). I also have some HHonors points so if anyone knows any good Hilton hotels :P.

For the Barcelona trips, according to Award Hacker it looks like my best bet is finding a Delta flight and booking through Korean or Air France for about 60k points? It seems I can also do AA economy for 30k each way.

Then for the London trip it looks like same deal, book with Korean for 80K miles for business?

*I'm also a bit unsure how to book these flights. Do I look up flights in Delta, then contact Korean to see how many points? Then transfer the UR or MR points then call them again to book? Would the amount of points change?

170,How to Book Etihad with American Airlines,11,7v4vw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7v4vw9/how_to_book_etihad_with_american_airlines/,13,1517750221.0,"Many of American Airlines partners you cannot book online.  Etihad is one of those partners that cannot be booked online.  You can search for award availability directly with Etihad.  I find the chrome extension that /u/enraged_ewok mentioned, https://award.flights/ incredibly helpful in searching multiple days at once and only showing availability that is open to partners (in theory).

Booking Etihad can be more difficult than booking other partners that cannot be booked online because not all agents can see all of their award availability (especially business and first class).  I read that the AA agents in Fiji have a different computer system that can see award availability and that you can reach these agents by calling the New Zealand or Australia call center.  It turns out that the call center in Fiji is now closed (according to FT).  

One thing that gets complicated with calling a call center is that you never know what call center you will get routed to.  Asking agents doesn't always get you get where they are located since some contracted agents are required to lie about where they are always located.  The following information is based off of multiple reservations and assumes the reps are telling the truth about where they are located. I used Google Hangouts to call the overseas numbers, Skype is also a good option.


**USA call centers**, 800-433-7300, can see some* Etihad award availability.  It seems they can see a lot of availability to/from ORD, but in general have issues if the flights touch the US.



**Australia (Brisbane) call center**, +65 02-9101-1948, frequently calls are forwarded to the Trinidad center, agents can frequently see all award availability, sometimes can see it, but not book it



**New Zealand call center**, +64 09-308-4014, results the same as Australia, no agents based in New Zealand.



**Trinidad call center**, can see same space as US based call centers



**Singapore call center**, +65 6349-8444, never actually talked to anyone based there, but they typically forward to Peru



**Peru call center**, +51 0-800-40350, their system seems to be slower than other call centers (frequently apologize about how slow), everyone I talked to had who talked to them reported them being able to see and book award availability. **This is my preferred call center**

&#x200B;

I have decided to go to Hawaii for my honeymoon in June 2019 and I'm having trouble deciding how to use the points I currently have. This is my first time redeeming rewards on a bigger basis and I would be extremely grateful if you can help me with some advice!

&#x200B;

**Where I am fly to and from**

I can fly from PHL, JFK, or EWR and I plan to fly to Maui OGG airport or Honolulu HNL. From what I've seen on AAdvantage, round trip tickets are about 50,000 points. If that's the case, I'm still short 30,000 AA points so perhaps it's possible to transfer my other points to AA? Also, I think Citi allows points transfer to certain airlines (not AA), but those airlines supposedly fly through American. I'm not exactly sure how that works so would it be better to just use Citi points?

&#x200B;

**What I have**

**American Express** \- 60,000 points

**Capital One** \- 100,000 points

**Citi** \- 120,000 points

**American Airlines** \- 80,000 points and $200 worth of American Airlines gift card. 

&#x200B;

How do you guys think I should use my points towards hotel, if that's even possible? I've never booked a hotel with points before so I'm not sure what's the commonly redeemed hotels in Hawaii. Again, I would really appreciate any tips!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","[' if United Airlines has flights that work for you,  Citi points can transfer to singapore airlines, which is a star alliance partner with United.\n Singapore charges 35,000 points per person for flights from continental US to hawaii round trip in economy.  \n\n I took my family of 4 to hawaii last year by transferring my UR points to singapore airlines and booking a united flight through them, it was way cheaper than booking directly with united.', ""I just booked a ticket for my wife and I to Kona, Hawaii from NYC  (LGA) using AA miles so I might be able to direct you based on my experience. There was no saver level award going there for my specific dates so I had to pony up 50k per person getting to Kona but only 20k for the return since there was saver award availability. I don't know what your time frame is but I'm seeing saver level awards for 45k round trip all the way until June (June 11th-June 19th as an example itinerary from JFK to Honolulu). I tried what one of the other readers suggested by calling Singapore Airlines to try to lock down a 35k round trip. Even though United showed saver level awards, the Singapore agent said there was no availability which I found weird. Perhaps the second leg of the journey being flown by Hawaiian may have been the reason why but I can't say for certain. But definitely give that a shot.  As far as hotels, Citi and Capital One don't transfer into any hotel program so if you were going to use those points for a hotel stay, you would be using it at a fixed value of 1 point = 1 cent.  AMEX transfers to Marriott/SPG at 1:1 and Choice Hotels at 1:1.  Marriott properties go for about 50k per night and Choice's ascend collection go for 30k a night. AMEX transfers to Hilton at 2:1 and their properties in Hawaii cost at least 40k per night so assuming you transferred all your points into Hilton, you'd get 3 free nights at one of their mid-level properties. Honestly, transferring into any of the hotel programs is not the best use of AMEX points if you want to stretch your points to get you the most value and you might just be better off using Capital One at a fixed ratio where 100k points can get you $1k worth of hotel stay.

I'm in a situation where I'm basically going to be booking for \~10 people to fly from SFO-HKG, all on the same plane. For this route though, there seem to be a million options and partners, and I'm kind of overwhelmed. It seems to be a pretty common flight so there are so many posts talking about their individual methods.

Currently, though, I'm having a hard time beating the Chase UR portal rate (1.5cpp): $548/passenger and 36.5K/passenger (Cathay Pacific) I see a ton of transfer portal options at around \~60K roundtrip, but not a better deal that I can find.

&#x200B;

**Requirements:**

\- SFO - HKG (nonstop) roundtrip

\- Prioritize price; economy is fine, unless there's a super good deal for not much more

\- all on same flight

\- Dates are flexible around either Nov 7th (but not earlier in the week) or Nov 14th (same) for about 3 weeks

**Point Inventory:**

\- About 800K UR

\- About 200K MR

\- 60K JB (lol)

\- 60K American (lol)

\- Definitely willing to use cash too if we don't have enough points

&#x200B;

Additionally, are there any bulk options to consider? I've seen some airlines like Delta have portals to enter for bulk pricing; if we can get a discount for having so many people, that'd be great too. On the other hand, the UR portal and Google flights only limit to 6 or 9 passengers / itinerary on the online portals. Is the only way to guarantee being on the same plane to book twice right after each other quickly? Also, am I violating any terms by using points to book for a group?

Round Trip

Class of service? As good as we can get, but we can probably get an upgrade because of platinum status, so booking economy is all right

Dates desired? September 3-8, with a little room a day on either side to wiggle, depending on timing and which airport we're using.

Chase Sapphire: 67,000 points and adding

Hilton points: 270,000

Or am I spreading myself too thin for next year. My family flies American exclusively.","[""I would credit your flights to AA until the revenue based system takes effect in June or July so you can maximize your mileage earning on AA while you still can. For the remainder of the year I would credit your AA flights to AS. A few reasons for this - 1) you're able to redeem AS miles for AA flights; 2) AS offers more bang for your buck with their award charts post-AA deval; 3) If you happen to end up on any AS or DL flights after you earn status (assuming you don't opt in for a status match), you'll be eligible for complimentary upgrades on those flights as well; and 4) once you hit mid-tier and above status, you'll earn bonus RDMs for your flights, which can be quite valuable.\n\nThis is my strategy for this year as I'll hit EXP myself in the next month and hold AS MVP Gold status as well. I don't clear upgrades on DL very often, but I'm 100% on AS upgrades. "", ""Silver status mostly sucks, and has no real benefits. Fees drop slightly, but not enough to warrant roughing it. \n\nPersonally I'd use the exec platinum status, unless you have some specific plans for travel coming up that you need that status.

DL even with status match seems like a bit of a tangent given my family won't be switching anytime soon. \n\n"", ""DL is revenue based as well and there are limited sweet spots in the award redemptions, so you're definitely better off opting to run for status with AS. Besides, both DL and AA flights will credit to AS (though most Y DL flights only credit at 50%), so you really open up your flight options."", 'So just to see if I understood properly: \n\n* Fly AA marketed flights the entire year \n* Status match with Alaska (should be able to get MVP Gold 75k)\n* After the revenue based system takes effect, start crediting AA flights to AS \n* If I end up on AS or DL-marketed flights for whatever reason, I can try and opt in for a complimentary upgrade\n\nIs that the gist of it?\n', ""Yes, that's the gist of it.

AS also allows you to buy a slightly more expensive ticket that allows you to confirm your upgrade at the time of purchasing the flight. Sometimes the cost difference is huge and other times it's like $25.\n\nFor DL flights, you'll need to include your AS FF# when you book (or after, but definitely before checking in) and you'll get added to the upgrade list automatically. Your upgrade will clear after all DL elites (including the lowly Silvers), so unless you're on a very empty flight or happen to be on a route that lacks elites (family vacation destination or small regional airport usually), your upgrade is unlikely to clear in my experience."", ""Perfect, this is what I'm going to do.

When you make your FF program the same as the competition who offer a better on time reliability and customer service (DL) and who have made actual steps to improving the experience to win back flyers (UA), and when flights on both of those programs are exponentially less expensive, you've lost my loyalty entirely. \n\nI will still fly AA when they fit, but from here on out it is whoever gives me the least expensive ticket."", ""And to think I JUST qualified for Exec Plat for the first time...man.

My parents are both Exec Plat's and used to clearing upgrades out of ORD, SFO, and AUS on a regular basis. Which airline do you think would give them the better chance at a similar experience should they status match? DL and UA upgrades are both done by status and then fair class and then dollars spent right?\n\n* Are first class award tickets more/less expensive/available for DL and UA? We fly the grandmas from Greece once or twice per year so we need to make sure there's a pool of miles available.

Like the title says, I recently got a promotion at work (yay!) and it will involve a lot of travel. Specifically I'll be traveling Monday-Thursday from Dallas to a minor East coast city. This travel schedule will most likely keep up through the end of the year, and next year they could place me on projects anywhere else in the country. I had a travel role my first year out of college and was really on top of my points and rewards programs. Here are my current rewards programs and what I have saved up:

Southwest Rapid Rewards: 35k points

American Airlines AAdvantage: 4.6k miles

Hertz Gold Plus Rewards: President's Circle w/ 500 points (Status matched from National after my company stopped using National)

Hilton HHonors: Blue Level 120k points

Chase Ultimate Rewards: 225K points (Worth 1.5x more when redeemed for travel.)

I used to travel a lot, but I've pretty much lost status with all the rewards programs outside of Hertz. My preference in the past was Southwest Airlines, but my goal is to save up points for international travel, which Southwest unfortunately doesn't offer at this time. I have done some research and decided that I want to switch over to American Airlines. Dallas is a major hub and I can get nonstop flights to almost every city from here. I want to understand what I can do to maximize my experience and points with American Airlines. 

For those wondering about credit cards, I have 4 accounts currently open:

Capital One Journey Card (Got this in college to build credit Dec 2016) Limit: $1800

Chase Sapphire Reserve (Jan. 2018) Limit: $26k

Chase Freedom Unlimited (July 2018) Limit: $11k

Chase Freedom (May 2019) Limit: $7k 

I have never missed a payment and have always paid my balance in full outside of a few stressful months in college and when I took a major vacation with my family. My credit score has hovered around 760 until I opened up the Chase Freedom in May. (Currently around 740)

191,Help with JAL F/J Booking Using AA Miles,2,8qcgjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/8qcgjq/help_with_jal_fj_booking_using_aa_miles/,13,1528775682.0,"I have located and placed on hold JFK-NRT flights for next spring in JAL first and/or business.  My plan is to use AA miles to book.  If I book the JFK-NRT (which has an overnight) in first, and NRT-JFK in business, I need 140k AA miles per person.  If I book both ways in business, I only need 120k AA miles per person.

Here are my and my wife's current breakdown of miles and points:

Me:
AA = 51k
SPG = 121k
Marriott = 6k
MR = 131k
UR = 61k
No Citi TY points.

Wife:
AA = 46k
SPG = 39k
Marriott = 0
No MR, UR or Citi TY

If we do the F/J option at 140k each, here are my potential plans for getting there:

1) I transfer 80k SPG to AA, giving another 100k AA after 5,000 per 20,000 transfer bonus.  I now have 151k AA and can book.

I transfer my remaining 41k SPG to wife, which she combines with her 39k SPG, and then does the same as above, leaving her with 146k AA, enough to book.

Pros: no $ out of pocket, first class on overnight leg, business on return.
Cons: wipes out our SPG completely (which my not be a bad thing if they get nerfed when the rewards systems are merged in August)

2) I convert 88k SPG to Marriott for 264k Marriot.  Combine with my 6k Marriott for 270k Marriott and purchase Cat 1-5 flights and nights, with AA as my airline.  The 120k AA gives me 171k AA, enough to book.  Plus I have a 7-night certificate for Cat 1-5 Marriott.

I then give wife remaining SPG, bringing her to 72k SPG.  She purchases 18k SPG for $595, converts the now 90k SPG to 270k Marriott and buys another flights and nights.  She now has 120k AA to add to her 46k AA, for a total of 166k AA, plus a 7-night cat 1-5 certificate.

Pros: F/J RT for two to Japan plus 2 cat 1-5 7-night certificates, and left over AA miles (31k for me, 26k for wife).
Cons: $595 out of pocket.  Uncertain what will happen to certificates in August.

3) Alternatively, do the above at #2, but instead of purchasing SPG points for $, do one of the following:
     3(a) - Transfer 54,000 MR to 18,000 SPG
     3(b) - Transfer 54,000 UR to 54,000 Marriott points


If we do the J/J option at 120k each, here are the options I am considering:

4) I transfer 60k SPG to AA, giving me 75k AA, which with my 51k leaves me with 126k AA, enough to book J/J.

I give wife 21k SPG, which she combines with her 39K SPG, and transfers to 75k AA, giving her 121k AA - enough to book J/J.

Pros: no $ out of pocket, leaves me with 40k SPG.
Cons: No F on overnight to NRT.  

5) I convert 88k SPG to Marriott, combine with my 6k Marriott, and get one Cat 1-5 7-night certificate and 120k AA.  I combined the 120k AA with my 51k AA, leaving 171k AA.  Wife transfers me 27k SPG, giving me 60k SPG.  I transfer to AA, for 75k AA.  75k AA + 171k AA, and we can book both J/J, plus we have a 7 night certificate.

Pros: no $ out of pocket, leaves us with 27k SPG and all of my wife's AA intact, plus a 7 night certificate.
Cons: less left over SPG, no F.

6) Plan #2 or 3 above, but with way 20k extra AA left over for each of us.

I have several questions I was hoping you all could help me with.

A) What do you know about transfer times and limits for the above?  E.g., (i) time it takes for transfer of SPG between me and my wife, and any limits? (ii) time SPG transfers take to American, and any limits?, (iii) time it takes to convert SPG to Marriott, and any limits?, (iv) time it takes for AA miles from flights and nights to post to AA?

B) Is F on JAL worth it over J for the JFK-NRT leg or should I be content with J?

C) Is there anything I am missing?  E.g., should I be looking at Avios or Alaska or another airline?  Are there creative ways to use MR/UR that I missing?  Anything else?

D) General thoughts on which of the above is the best redemption?

I have also looked into American Airlines, but most of the flights I looked at using points still cost ~$1.5k! I have also heard really bad things about United, so am hesitant to go that route.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ","[""The reason why the AA flights you're looking at cost so much is because you're returning from London.  Returning from London is egregiously expensive because of taxes.  Additionally, the vast majority of return flights from London will involve British Airways, which charges fuel surcharges.  Search an AA award that goes into London and out of Germany and see the difference.\n\nAA is the only airline that will give you a discounted redemption rate in the off season.  For now.  Most of the folks in the know think that will be going away soon.\n\nAlso, the base redemption rate on any of the big 3 airlines is not affected by your departure airport.  So as long as you plan far enough ahead flying to Atlanta before departing the US will not save you any points/miles.\n\nFrankly, if I were you I'd get a Chase Southwest and Chase United card (when the bonus goes back to 50k, that is), use your Southwest card to cover your flights to Atlanta instead of transferring URs to Southwest, combine your URs with your United miles, and fly United.  60k miles per person roundtrip, so you'd need at most 20k in spend (if you're doing all 1x spend, which you won't be) on top of your bonus and existing UR balance.  "", ""None of this is really advice, but I was kind of in a similar situation as you just a few months ago. \n\nI just finished booking my 2016 Europe trip for me and my gf. JFK to CDG. And then TXL to JFK. That is New York to Paris and then Berlin to New York, if you don't know the codes. Anyway, we are going to Paris, then Montreux, Switzerland, then Milan, then Vienna, then Prague, then Berlin. All hotel rooms are paid for with points/free nights (I can provide more info about what we did if you want it).\n\nI was having trouble deciding on an airline, kind of like you, but I finally decided to focus on AA, mainly because the US Airways Card was still an option and they were merging soon.\n\nI was able to get up to 213k AA miles from a few sources: two AA cards (50k each), the US Airways Card (50k) and transferred some SPG (25k). Some other bonuses and normal spending got me to the 213k. That was enough for me to book two Business/First tickets, roundtrip (even though I actually booked them as one-ways), with 13k leftover.\n\nI was doing everything I could to avoid British Airways fee, which I was finally successful at doing. JFK to Paris is through US Airways. It isn't the non-stop AA flight I wanted, but it'll do. It only cost $11.40 in fees, where the BA flight would have been $911. I started searching for flights 331 days out and was about to give up (because only British Airways flights were showing up), but then finally the US Airways flight appeared, and I didn't hesitate to scoop it up. That extra stop is worth saving $911. I'm glad I got it, because I still search periodically and haven't seen any other non-BA options since.\n\nThe Berlin to JFK is through Airberlin, the exact flight I wanted, but the fees were a bit more, $175 or so. Still, had I booked all these flights with cash, it'd have been like $15,000 or some crazy shit.\n\nNot sure if any of this is helpful at all.\n\n\n"", ""The key with flying to Europe on AA award travel is to not fly on British Airways because they charge big fees. I'm going in first class from Miami to Berlin with a stopover in Madrid for lunch and the ticket was $21 because I found an AA flight for the transatlantic section.\n\nThe process for finding flights that I've used is approximately as follows:\n\n1. Find working routes on the oneworld map, http://onw.innosked.com/ . You can only get award fares on published routes, you can't just connect together a bunch of flights and book it.\n1. Look up that route on the American Airlines, British Airlines, and Qantas websites, searching for award flights.\n1. If one you like shows up on the AA site, book it there. If not, call AA and book it on the phone.\n\nThere are a good selection of routes and flights into Frankfurt from Austin through connecting airports, so you could do that in one award fare. You really do want to fly into London and out of Germany; I'm flying into Germany and out of Glasgow and it's going to cost me an extra couple hundred dollars in fees because I can't do it the other direction.\n\nOf course, this information is kind of useless for you because you don't have AA miles. I think they're one of the easiest ones to get through churning, and I'm managing a european round trip in first class by starting churning at the end of March and flying in October. So you have time.\n\nBut if you want to go with what you have, you need to either find United flights or transfer to Avios and book through BA. For the latter option you'll want to try to find transatlantic flights on Air Berlin, Aer Lingus, or Iberia. Which is definitely harder than finding BA xatlantic flights, bot possible, especially since you're planning so far ahead."", ""We cannot give you detailed, proper advice because you are not sharing key details.\nAnswer the following:\n\n* Do you mean Chase Sapphire Preferred or literally mean the Chase Sapphire? Those are two different credit cards.

I'll be flying JAL F from ORD-NRT on 9/16. I was hoping to use the First Class Lounge upon arrival.

Is there any way to get Gold status besides burning 3 weekends travelling round trip taking 2 stopovers per flight (18 EQS total)?

Update: Called AAdvantage. I can do the Gold Status Challenge for $140, just need 7,500 EQMs, or the Platinum Challenge for $200, just need 12,500 EQMs. Gold shouldn't be too difficult (like I said, I already have ~5000 EQMs lined up).

I have aaround 205K american airlines miles and 235K AMEX MR points. I am looking for an airline which allows them 2 checked baggage each with preferrably a stop somewhere in Europe. 

Thanks in advance!","['AA won’t give you a stopover in Europe and it’s not noticeably shorter, so with AA you’re looking at something like Del-doh-iah on Qatar for the quickest or Del-Hkg-lax-iah on Cathay \n\nThere’s also del-lhr-iah but you’d get dinged for surcharges', 'http://www.awardhacker.com/#f=DEL&t=IAH&a=mr&a=AA&o=0&c=y&s=1&p=0\n\n...is what I would like to point you to, but unfortunately AwardHacker\'s calculators aren\'t updated often enough for my liking, so you just need to be aware that its results aren\'t necessarily the full picture every time you search. It\'s still a great place to begin assessing your options, though. \n\nAlso, don\'t forget to price out the itineraries you\'re considering using the FF program that you will be booking through, in order to confirm the fees and fuel surcharges you\'ll be paying, because AwardHacker doesn\'t show those. Fuel surcharges in particular can vary wildly depending on both the metal you\'re flying on as well as the program you book through. \n\nBut anyway, this should be plenty straightforward assuming that by ""a stop somewhere in Europe"" you meant a layover (<24h), rather than a stopover. For flights matching your criteria, I would probably start looking for availability on KL via AMS and LH via FRA. Use AF\'s website to search AF/KL space (although the calendar search can be buggy, so you might be better off searching day-by-day), and use United\'s website to search LH space. This is just a starting point though; I am confident that you can figure out the rest yourself ;)', 'Also, you can book on Air France or KLM via Paris or Amsterdam. Flying Blue is a transfer partner of MR, and a random date in November shows 34k miles + $152 or $134.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo clarify are you looking for a round trip ticket or just one way from DEL to Houston? AF and Qatar include 2 pieces of checked luggage for this routing, but KLM may only allow 1, but would double check that.', 'Del-doh-iah should work as I do not want more than one stopover.', ""You will need to search Qatar's availability on the British Airways website. If you don't have a BAEC/Avios account (it's free), you need to sign up in order to access the search. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will need to search DEL-DOH and then DOH-IAH and find a date that both have 2 seats available. Once you find a date, go ahead and call American Airlines and feed them the flight numbers. Make sure the phone booking fee is waived as you can't book this on AA's website."", 'Thanks! Is there any particular way to search award seats at [ba.com](https://ba.com)? When I just tried DEL-DOH it says  ""Sorry, there are no direct flights for this route, flights with connections are below"". It is showing through LHR only.\n\n&#x200B;', 'You are going through the Book with Avios search right? It might just mean there are no seats available on that day. I checked a few random dates in December and found plenty of seats available - in both economy and business. Even plenty on the Houston route.

Although, you'd have to book 1 of the 4 in economy and wait for the points to post to upgrade, and hope the seat is still open.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: IF you need RT tickets. But if you only really need the one way flight, I would 100% use 70k AA miles for the 16 hour flight, especially if your parents are older. Business class for 20 hours, plus time to rest at one of the largest lounges in the world would be a very nice use of AA miles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, there's a good chance the flight to Houston will be equipped with Qsuites.

I am just seeing business class and no economy seats from IAH-DOH?', ""I checked a few days the first week and then a random date in mid November, but don't remember the exact dates. Looked at DEL-DOH and DOH-IAH. The 3 or 4 dates/flights I checked had 2-4 business and plenty of economy. May have misread your original post as the dates being flexible. Just search day by day for each leg. It's a long process, but worth it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know Cathay adds another stop, but could be worth a try."", 'OK. I was looking for return flights in Dec and am finding only business class. Economy ones are via LHR. \n\nDo you know how often does this availability changes, I mean for Dec return flight will it change or will it kind of stay same?\n\nAlso how to look up Cathay reward flights?\n\nMany thanks! You have been really helpful. ', ""Cathay should be the same process, but a bit more research involved. They fly via Hong Kong, so you will first need to find DEL to HKG, then HKG to the US. They fly to a few cities in the US (and Canada). Then you will need to find award seats from that North American city to Houston, which you can find availability for on AA or BA's site. You can fly on AA or Alaska, using AA miles. \n\nAward tickets may become available if someone cancels a flight or if Qatar decides to release more, which is unlikely. \n\nJust keep checking. Business class on this route is a great deal if you get the DOH to IAH route, so I would splurge. AA miles are easy to earn. ""]"

Due to the length of travel visas for Americans (90 days) and my time already spent in Europe, **I'll need to leave by Oct. 23**. I'd like to fly from Europe to SE Asia, specifically BKK, Singapore, or anywhere central nearby that is affordable.

I'll most likely have to take a train, regional flight, or some transport to a larger hub city in Europe from wherever I'm at to make the trip. This is fine, the only preference is airports that are closer to the Central/Eastern cities (i.e. Italy, Germany, Austria, etc. versus airports in Madrid or Paris, **if possible**). 

However, I'm not sure what cities are transfer partners/hubs for the airlines I currently have points with.

Can anyone help me with suggestions on where to fly from and who to transfer my points to for dates that are near the one I have posted?

Both are free to join and utilize. And yes, if you find the flights you are interested in on QF or BA, you can call AA and feed those flights to an AA CSR to book. Be aware that sometimes BA will show phantom award availability. This means that the BA site will show that flight as available, but AA won't be able to see it when you call. I generally recommend if you're searching for a flight that will have a stop, that you search segment by segment (i.e., FRA-DOH and then DOH-BKK, etc). BA has a known issue with showing the first flight availability as all of the flights in the trip's availability when there may be none (for example, SIN-HKG may have 4 seats in J while HKG-ORD has zero, but BA will show 4 J seats if you searched SIN-ORD). Searching segment by segment eliminates this potential issue."", ""Also remember that BA shows a lot of premium economy availability. Premium economy seats are not bookable with AA miles. You will need to find economy availability (or J/F availability if that's what you're looking for) for it to be bookable with AA."", ""yeah, the flights are the exact same, its just a business class seat vs an economy class seat.

SEA -> AKL (RT) flights in late Feb/Mar (2 adults). Spent the last few days scouring the internet/forums and found a re-occuring theme. Looking to get a sanity check and hopefully some guidance.

Baseline point situation: 110k MR, \~40k Alaska Airlines, \~87k UR, \~200k HHonors

Theoretically, I should have enough points to make this trip work. Initially I'm willing to burn the \~40k AA to get to LAX/SFO or YVL to AKL and the MR to pay at least half of the fare there. It appears that AA/UA are the best domestic & low travel time options in this case. I've also considered the Asia route to HK but the wife isn't willing to add another 12+ hrs on the trip.

Best deal I can find is 160k points (RT for 2) on American Airlines which seems average for this time of year. (Originating from LAX/SFO). I also am having trouble finding info on doing partial point/cash options (I may have to call) but, is there anything I could be missing in my research/options? Thanks in advance!","['I know this isn’t advice on how to use points, but There have been some deals to NZ and AUS over the past few weeks.\n\nScott’s cheap flight deals had Lax-Auk from Jan-Mar the other day for $420 rt.\n\nIf you’re able to catch one of those deals, you could use some points through the UR portal to help with the price.

You could use your AS points for one ticket and transfer MR to BA for another ticket, both on AA metal. Your points make it easy to do one leg on United.

204,UK to Hawaii (via Florida and LA) with Miles,14,c38ni0,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c38ni0/uk_to_hawaii_via_florida_and_la_with_miles/,12,1561139486.0,"My family is based in the UK and I just finished booking a trip for my Mum and Dad who had to be out in Florida for a friend's wedding this September.

Dad had a collection of miles with a bunch of different airlines but didn't really understand how to use them or how they worked e.g. that you could use KrisFlyer miles to book a ticket with Alaskan Airlines.

The first step was to actually get them to pin-down what they wanted to do. Dad originally wanted to visit the Caribbean, but late-Sept/October is hurricane season so they were talked out of this. Based on the miles that the did have, I encouraged them to visit somewhere in the US but explained that, at a push, I could maybe get them out to Hawaii.

I knew they needed 60K AA miles to get them back to the UK from North America. Dad had around 59K, so the first step was to top up that balance. Purchasing 2K AA miles (the minimum) from AA would have cost $94, but we were able to purchase 3K Marriott points for just $34.

With that sorted, I booked LGW-MCO with Norwegian using cash. I planned to fly them MAN-LGW with Avios but then realised they had enough VS miles for MAN-MCO direct. Luckily, Norwegian allow you to cancel within 24 hours of your original purchase at no expense. 

Here's what we ended up booking (per person):

1. MAN-MCO with VS for 12.5K VS miles + £176
2. MCO-LAX with JBU for £180
3. LAX-OGG with AS for 15K AS miles + £4
4. OGG-HNL with HA for £63
5. HNL-LAX with AS for 13K Avios/KrisFlyer miles + £4
6. LAX-PHL-MAN with AA for 30K AA miles + £4.5

There will be some additional baggage charges on their HA/AS flights but they aren't excessive. The JBU flights include checked baggage. I've got them 8 days on Maui and 3 full days on Oahu, with a day in LA in either direction and 4 days in Orlando for the wedding.

Personally, I was really pleased to use up a series of small mileage balances like this. We've basically used up all of Dad's KrisFlyer miles, his Virgin Atlantic miles and his American Airlines miles. I also used most of his Avios and most of my Alaskan miles (leftover from Marriott travel package conversion and a trip to Hong Kong) It's a lot of flying (and all of it in economy) but they were insistent they didn't want to fly in business e.g. via a paid ticket and upgrading with miles.

Added to that, it's bloody expensive getting to Hawaii from the UK, so their actual cash expenditure here is pretty low. I chose to route them into cities they wanted to see (they are stopping with friends in LAX in both directions) as opposed to maximising the use of their miles. The Alaskan miles would have taken them from Florida to Hawaii but required flying through Seattle or Portland and often included a long layover.

207,help with an existing booking (ticket may be canceled?),0,7otksl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7otksl/help_with_an_existing_booking_ticket_may_be/,12,1515390053.0,"I'm a moderately experienced award traveler, probably 7 or 8 big multicity trips with my wife, but this is the most peculiar situation and I'm looking for some help:

&nbsp;

I've booked LATAM flight 2481 (LA2481) from Washington (IAD) to Lima (LIM) on 3/21/18 for my wife and I via American Airlines miles (30,000 per person in business class).

&nbsp;

Recently, I wanted to invite friends on the trip, but both British Airways website and LATAMs website show zero availability in either Business or Economy for this flight.

&nbsp;

Additionally, this flight runs on Sundays, Mondays, and Wednesdays, yet there is no availability showing March 4th, 2018 through the end of schedule. However, availability is abundant prior to March 4th. 

&nbsp;

I booked my flight 8 months ago, but this oddity in scheduling makes me believe the flight will be canceled (and I need to start making reservations in Peru for certain activities, like Machu Picchu). While I believe Chase Sapphire Reserve would protect me on non-refundable bookings, that's a hassle, and this week is the only week my wife can travel in the spring, so having it canceled last minute would ruin our vacation plans. American Airlines and LATAM call centers both say the flight is still on and nothing is wrong and they refuse to consider that something odd is happening. That seems really off, but I don't know what to do... I'm getting frustrated with HUCA and getting another rep that says exactly what the system says and won't investigate the anomaly. LATAM reps refuse to allow me to speak with a supervisor (I believe they get in a lot of trouble if that happens). What should I do? ","[""Why would you possibly think a flight might be canceled because there's limited award inventory on a given route?

That's not dynamic pricing. It may not be canceled, but something must be up with their system.

Recently came up that I'm going to have to work from home for 2 months or so due to my office's re-location. However, we have a Scotland office and thanks to /r/churning, I've been accumulating points, so have been considering working from Scotland (leaving from RDU) for October and maybe November.

This 7.5k discount means no British Airways flights, only American.  And that's fine, because it looks like there's availability almost every day in AA's nonstop flight RDU-LHR.  Please note that LHR has exorbitant departure fees that are not covered by miles, so a RT with miles costs $175.66 in fees.  Many people choose to fly into LHR, but depart from another airport to save that fee.  It would also appear that there is open availability on the connecting route to EDI through NYC, but that would require you to make the dreaded LGA to JFK connection.\n\nDelta's RDU-CDG nonstop also is wide open.  You could use Avios to get to Scotland.

I'd like to try and get status on an airline-- what would be the best airline to try and get status on?

Being able to upgrade to business class is more important than a direct connection to me. 

These are my options:
American (OneWorld)
United (direct flights)
Delta (direct flights starting next year)

","['[deleted]', ""Based on your comments, I would strongly consider British Airways program. You'll be flying out of JFK (LGA construction makes it a bad pick for the next year or so imo) and spend a fair amount of time on BA anyway. Their program isn't great for redeeming miles on award tickets trans Atlantic, but they allow you to upgrade purchased economy tickets to business class using miles; it costs the difference between an economy award ticket and a business award ticket to upgrade. You can do this without having any status at all, which makes it quite versatile. This would be the way you could most consistently score upgrades, plus after you generate some status you'll have access to BA and AA lounges in the US, UK, and something in Berlin as well. It's worth noting that BA status is not based on miles flown, it's based on a currency called Tier Points. You get a certain number for each segment that you fly, with a commensurately higher number for premium tickets. You could even have an upgrade on one of your first flights potentially if you picked up the British Airways Visa card from Chase--the bonus is 50k Avios right now, but it has gone up to 100k Avios a couple times in the past few years. One additional perk of BA's program is they do soft landings from elite status, so if you reach Executive Club Gold next year, you'll have it the year after then have Silver the year after that. That's almost 3 years of guaranteed lounge access and perks when flying oneworld even if you don't requalify for anything after that point.\n\nI'm not as familiar with airBerlin's program, but they are currently reducing their operations to be more of a network carrier with a focus on Berlin and Dusseldorf. This could definitely work for you, but I would be somewhat concerned about their future in the oneworld alliance given LH's interest in them and their financial problems.\n\nFor Star Alliance, the fastest way to get status would be Aegean Airlines, but that wouldn't help you out so much with upgrades. Miles and More (Lufthansa's program) also has an upgrade award option but I think at a higher mileage cost. One advantage of this program, though, is that you can actually upgrade flights on other Star Alliance partners (disclaimer: I have not actually done this, but it says pretty clearly on the program's website that you can). There is a Miles and More credit card from Barclays US as well if you wanted to kick start that mileage balance.\n\nI really wouldn't do much with Skyteam. They're the least cohesive alliance and don't really have standardized elite benefits across carriers. They also don't have an ideal airline for flights to Germany from the US. If you were absolutely committed to Skyteam, I would look at Flying Blue before Delta Skymiles--maybe even Millemiglia. Basically oneworld has done the best job integrating the cross-alliance experience with some of the nicest defined elite perks. Star Alliance has done an ok job as well, but with a bigger route network. From my read of your priorities, it sounds like BA Executive Club is the winning program, but Miles and More or possibly TopBonus are worthy competitors. I'm not sure I'd choose the US programs both because of revenue requirements (if you're buying economy tix, you'll likely struggle to meet the higher status revenue dollars) and because I think most of your flying will be on international partners anyway.

Looking to book a flight from PHL to FCO in November but have a few basic questions as some things aren't 100% clear to me.  Information below:



>Where are you departing from? (feel free to list multiple airports if acceptable)


PHL is highly, highly preferred but can try to be flexible if it works out better elsewhere.



>Where are you flying to? (feel free to list multiple airports if acceptable)


Rome (FCO)


>When do you plan on travelling and how flexible are you with these dates?


Early November; want to depart on 11/3 or 11/4 and return 11/15 or 11/16


>What class of travel are you looking for (e.g. economy, business, first, suite)?


Business highly preferred.



>What points / miles do you currently have?


I have 225k AA miles.



>How many people will be travelling with you? Do they have miles as well?


One other who has ~80k AA miles. 



>What have you found so far? (see rule 4)


So here's where my questions begin:  for example, a business class round trip for one PHL-FCO is 290k (premium economy is 185k).  Is there a way to combine both of our miles (225+80) for one ticket (we'd pay cash for the other in this case)?  Or is it possible to book one class (e.g. premium economy) and upgrade to business with cash, or vice-versa?  


Apologies if these are very basic questions, first time doing this.


**edit:** we are still working on our itinerary while there so if there is a way to make this work with our points if we arrive at FCO but return to PHL via another AA direct flight (Venice, Milan) that might work too.","['Are you quoting an AAnytime price? 290k for PHL-FCO is quite high.', ""You would be able to upgrade the paid ticket from premium economy to business using miles, assuming availability - AA would charge 15,000 miles for the upgrade:\n\n[https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/redeem/award-travel/upgrade-with-miles.jsp](https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/redeem/award-travel/upgrade-with-miles.jsp)\n\nThis, again, assumes that the upgrade is actually available - you would want to check with AA or use a site such as ExpertFlyer to see whether there is upgrade space before you pull the trigger on what you want to do.\n\nAll that having been said, there is no way that I would use 290,000 AA miles for a single RT to Europe - I'd personally be looking at other airports on either side of the Atlantic for something considerably cheaper.  For example, a quick search of the AA site shows availability flying between PHL and Madrid (via Manchester) for 115,000 miles round-trip per ticket (departing 11/4 and returning 11/14).  From there, it would be simple to pick up a round-trip ticket to Rome - there are four different airlines flying between MAD and FCO - that probably wouldn't be that expensive."", 'Can share points across accounts for a fee, but do not do this. Do not book these tickets at this price. Better luck next year (start looking in Dec/Jan later this year for Nov 2020).', 'I believe so, yes.', 'He is.  Ive been looking recently at PHL to EUR, Saver directs on AA metal basically are non-existent even looking months out or last minute.', 'Thanks, really appreciate the advice. We were trying to keep it as simple as possible with direct flights (honeymoon) but if we can cover it almost fully on points with a connection or two we might end up going that route.', ""I assume the fee is prohibitively expensive then?  Thanks for the heads up.  I would consider doing it 2020 but I'm not sure my fiance will want to push the honeymoon back that far :)"", ""So AA J Saver gets scarfed up early typically?  Ive used UA on LH J out of PHL before so i'm used to availability opening up later rather than at 365 days out."", ""It's stupid this year.  I gave up and just burned the rest of my UA miles."", ""Given that you are planning this trip as soon as you are, being flexible with respect to your options is the best thing that you can do at this point.  Even though November isn't generally the high season for travel to Europe, there are some destinations where the demand is always higher, and I would put Rome squarely into that category.\n\nAs other people have implied, it's possible that the award tickets for this route, if AA ever made them available, were snagged as soon as they were loaded into the schedule last December.  This doesn't happen with every route, though - hence, why it's possible to find availability for your dates on the PHL-MAN route.\n\nThus, if you're willing to be flexible enough to consider alternative airports and paying for separate tickets, you'll be able to use the miles you do have more effectively and efficiently.  Sure, there will be money out of pocket for those separate tickets - but I and most people here would tell you that spending $500 out of pocket for an extra pair of tickets is going to be a lot better for you than spending 290,000 miles for one award ticket and then spending another $2,000 for a second paid ticket, just so you don't have to connect somewhere else.\n\nSpend some time playing around with the AA site and see what's there.  If the PHL-MAN flight doesn't work for you, consider flying to CDG - there is availability around that time on the nonstop MIA-CDG flight, which can easily be built into a PHL-MIA-CDG award - and at least five different airlines flying nonstop between CDG and FCO."", ""More like never loaded at all. Some routes are just random and you'll occasionally see business class availability, but don't hold your breath.""]"

I'll start by saying thank you for any help you can provide.

I have enough miles for one ticket on both American and United.  We have thought about booking one of us on American and one on United, or just choosing only one airline and getting one ticket with miles and purchasing the other. The latter option is our preference, but do you see a reason why we should consider using only miles for this?

If we were to purchase one and use miles for the other, when is the best time to start looking and booking? When can we expect mileage seats to become available, and by when will they likely be booked up?

I am flying from CLT to BCN next year and I found a couple of flights that will work for me but the problem is I can't book them all together as a one way ticket. When I search the American site for CLT to BCN these flights do not show up. If I search for multi-city and then manually put in CLT to LHR and then LHR to BCN the flights do show up and I can book them as a multi-city ticket. Before booking this I have a few concerns:

* First, baggage. Will my checked baggage make it all the way through to BCN without me having to go claim it in LHR and re-check it, go through security, etc. Google searching seems to indicate that it will, but it's really hard to tell if people legitimately are talking about multi-city booked flights (my situation) vs. a flight that is booked with one or more stops but is still ticketed together as one itinerary (not my situation).
* Second, flight delays or cancellations. If my overnight flight from CLT to LHR is delayed or cancelled how does this affect my second flight from LHR to BCN? It's not a connecting flight if I book a multi-city, right? It's just a second standalone flight? So if there are delays or cancellations what that mean for my situation? To make it even more complicated the first flight is on AA and the second flight is on BA.
* Third, flight changes. In a similar vein to the above, what happens if the first flight is changed by AA ahead of time, but to the point that I would miss the second flight? Are they obligated to work with me and straighten things out or am I out of luck since it's not technically a connecting flight and it's on 2 different airlines (though it's all booked through AA)?","['\\>If I search for multi-city and then manually put in CLT to LHR and then LHR to BCN the flights do show up and I can book them as a multi-city ticket. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs long as all segments are ticketed together as you describe, you will be protected.

231,[Award Advice] Help with my plan for vacation from San Diego to Europe,5,3bug5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3bug5u/award_advice_help_with_my_plan_for_vacation_from/,10,1435847090.0,"Hey /r/awardtravel!

I'm looking to travel by myself from San Diego around October 15th to London and then from Berlin back to San Diego on/after November 1st. I will be in London on October 15th-18th, Brussels on October 24th-25th, and Berlin at least on October 31st (probably before too).

My first thing to tackle is flight plans. I would prefer flying in first class, but I am fine with coach. Leg room is my main concern since I'm a tall guy. I have 79,347 Delta miles and 111,223 American Airlines miles. I can fly into other locations in Western Europe, but there are events in London/Berlin on the days I indicated. My home airport is San Diego, but I would be willing to go up to Los Angeles for the right deal (it would have to be a great one though). It looks like I can fly first/business class on AA for 50k miles per round of the trip, for 100k total. Any better suggestions, or a way I can use my Delta miles for first class?

My second thing to tackle is hotel arrangements for my ~2 weeks in Europe. I have the free night certificates from the Chase IHG/Marriott cards from keeping the cards (got them last summer). I also have 97,376 Marriott points and 68,944 IHG points. I don't need to stay in super fancy hotels. 

Thoughts/tips/suggestions on flights, hotels, or places to go on the dates I didn't specify above? 

Note: I am considering opening up new cards for the trip, but I haven't decided yet. I've already used the Amex PRG and Delta (personal) in the past, as well as the CSP. I have a ton of UR miles but no open card that transfers (didn't want to pay CSP annual fee at the time).","[""Have you even searched yet?\n\nLAX-SFO-LHR is available on the 14th, arriving in LHR on the 15th.

I'd be traveling one-way with a bicycle as checked baggage. My dates are flexible (September 15 +/- one week would be ideal) as are my departure airports (GLA, EDI, NCL, MAN, LHR in that order). I currently have 252k American, 85k Delta, 105k United and 190k Ultimate Rewards (CSR) miles/points.

Here's the best of what I've found so far:

* F on Etihad (115k AA miles + $317, multiple dates) LHR-AUD-SYD
* J on Etihad (85k AA + $317, one date only) LHR-AUH-SYD
* J on BA/Qantas (85k AA + $542, one date) LHR-KIX-SYD  
* J on KLM/China Airlines (90k Delta + $452, multiple dates) GLA-AMS-TPE-SYD
* J on Austrian/Air India (90k United + $305) LHR-VIE-DEL-SYD
* Y on BA (32.5k Avios + $510, multiple dates) GLA-LHR-SIN-SYD 

**Big question:** Are there exceptional redemption opportunities (under 90k for J) or better routing options I haven't considered? I called American yesterday and they found no J availability on partners Qatar, Malaysian, Cathay Pacific or Japan Airlines for the entire month of September. I've also searched for award availability on Juicymiles with limited success. I'm thinking Etihad in J or F is the best choice although that would involve checking in twice if I'm starting further north. I have a 5-day hold on the lone Etihad J ticket and would appreciate feedback before I commit.

*Other considerations:* Using my American or Delta miles first; experiencing a premium biz/first class product if possible; okay with long layovers if I can chill in a nice lounge and don't have to claim/re-check my bags; avoiding excessive oversize bag fees is a plus; avoiding London, China and India is also a plus; would be willing to fly into another Australian city (MEL or ADL in particular) if that helps.","['Singapore Air is certainly worth a consideration.

I write http://www.seat31b.com. I like cheap, and I like free. I'd like to write a little about answering the door when opportunity knocks. It doesn't look like this is really covered in the FAQ and I don't think most bloggers do a very good job of explaining just how urgent prompt action is in securing award seats.

Last year, I traveled from LA to Paris to Budapest to Amsterdam to Beijing. It cost a little over $300. But I earned miles, which really made it almost free. I grabbed whatever dates I could, booked the ticket, and the deal died an hour later.

Also last year, I went to India. Roundtrip tickets from LA to Mumbai on Emirates were $450.30. I earned Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles, offsetting a substantial portion of the cost. As soon as I finished booking, the deal was dead. Cities and routes were dropping like flies while I tried to book, so I just grabbed what I could. I knew nothing about Mumbai.

I'm flying to Manila in two weeks. The ticket cost $499.50 roundtrip. As soon as I became aware of the deal, I booked the ticket, using dates I thought might work. The deal died a few minutes later.

On a mileage itinerary from Costa Rica to Seattle, I booked early, grabbed the only itinerary available (which had a forced overnight in Toronto), and then watched carefully. There was a schedule change that allowed me a free ticket change, so the moment inventory opened up on a better connection, I called in to do it. I was home for Christmas instead of sitting in a Toronto airport hotel.

I needed to get from Beijing to Los Angeles using Alaska miles. There is a nonstop Delta flight and I would much rather have taken it than going on Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong. However, Cathay Pacific is what was available so I booked it. I ended up leaving myself a few extra hours in Hong Kong and ended up meeting a friend there for dinner. We had a great time running around Mong Kok which would never have happened otherwise. And that Delta flight? A seat on it never opened up. Good thing I jumped on the one option that was open, because it turned out that it was the only one that ever would be. Additional ones never opened up.

Are you seeing a pattern here? When there was a deal, I jumped on it right away, figured out how to make everything else around it work, and that's how I got it. People who waited around until they got approval from the boss or talked to their spouse or thought maybe something better would open up saw the deal vanish. And that's just fine with me. In business and in life, hustle usually wins.

This is as true with award tickets as it is with mistake fares. You're rarely going to get a 100% perfect itinerary with award tickets. If I help you (I have been experimenting with helping people in this forum, although I don't know if it's going to work out long-term yet), you might end up with a day to spend in New York or Seattle along the way. Actually, it's a bonus! They are both wonderful cities. There is nothing quite like enjoying a morning in Central Park or a coffee at the original Starbucks at the Pike Place Market before you hop on your flight to points beyond. It's an incredible world we live in.

The one thing that is absolutely key with frequent flier tickets: inventory changes all the time, and seats disappear in an instant. There is a lot of competition--who doesn't like free? **Two seats together is hard to find in any class** so this is a particularly difficult ask. Yes, I know the big travel bloggers make it look so easy, but they all have relationships with the airlines. You and I don't.

In the past few days, I have found a few folks some extremely hard-to-find seats (such as for two seats together on summer travel to Europe) only to watch them delay booking and look for better options. I know how this movie ends: there probably won't actually be any better options. Ever. **Airlines can sell all of the seats anyway** so they have almost zero incentive to give away a perfect itinerary. So yes, I hate flying United, especially in coach, I don't like 6 in the morning EVEN A TINY BIT, and getting stuck in New York for the day may not be exactly what I'd planned. However, you'd better believe I'll do it if it's free and it's the only available option.

Book something that isn't 100% perfect? There are still ways you can change an award ticket later. American and Alaska both allow free changes. A schedule change will usually allow you to rebook at no charge if the new itinerary is less convenient (and schedules change all the time). If you stay on top of a less-than-perfect itinerary, you can often (though not always) find ways to improve it later.

About three/four years ago I was signing up for multiple cards and programs. I was really on top of the game at that point and was fortunate that I could use my cards and get reimbursed for biz travel. For some reason, I never made much use out of the miles once I earned them. A bit intimidated as to what to do with them. My goal for the next few months is to make the most of what I have and not spend $$ on flights. 

Would it make any sense to combine them all into just one or two programs? I think some of the intimidation of using my miles is that they are all over the place and I'm not sure what to use or what gets the ""best value"". As time has gone along, they have become less and less valuable (esp Alaska). So I would like to spend them soon. Would it be easier to keep them in one bank so to speak?

* Where are you departing from? Flexible. I'll be in ORD for XMas but can take a domestic flight wherever I need to go. 
* Where are you flying to? Singapore and then Thailand (can I do a stopover flight for a day or two?)
* When do you plan on traveling and how flexible are you with these dates? 12/25 evening if out of ORD, 12/26 whenever if out of anywhere else
* What class of travel are you looking for (e.g. economy, business, first, suite)? Biz/First/Suite 
* What points / miles do you currently have? 500k+ miles with American. 150k Amex. 50k Chase (should be 150k soon once they release new Chase card). 30k Citi. 
* How many people will be traveling with you? Do they have miles as well? Just me. 
* What have you found so far? 

Singapore Airlines: Best deal I've found so far is with Singapore Airlines: SFO -> SIG (FLIGHT SQ1) leaves at 00:05 from SFO with stopover in HKG for either 107k (Suite) or 80k (Biz) but through **waitlist**. If I transfer miles and don't get via waitlist, I'm kinda SoL there.

Emirates + Etihad: Both in the 150k+ miles range and have high copays, so not interested there. Also travel time is too long since I fly east. 

ANA: Will check once I figure out their website. 

Cathay: I will be booking the return with Cathay (via American) for sure since I don't know my exact return date, and can just book a bunch of award tickets for free as an ExecPlat. No award tickets available yet, but I believe with new American award charts I'm looking at at least 100k to 150k miles one way for biz or first. 

***
Stopover Ticket: don't know much about this. Is there a way to buy with miles a stopover ticket from SFO/ORD -> somehow get to SIG and spend a night or two there -> BKK? 
***
Edit: **Plans changed and BKK Is now final destination**","[""First off it's SIN, not SIG for Singapore. Since you're looking to fly on a one-way ticket, there are no options that will offer a stopover in SIN or BKK. NH doesn't allow one-way award tickets (there's a way around it, but it's not worth it in your case), so count that option out. \n\nEdit: SQ will allow a stopover on a one-way award ticket for I believe it is $100. You would need to work your stopover in SIN though.\n\nOverall, the bottom line is you're likely too late to the game to find J or F award space around the holiday. And if you do, it's likely going to cost you a good amount (in either points or taxes/fees or both). I'd recommend you use the transfer partners for US credit cards link in the sidebar to start parsing through your options of airlines to book through. You may get lucky with a business class seat on someone, but I wouldn't hold out a lot of hope. I'd also consider cashing in some of the AA miles on a JL flight to BKK/SIN through NRT/HND.
