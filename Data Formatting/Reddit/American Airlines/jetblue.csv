0,PHL-BOS-SFO. 100% worth the connection,4,7alngf,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/7alngf/phlbossfo_100_worth_the_connection/,8,1509765473.0,"As A PHL'er I'm stuck with AA For Pretty much everything.  I had the misfortune of flying on a ""1995 Flashback Special"" American Airlines 757 for 7 hours from PHL-LIS this summer.  This flight was the worst one Ive ever flown.  This was a 7+ hour flight with no power outlets and no IFE.  At that point id had it with AA.

So for my fall SFO trip, I decided to give JetBlue a try.  However this meant giving up the direct flight and connecting through BOS.  Totally worth it because:

- The gate agents seem to actually care about their customers (Unlike the AA agents who seem to be more interested in their iPhones)

- The on board entertainment options are fantastic (and POWER OUTLETS!) 

- The flight attendants actually seem to care about their jobs (as evidenced by the ""service first"" attitude)

All in all, I hope B6 shows PHL some love in the future with more flights as I will definitely fly them again.
","['I assume you only had power on the BOS-SFO leg (A321)? I was not aware they started replacing seats on the other planes yet. ', 'What did it cost to access the Internet?', ""Yeah. But it's better than going all the way from PHL to SFO with no power"", 'Jetblue flyfi is free ', ""Agreed!  They plan to do it in the A320s too.  How was the legroom? I heard it's a little tighter than the current config, but still manageable. "", ""Still better than a US Airways spec 321.  The AA product out of PHL is laughably bad.  Especially for international. (Unless you're on a high-volume flight like LHR Or CDG/FRA when you get an A330)"", 'My one and only AA flight was on a 727.  I like UA about as much as you like AA, thus I trek to JFK for B6 anything other than Florida. ', ""Also VX/AS started LAX/SFO service from PHL a couple months ago.  United also has an SFO flight but it's always oversold and expensive due to PHL not having any Asia service (I think PHL is the biggest airport in the world with no Asia service) thus making this flight full of connecting traffic for flights on United to Asia.
