""Passengers will be able to hold a reservation without payment, or cancel a booking without penalty, for 24 hours after the reservation is made, if they make the reservation one week or more prior to a flight’s departure date.""

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

So I disputed the $200 fee with my bank, and just now I've realized that I lost the dispute.","['Read the policy again. It says ""cancel"" not change free of charge. You should have just asked for it to be canceled and refunded not changed if that\'s what you wanted.', 'You got scammed by a 3rd party. Why would Delta rebook you on American?', ""It sure sounds like you didn't speak with a real Delta agent.  A Delta agent isn't going to get you on American unless there are IRROPS.

I would hope that Delta employees on the phone would understand and talk you through cancelling and re-booking if you were within that window.

There was a scam posted here recently where a Google Ad popped up with a fake phone number when searching for ""Delta phone number"" or something similar. Do you have a valid PNR for that American flight? What does the charge look like on your end? Anybody can cancel a flight if you have the PNR and first/last name of the passenger travelling.\n\n3) This subreddit has a lot more DL frequent fliers than employees. A lot of people will come here to complain about something that is sort of their fault, like purchasing a Basic Economy ticket and then trying to change it, or similar things.

1,Diamonds: How many domestic MQMs you get this year? I'm really curious.,14,ae9bxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/ae9bxp/diamonds_how_many_domestic_mqms_you_get_this_year/,36,1547085122.0,"I'm really curious how many other people fly domestically as much as I do. I've been Diamond since 2008 when they started the 4-tier system. But I've always flown United as my second airline and maintained a Platinum status with them, even making 1K one year in 2012. I decided to only get Silver with United this past year and have upped my Delta flights because of this. Delta is way better anyway!

I'm based out of the PNW and fly to the east coast a lot and hit 176,656 MQMs (~21,000 rollover), 141 MQSs, and $22,553 MQDs. On United I had 29,185 PQMs, as well as ~11,000 miles on Alaska, and a measly 1,302 EQMs on American. A grand total of about 197,143 if I did my math correctly.

I have had the worst experience that I could EVER have on Delta-let alone ANY airline. Here is a log of the complaints that I wrote to Delta. I will update you with their response. 

8/8/2016 @ 5:30pm

Flight #5234 DTW-YUL
This was my second flight coming from SAN (redeye). The redeye was fine because I slept through the whole thing.
Female flight attendant rude. Said nothing to me but pushed the customs form at me, then put a smile on and spoke respectfully to the other customers. 
I then said good morning and she blew me off.
It's common courtesy.
In addition to the plane being delayed for THREE hours, now there is a mechanical issue and we have deplaned, then replaned-just to deplane once again an go to a different gate. While this is happening,  she proceeds to gossip about customers at the bay with the other steward.
Then she kept talking the whole time about everyone else and everything else. Which was annoying.
Next, another uniformed Delta employee boarded the plane and complained to the other crew members, ""I want to go home."".
Why on earth did I pay for first class to be snubbed, and be made to listen to gossip and complaints. I have my own job where that happens and I would prefer more of a professional environment when flying. 
The behavior from this young woman is appalling-as we are not hormonal high schoolchildren-we are adults. I do not enjoy being treated as if your employees have a personal issue with me, or anyone else for that matter.
While there's a maintenence delay, turning your back on the passengers and gossiping is not appropriate.
So I arrived 3 hours later, and my boyfriend had to keep switching things around to pick me up since the departure times/planes/gates kept changing. 

Flight #6278 YUL-DTW
I arrived at the airport at 0300 for a 0538 flight in which I stood for an hour and a half until the attendants realized that this was a global issue and they issued me a manual ticket. I checked one bag and went to my gate where I sat for over 5 hours until we could finally board the plane. Once boarded, we still took off late and finally arrived at DTW. 

Flight #833 DTW-SAN
The Delta team were instructed to merge flight #600 and #833 together, and that caused not only a late plane arrival I'm sure from the chaos, but also we sat on the tarmac for almost 2 additional hours until we FINALLY were set to leave, which of course was late. We took off around 1330, after hearing several other times for take off. It was the longest flight ever. I asked simple questions such as, ""What is our expected arrival time?"" so that I can arrange my pick up, and the first answer I got was, ""Yep, don't know."" then later followed by, ""Add up the time."" WHAT?! This is definitely NOT the right time for attitude-not like it ever is, but definitely not a professional response. There are better ways to handle these questions if one does not know. Once we finally arrived in SAN-5 hours later, I received a voicemail stating that my luggage did no make it on the plane??!!! Seriously? 
So at this point I made my way over to the baggage claim service desk where the young lady whom was pleasant, informed me that they ""think"" my bag ""may"" be on that flight, but ""not sure"". I then ask to have to have the bag delivered, to which she replied that they cannot deliver my bag-that your company lost-in the time in which I need it. So, after only receiving 2 hours of sleep, and being stuck in airports for a total of 15 hours-I cried. I left the airport crying and shaking. In addition to this, I missed work today, which in turn means that I have missed pay. Now I must go back to the airport tonight to look for my luggage that ""may or may not"" be here, thus spending MORE time in an airport! 
Between the delays-and not just this worldwide delay-but the first one I experienced going to Montréal, the attitude, and the lack of concern for my belongings-there is no evidence of service recovery. Why on EARTH would I EVER want to experience this negativity ever again??!! 
The part about this that really burns me up is that I paid for FIRST CLASS on EACH flight and instead I paid double to be treated terribly. 
I just opened an LLC, and as a business owner, I understand that things go wrong sometimes. But this is a SERVICE industry, and I feel cheated, and like I have ripped off. 



An EXTREMELY disappointed customer, 



8/8 @ 10:15pm

I AM NOW ADDING AN ADDENDUM TO MY COMPLAINT THAT I SENT OUT EARLIER WHICH IS ATTACHED. 

My baggage has been missing for almost 12 hours at this point. I received a voicemail saying that my baggage was not on my original flight, and that it would be to me around 7:30pm. I arrived at the baggage claim office in San Diego and asked that my luggage be delivered to me tonight, and the customer service agent told me that there was nothing that she could do, so she called the manager. I waited for the manager to come, who never introduced himself-and he said that my baggage is now coming at 10:30pm. I told him that I cannot keep coming back and that I need it to be delivered to my house tonight-I work in an operating room and I have things in my luggage that I need for work, not to mention that I have already lost a day of work due to the massive delays! He said it would be at my house around 2am. I then asked for a tracking number or something in which to follow up, and he then raised his voice at me and said, ""I aint giving you anything. I told you it would be there, and it will."". I cannot trust that it will arrive at my home just because he said so-I don't even know who he is! I asked again and I insisted saying ""I NEED a tracking number or something in which will make it easier to follow up."", and he responded again to me, ""I don't have to give you any of that."", as he angrily flicked a piece of paper in my direction. 

 I lost my temper. After being stuck in first Montréal and then Detroit for a total of 15 hours on two hours of sleep, and I responded, ""Don't give me any f-ing attitude. I don't have the patience and I just need my bag."". He then yelled at me and said, ""I am going to call the Harbor Police on you, they will straighten you out."". 
So I also proceeded to call the police to have them come as a mediator. 




Once the police arrived, I told them that I needed a mediator because there is information that I need that he-as a manager in customer service is refusing to give me. I asked them to stay and ensure that I get the information that I need. 
None of the customer service representatives knew where to deliver my bag, they did not have my phone number but told me it would be delivered? How?? I was told that my bag would be there at 7:30-what happened there? 

More importantly, threatening to have me arrested for cussing is not an arrest-able offense, and is COMPLETELY inappropriate in handling a customer service issue-in which he proceeded to yell at ME in the first place! 
When we were waiting for the police, he told me that he had 3 other witnesses to me cussing at him, which I perceived as another threat. There was a young woman from an eastern European country that stared at me while nodding her head, as if to say that she will back him up, as well as an African American male that was there to reroute bags. 

I bought all first class tickets on Delta, and have literally had the WORST experience of my life! I understand that sometimes things happen, but this is COMPLETELY unacceptable and utterly disgusting behavior. 
I would like a formal apology, and there needs to be service recovery done on Delta's part for the utterly appalling behavior in which I have been subjected, both on my way to Montréal and back home to San Diego. 

I am also suggesting Anger Management training for the manager that yelled and threatened me, because I am sure that as a worldwide organization that Delta is not supporting the aggressive tactics that are being practiced in the San Diego baggage claim office. 

At this point, I will now lose more sleep waiting for my bag to arrive at my home, to which I am skeptical that it will even arrive after this vile incident.

You really need some counseling because the length and tone of this post reads like that of a person who has difficulty dealing with frustration and conflict.\n\n2. I have experienced so many problems and delays on Delta Connection flights to and from Canada (mostly YUL and YYZ) that I have stopped booking them. Delta also flies real Delta operated B717s on the ATL-YUL and ATL-YYZ routes and I will only book those. I have complained many times (much more constructively than you) to Delta about the Delta Connection problems and they've actually called me to let me know that lots of people are complaining about this. Apparently they have an existing contract on those routes that needs to run out. The crux of my complaints is that Comair, ExpressJet, et. al. Employees are inexperienced, poorly trained and often have a poor attitude. The CRJs (which are made in Montreal coincidentally) have way too many mechanical problems and the connection carriers do not handle it well. In my conversations with Delta they acknowledge this and are working to resolve.\n\n3. You paid for First Class on a Delta Connection flight? Joke is on you. :("", 'I actually side with the airline for this one. You must be fun at parties.', 'I fly from Los Angeles to Montreal through Detroit on Delta regularly (I live between LA and MTL).

Your experience sounds like a true pain in the ass, but I agree with other posters here that a little bit of empathy with the employees during what was also a difficult time for them may have proved beneficial. Although I will agree that the gossiping amongst the flight attendants at the front of the plane during a delay also drives me nuts. I also find it unprofessional and would simply prefer a quiet atmosphere up there. However, nothing even a cheap pair of headphones wouldn\'t solve. I find this route on Delta to be fine and typically experience few, if any, issues. As others have said, the first class purchase for a Delta Connection flight (the leg from DTW to YUL) is essentially useless.

5,Best Delta Card Combos / Amex Platinum tips?,6,b3lcgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/b3lcgc/best_delta_card_combos_amex_platinum_tips/,17,1553165817.0,"Hi there, fellow Delta enthusiasts!

&#x200B;

My partner and I have recently switched our airline loyalty entirely over to Delta here in NYC. We currently have the American Express Platinum card, which has definitely come in handy for accessing Delta SkyClubs, as well as priority pass lounges. We recently were approved for the Delta Amex Platinum card, which is rather exciting. 

&#x200B;

I guess my main question is, are there any other cards you'd recommend for obtaining status quicker / easier with Delta? I don't think the Delta Reserve is worth it, especially considering we already own the Amex Platinum card. Unless someone can persuade us?

&#x200B;

Also, any tips on what first to do when we receive the Delta Amex Platinum card in order to maximize its full potential?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!","['The Reserve Card is the best IMO. If you spend $60,000 you get 30,000 MQM which gets you to Diamond faster. You get better fare class options on your free companion pass and get complimentary Sky Club access which you don’t get on the Delta Platinum. Since you already have Amex Platinum the Sky Club benefit is a wash for you. \n\n', 'If you want status the fastest, the Reserve, IF you can hit the spending thresholds. If the thresholds for the DL platinum are more reasonable, go with that. The main difference, for you, is going to be the BOGO first class rather than coach and the spending thresholds with the MQM boost. There are a couple others like small upgrade priority over others if you have status, but nothing major. ', 'What would you be giving up? You can still do points and miles with the Reserve card when purchasing tickets. You still get Sky Club access. I guess personally I am all about Delta points not Amex points. \n\nI earn between the card and travel over 200,000 MQMs a year and the excess roll over from year to year so I only need to keep up with my ticket spend to keep my Diamond status active but I exceed the ticket spend 2-3 times each year so that is not an issue either. ', 'a small double dip tip: when you receive the new card, sign up for SkyMiles Dining using that card number.', 'Delta Amex Reserve, thats the one you want. ', ""Right, this is why I'm having the exact same thoughts. Lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould we consider switching from the Platinum Amex to the Reserve? Combining the Reserve and Platinum Amex just equates to such a high amount of annual fees. Not sure we are really up for that. "", ""It seems the Platinum just has other perks such as PriorityPass, which has come in handy when accessing lounges in airports where Delta doesn't operate a SkyClub. I'm also not sure we travel as much as you. 200,000 MQMs is quite a bit. "", 'I would eliminate the Amex Platinum and consolidate to the Delta Reserve. Why have two annual fees.

6,Options when flight is cancelled,3,95c2nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/95c2nm/options_when_flight_is_cancelled/,15,1533680666.0,"Hello all. I'm hoping for some peace of mind for an upcoming flight I have. I am scheduled to fly nonstop CVG to PHL on Friday evening. I have recently found out that this particular flight has been getting cancelled a lot - 4 times out of the last 12, including the past 2 Fridays.

Right now my plans are to fly to Philadelphia, stay overnight with a friend, and take a train Saturday morning to NYC. Right now we have tickets for a Saturday 8pm Broadway show, but I was planning on also seeing a 2pm matinee.

Since my Friday evening flight is the last of the night to PHL (well, there is an American flight that leaves at the same time), what will my options be if this flight gets cancelled? Delta does not offer nonstop flights to PHL on Saturdays. Would it be possible for them to rebook me onto a flight to a New York airport instead, or does the rebooking have to be the same city? Would they be able to rebook on another airline (American has a Saturday super early AM flight to PHL)? 

I'm basically worried that my flight is going to be cancelled and that I'm not going to be able to get to NYC in time for all my plans. I guess it's not really the worst thing if I don't get there in time for a 2pm show (even though I really want to), but missing the 8pm show will put me out $240 because I have physical tickets so I won't even be able to transfer them to my friend so she can at least go.

And I know I may be worrying for nothing and my flight could be fine. But 33% cancellation is concerning, especially compared to the identical American flight which has been delayed a couple times but not cancelled at all.

Thank you for any insight you can provide! I don't fly often, just once per year or so, so I get really stressed out over it","['You should be fine.  I think those cancellations were due to weather and this Friday currently looks clear.', ""if it's cancelled, they probably will let you fly directly to NYC. if the app doesnt let you automatically rebook, you should be able to call and explain your plans and i imagine they can make that happen. "", ""If anyone is curious, my Friday flight was fine. Worried for nothing!\n\nHowever, coming back last night was a nightmare. 7pm departure pushed several times due to weather (fine, no problem). We eventually boarded at 8:50 and were told we'd be taking off in 15 minutes. Then at 9:10 they said we were waiting on paperwork. Then at 9:45 we finally had the paperwork, started to move, only to be told there was a huge number of planes waiting to take off so it would be at least 30 more minutes. Then at 10:30 we were told we were returning to the gate because something was wrong with the hydraulics. Around 11:20-11:30 we finally get back to the gate, and are told to go to another gate for our new plane. Take off around 12:15, landed at 1:30am, and I got home around 3:10am. At that point I would have taken a cancelled flight and compensation over a sleep deprived 45 minute drive home in the wee hours of the morning, but at least I made it.\n\nThe Delta employees were extremely nice the whole time, including the poor flight attendant who had to go through everything we were going through, but standing up. And the gate agent we had was wonderful. And luckily no passengers were screaming or yelling and making things worse."", ""Right now weather.com says thunderstorms at CVG Friday. That will change 90 times by then though. The problem is for this flight, Deltas response to weather seems to be to cancel it. American has a flight at the same time with the same weather and they've managed to take off every time Delta has cancelled. I don't mind a delay in that situation, but if American can fly and Delta can't then it seems like it's probably not just weather alone. "", ""Thank you. Hopefully this won't be an issue but I'm glad to hear that the policy allows for an airport change.\n\nFollow up question: if I do end up rerouted to New York will I be able to keep my return trip from Philadelphia or would I have to fly back from whichever airport I flew into?"", ""the other thing to note (about why the delta flight might be cancelled more often, and something you can look at on Friday) is that for a lot of the delta regional routes, they are flying planes zigzag across the country (i know as i fly NYC-PIT a lot).\n\nSo that can add problems when the plane is going from minneapolis, to indianapolis, to memphis, to DC, to CVG, to PHL, because bad weather or another issue in one of those places will cause a cascading effect (instead of if they just lopped back and forth from CVG to PHL you only haev to worry about 2 locations). \n\nyou can track your plane on flight aware to see where it's coming from (should go a few flights back) so even if the weather is looking good/bad in your two cities you can see if there might be other problems upstream. "", 'Weather.com is showing 20% showers on Friday.  Accuweather and weather underground both showing mostly clear.  The flight is operated by a vendor, specifically Endeavor Airlines.  I looked on flight aware and todays 5pm CVG-PHL is mainly operating flights on the east coast (PHL, BWI).  Flights that are generally cancelled due to weather is mainly because they can\'t get the required airplane to the departure airport, or they can\'t get flight crew to the departure airport or the the flight crew ""times out"" (has worked the maximum time that day allowed by the FAA or their union).  Another factor is the bases used by the airline for their flight crew.  Endeavor has crew bases in MSP, JFK, LGA, DTW and ATL.  Last Friday there were delays and cancellations on the east coast, so if the crew that is scheduled to work CVG-PHL is based on the east coast and can\'t get to CVG, that is one possible reason why the flight might be cancelled.  I looked at the AA flight (operated by a vendor, Piedmont Airlines).  Their flight today is routed ATL-DCA-CVG-PHL.  Now, this does not mean that is the routing of that aircraft every day, but it may be that Piedmont\'s cancellation rate is lower due to the location of their crew hubs and routing.  It isn\'t something that every Friday DL cancel\'s their CVG-PHL flight just because it is Friday, I think it is more likely due to weather issues over the past couple weeks.', 'i think return from philly would be defaulted as still intact, but you might be able to change it at that point if desired. YMMV', 'I had a similar thing happen recently. I was flying from RDU to PHL and the first leg of my trip was a flight to ATL that was significantly delayed, so I asked if I could get on a flight to a nearby airport, and they put me on a direct flight from RDU to EWR. They did not change my return ticket, and I flew out of PHL on my way back.\n\nAlso: if the gate is overly crowded with people also looking to get rebooked, etc, I recommend going to the Sky Club. To me, it was definitely worth the price of admission ($29 with the Delta AmEx) for the customer service that they gave me. I was immediately rebooked and then I had a nice lounge to hang out in before my flight.', 'I tracked it earlier. If I remember correctly it just goes between CVG, PHL, and BWI. So as long as those 3 cities have good weather I should hopefully avoid weather related delays', ""My weather.com is still showing 60% chance of storms Friday, but accuweather is clear. Not sure what's up with that. But 3 days out is too early to predict something like that anyway.\n\nThank you for the other info. I definitely assumed that since schedules stay the same day to day, the plane routes would as well. I know there is really nothing I can do about whether or not it gets cancelled. I'm just hoping to prepare for what happens if it does (including but not limited to driving through the night to get where I need to be, if all else fails). The good news is I won't have a checked bag so that's at least something I won't have to worry about"", ""I would like to keep the PHL return since I plan on going back to Philadelphia after the NYC excursion. So hopefully that wouldn't be an issue"", ""I'm getting pretty baffled by this flight. It was delayed over 2 hours last night, probably due to weather although it wasn't anything terrible. Today, I tracked the plane all day. It landed in CVG from BWI on time (early, actually), and then all of a sudden the CVG-PHL flight was delayed an hour and a half. So the plane is where it needs to be, no bad weather in CVG or PHL, no delay alerts at either airport due to weather/air traffic. I guess the flight crew isn't where they need to be?\n\nAt this point, so many flights have been getting cancelled out of CVG to the Northeast that I don't think I can risk trying to get a flight for Saturday. Last night they pre-emptively cancelled this morning's flights to EWR, PHL, and BWI. Other New York and PHL flights out of CVG have been cancelled today as well. If my flight is cancelled, I'm just going to have to start driving. At 9 hours, it will be miserable but possible. But if I gamble on a Saturday flight, and it gets cancelled or delayed, it will be too late to drive and I'll be SOL.\n\nI don't have a Delta AmEx, looks like the Sky Club pass is $59 in that case, but it says you have to buy the pass at the check in desk. Does that mean the Delta check in desk pre-security? Or is there, like, a Sky Club check in desk at the entrance to the Sky Club?"", 'They mean the front desk at the entrance to the Sky Club itself. If you want to go in, you just walk in and tell them and then pay. ', 'Thanks!']"

This year I will reach diamond status by the end of The month (May). My two questions/statements are:

1) I never get upgraded to first class flying out of Atlanta. That isn’t a broad statement, it is a fact. In 11 months as Platinum, I have not once been upgraded out of Atlanta. Is it reasonable to believe I will get upgraded once I hit diamond?

2) Does anyone fly delta for personal travel out of Atlanta? I booked a trip to Paris in May, 8 weeks ago. At the time, the cheapest Delta flight was $1261. I ended up booking American Airlines for $451. 

This appears to be common practice being based in Atlanta. I often have vendors flying with me from smaller cities, but connecting via atlanta. 9/10 times the vendor’s flight is $200 cheaper, yet we are on the same “main” flight. Effectively flying twice as many segments, but at a cheaper price.

13,An Open Letter Regarding Corporate Social Responsibility,0,81ugzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/81ugzs/an_open_letter_regarding_corporate_social/,9,1520154282.0,"To Whom It May Concern:




As regards the current state of affairs in which our collective State/Federal government/s and societal interest groups find themselves, I must say that I am truly not that surprised or unappreciative of the possibilities/opportunities that the political-economic system of the United States now affords us. I refer, of course, to the rising wave of organizational political consciousness that has sprung from some unforeseen depths following the tragic deaths of 17 persons on Feb. 14, 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Highschool in Parkland, Florida. 

This event has once again shaken the American public to depths of despair that are always of the most grievous of magnitudes. And once again, as the people come together to air their grievances publicly, clearly, and loudly to their government officials, they are met with open arms to extensive hearings, platitudes, assurances, and half-hearted measures drug forward and discussed by equally half-hearted legislators. It seems that we are doomed to waiting until the next mass-shooting to give it another shot.

But wait, amidst the dark and bleak routine in which we have found ourselves, something interesting rears its head: economic powerhouses such as Delta Airlines, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, MetLife, Symantec, et al. publicly, perhaps even brazenly, rebuking those who many within their stakeholder groups see as central to the gun crises of the United States. The subject of the collective ire is, who else, but the National Rifle Association (NRA); an organization that has spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars obstructing and repealing legislature aimed at preventing these tragedies and many others like them from happening in the first place. 

Now, this is not some rant about how we “need to bring down the NRA and those money-grubbing politicians who support them” or anything of the sort. Frankly, I truly cannot blame the NRA membership for exercising their Constitutional Rights to collective reasoning, discussion, and representation (i.e. founding/joining interest groups) and allowing the organization to represent and bargain for them in the political arena. We all have these same Rights as both members of the United States of America as well as the greater human species and we all exercise them to whatever degree we see fit. We honestly cannot begrudge the NRA member for their membership as it is none of our business nor concern why they have entrusted their voice to and provided a platform to the NRA.

Similarly, I cannot blame the companies (and their many predecessors who forged ahead and stood against societal ailments, wrongs, and barriers before them) for doing as they are and removing policies regarding politically contentious/sensitive organizations. As organizations, and people themselves , these companies are exercising their own Rights to express themselves as they see fit.

Some companies, of which Delta  seems to be the most recent and sharply relevant example, experience the costs and penalties associated with breaking the norms and mores of the special interest group—business/economic enterprise—legislative bargaining policy-making dynamic (Figure: 1) that exists in contemporary neoliberal economies. 

Costs come in many forms and can never truly be predicted when an organization takes a risk and publicly acts against a powerful special interest. For some, it means simply losing face in the endless war of public opinion and for others it may mean losing suppliers or a shifting customer base. For some though, that risk results in a not insubstantial and immediate legislative blowback in the form of a $40-million tax break being shredded by Georgia State lawmakers.

This is where things get truly interesting. For, as collaboratively devastating and hopeful as this collective chain of events has been in terms of the “debate” on guns in the United States, it still wasn’t anything new up to this point. There are serious implications and social precedents being set in this rapidly unfolding story. When legislators decide to throw a thinly-veiled fit and trash an economically feasible and widely-favored proposal over a perceived political opinion/action, they send a dangerous message (read: threat) to any organizations who wish to exercise their right to political speech contrary to larger benefactors.

The legislative response to Delta’s policy change, escalates tensions between legislators and their business-counterparts by drawing a proverbial line in the sand and standing squarely behind a wall of implied-consequence. It is an intriguing and unforeseen move by the legislators and it can truly be interpreted only one way by business leaders: this is the point where conversation ends. Delta Airlines has now become an example of the limits of governmental patience when dealing with organizational speech. 

There is, however, an obvious problem here in that as long as these legislators are acting in their capacities as elected representatives, they are making decisions in the name and interest of their respective constituencies. Their sabre-rattling is therefore that of their voters and we now must ask: who are the constituents of these politicians? Their electorates or their economic benefactors?

And although I don’t truly buy the “politically divisive nature” argument Delta, you are doing the right thing in instigating a movement to disassociate business interests, legislative organs, and special interest groups in the United States. The fact is that these relationships have just gotten a little too cozy in recent years. Just look at the business-political “revolving-door” if you aren’t quite sure of the problem. And sure, it is good for them to get along and be friendly, but a good friend also lets you know when something needs to be addressed. In Delta et al.’s public disassociation with the NRA, they are doing just that.

It is my hopes, as well as why I have written this open letter, that this inspires a larger trend among business lobbies. Now that legislators have very openly shown the new game that is to be played, I implore organizations to begin to take similar stands across all industries and socio-political stances. You cannot allow yourselves to be subjected to the will and blackmail of vindictive legislators who act according to those with the largest checkbook. And in the name of “not taking sides” in the political turmoil of the United States of America, you must openly declare who it is that you are not aligned with. You, and companies like you, are some of the most powerful players in the court of public opinion and it is time you start utilizing that influence.

If this does not sufficiently appeal to your sense of corporate social responsibility, let me offer some economic incentives as well. This is largely a battle of public opinion and as the clever business-people you are, you know that perception is a key driver to profits and long-term economic viability. Understanding and anticipating the needs, wants, and expectations of customers is the name of the game and right now, the public is clearly saying one thing: “it is time to act on gun safety in the USA.” 

Now while the singular act of removing the NRA discount was largely symbolic and likely will have limited impacts for Delta, it adds to a collection of actions that collaboratively change the image of an organization in the eyes of the public. By working together across industries and contexts, large companies can profit simply by not being a competitor. And while everyone wishes that political stance/affinity wasn’t a primary driver in consumer decisions, we all know that it is. 

Therefore, I think all of us (both organization and consumer alike) should think very long and hard about what the Delta-Georgia-NRA fiasco is telling us about the current state-of-affairs in the legislative halls of the United States of America. Legislators are not only clearly showing their bias, they are openly acting upon it in their capacities as representatives. Meanwhile organizations who appeal to public opinion (inadvertently or otherwise) are publicly chastised for doing so. 

The social context in which this has taken place is definitively tragic. The easily preventable deaths of 17 human beings and the terrorization of countless others should never be the engine by which we achieve legislative change; the fact that we find ourselves in this position again is frankly sickening and that we are still having this conversation is akin to psychological torment. 

Companies: take this opportunity to affect real change across our great country. For those economic conglomerates out there, what benefit do you stand from “remaining neutral?” 

The root of the problem is systemic. The sickness may be symptomized in the lawmakers, but its causes lie deep within our socio-political cultures and socio-legal structures. And while I am aware of the legal and political implications of limiting political spending (i.e. “speech” ), we must find ways to make the effects proportionate across parties and stakeholders if we are to maintain the legitimacy of and trust in our governmental processes. The threat of legislative blackmail through virtually unrestricted political spending by disproportionately influential interest groups and PACs is a threat to everyone’s security, well-being, and opportunity.

The airline industry is experiencing strong financial performance — [Delta Air Lines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DAL) recently hit a record stock price, and [United Airline Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UAL) grew profits in its latest earnings as the U.S. economy continues its decade-long run.

In fact, airline industry conditions are so good, longtime airline-stock hater Warren Buffett of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BRK.A) became one of the sector’s biggest investors in recent years after a wave of consolidation brought the fleets closer to the almost monopoly conditions he looks for in businesses.

But other recent highs in air travel are not so positive: Airports all over the country are setting new records in monthly passenger levels, making the airport experience one of the worst “legs” in a traveler’s journey. As a result, major airlines flush with money for reinvestment are making the on-the-ground experience a greater focus of their efforts to out-compete rival carriers.

“I think the next area of competition in air travel is in the airport,” Paul Jacobson, executive vice president and CFO of Delta said at the [CNBC @Work Human Capital + Finance conference](https://www.cnbc.com/work/) in Chicago last Tuesday. “How do you continue to streamline the on-the-ground experience. It is a big part of how passengers rate the experience.”

In major metro areas the two biggest issues in airport satisfaction are access to the airport (with so many major airports far from city centers) and the terminal itself, at No. 1, according to J.D. Power.

“The most common PR headline from any airport any month is ‘X airport sets new monthly passenger record,’” said Mike Taylor, J.D. Power’s travel practice leader.

But that does not necessarily mean it is good PR with so many airports so dated.

 

There are some aspects of the airport experience that airlines can’t do anything about. Only 6% more airports have been built in the U.S. since 1980, despite 181% more domestic passengers.

“They can’t build another four-lane highway to the airport,” Taylor said. “Most of the airports are shoehorned into areas never meant to handle this much traffic.”

Those problems don’t end once at the airport, either: Many parking lots closest to terminals at some of the busiest U.S. airports are now completely full and closed on multiple days per week. This is the type of on-the-ground frustration that leads to missed flights, and missed flights lead to the blame being placed all around.

“People are more stressed on the airport and airlines side of things, and they blame both,” Taylor said.

For the airlines like Delta, it does not matter that some of the terminal experience is beyond their control. Taylor said that when an aircraft closes and sits on the ground because the FAA is holding them there, passengers do not complain about the FAA. “They paid the airline, and they pick up the cocktail napkin and swear at it.”

Scott Mayerowitz, executive editorial director of travel information site The Points Guy, said the airport experience is unique in the travel journey as being so bad, and it is an important part of the journey that is underexamined. “Until my head hits the pillow in a hotel room, I am on the go, and it all matters,” Mayerowitz said.

Delta is collecting as much data as it can from passengers to improve the travel experience. [“We survey everything,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/whats-the-most-stressful-part-of-your-trip-delta-wants-to-know.html) Jacobson told those attending the CNBC event in Chicago. “A lot of that comes down to the psychology of the customer and understanding what each leg in the journey makes the customer feel like.”

## Wall Street is watching

Wall Street is focusing more on the airport experience in its analysis of airline stocks. Hunter Keay, a Wolfe Research analyst who covers Delta, wrote that the Delta CFO is correct in his focus on the airport as a competitive key. Keay wrote in a late 2018 research note that Delta’s major investment in “investment-starved airports” like New York City’s LaGuardia “are not so much an act of generosity but a strategic decision that we believe will further widen DAL’s competitive advantage to peers by driving up costs for marginal competitors there that lack scale, pricing power, or both. ... This is literally a 20-year competitive advantage DAL is building today, arguably the hardest one yet for competitors to copy.”

Delta is investing $12 billion over a five-year period investing in its airport infrastructure, primarily at New York City’s LaGuardia, Los Angeles International, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

“Airports have always been a challenge for airlines who haven’t been able to crack that code due to more pressing capital needs internally, fear of committing to longer-term, big dollar projects due to business cycle risk with questionable balance sheets, or the challenges of driving buy-in or consensus with the government agencies that run these airports. But it seems to us that DAL is figuring this thing out,” Keay wrote.

One of the terminal chokepoints where Delta made an investment is through a stake it owns in biometric screening company Clear. Jacobson pointed to the Clear investment as part of its efforts to streamline the passenger experience through investments in technology. “We’ve made big bets in technology in the past few years thinking we can turn it around into revenue generation,” the Delta CFO said at the CNBC event. Jacobson said technology like Clear should ultimately improve the experience beyond the security checkpoint.

“I think ultimately the technology around identification, whether facial recognition or fingerprints, is coming to all transactions,” Jacobson said.

“Delta has recognized that security is a horrible headache for people,” Mayerowitz said. “[Clear is at many more airports](https://www.clearme.com/where-we-are/?p=GOOGBRAEX&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwmtDpBRAQEiwAC6lm4_5SRPJeH1iXNFpzLmr3hK4Db775gDPmp55sLlbhgVcATBnYKT0vjxoCr-EQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) than before because of the Delta investment, and they’ve done saturation at their key hubs. ”

Mayerowitz, who is a Clear member, added, “In two to three minutes at LGA or JFK, I can make it from the curb to the other side of security. Clear gets me to the front of the precheck line, and I just put my bag in and walk through and I’m done.”

## The timing is right for airlines

A focus on future revenue is one of the reasons why Delta is making the investments now, before a recession hits and operating conditions weaken.

Yael Taqqu, a senior partner at management consultant McKinsey, who spoke on a panel with Jacobson at CNBC’s @Work Human Capital + Finance conference, said investments like the ones Delta is making now are designed to be “revenue enhancements” out ahead of the next downturn. “In a downturn, the wedge between digital haves and have nots, which is already wide, will get wider,” said Taqqu.

Taylor said the timing is right from an airline industry perspective too. “You have to have three things happen to really expand airports. The economy has to be good, the airline has to be making money, and policies have to be right. These days, we have all three of them working in the airlines favor. ... When they are not making money, those things get put on hold. They would like to have everything set up for the passenger to be happy before getting on the craft.”

Airlines also are running out of ways to improve and “disaggregate” — price-tier — the in-cabin experience.

“Right now airlines have healthy profits and are reinvesting,” Mayerowitz said. “Delta likes to brag that they have the most inflight seatback TVs of any airline, and they’ve built a business around what they say is a superior product in the sky, and it commands a revenue premium, people willing to spend $10-$15 extra. But at the end of the day, there is only so much you can do to increase costs in the sky.” He added of Delta’s focus on the terminal, “They are right, especially as airlines cram more seats into planes and come up with hideous slim-line bathrooms just so they can get an extra row of seats in.”

Delta is among the airlines that have cut down bathroom size in some cabins to add an extra back row.

Some of the on-the-ground improvements won’t be available to all passengers — in fact, they are designed to find ways within the terminal to extract greater revenue and reward elite levels of passengers.

“Space dedicated to lounges will continue to grow,” Taylor said. “They are looking for more space in which to hand out perks and do the same thing as they are doing in the cabin ... and trying to monetize some of it.”

Mayerowitz, who holds 19 credit cards offering access to many different terminal lounges, said that frequent flyers need better club options because classic lounges at big city terminals can often be “packed.”

Lounge investment is not limited to the airlines. [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AXP) has its own series of luxury lounges for elite car holders, the Centurion Lounge. “Centurion has really upped the game in design and food offering,” Mayerowitz said.

Airlines including American Airlines and United (Polaris Lounge) have added multiple-tiers of lounges in addition to the classic options (e.g. AA’s Admirals Club).

“The lounge is crowded for most of these airlines and they are trying to differentiate it. ... If you’re paying $10,000 for a one-way flight, you better be getting something better than a $450 traveler on the same trip. That’s why they have separate entrances for check in,” Mayerowitz said. He added that international travel already features some of these perks, but a passenger flying domestic will has not historically seen this level of service except to limited cross-country routes.

Luxury perks also have extended to travel between terminals. United offers Mercedes Benz cars for elite passengers that need to transfer between terminals for ground connections, a perk that Mayerowitz says can make quite an impression. “Elite members are whisked in these luxury cars around big planes to their next flights.”

Delta offers Porsches; [American Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAL) uses Cadillacs.

All the airlines will spend “multi billions of dollars,” in all, Taylor said.

Better food offerings and private dining on demand for top-tier travelers is coming. “Why have cheese cubes and crackers at the lounge when you can pay for fresh made?” Mayerowitz said. His credit card collections makes sure he always has options and he is seeing more of the benefits as lounges improve.

“I was just in Las Vegas and went to a lounge, got in thanks to my Chase Sapphire Reserve card, and it was great. Nice views and good snacks and a perfect place to unwind before heading out on the next part of my journey.”

But there are limits to how far the airport improvement era can take the passenger.

Mayerowitz is not getting his hopes up too much. “Airports are just pretty bus terminals. There is only so much you can do.”","['I’d say offering lounge access to first class domestic passengers like Alaska would be nice. It’d be different than AA and UA. I’d honestly pay a little more for that.', 'I wish Seattle would improve the TSA wait times, fucking joke', ""I'm really surprised this isn't a thing. I hope the right people are looking at it, but I agree that it seems like it would differentiate from AA/UA. Maybe they don't want to drastically increase the number of people coming into the Sky Clubs?"", 'Get Clear', 'Could always make them bigger. Delta does have a more premium feel in the cabin than AA.

I just couldnt deal with AA and their horrible pricing and cabins, the max, the delays. If delta did lounge access they could build more lounges, or make some bigger, I’d only use them.', 'Yeah was thinking about that but I don’t fly out late enough to justify the yearly price.

But it seems like AA has an Ops team that just has no clue what’s going on. 

Recent Example: (but this happens all the time and I’ve heard it from others):
Local airport tells me I should be able to make my connection in PHL because the regional is on its way and should be here shortly. Yet, I see the inbound hasn’t moved from taxing in 15 minutes. 

Then inbound the aircraft misses GPS lock and diverts up to ROC. Again, the ground crew insists the aircraft will be there any moment and other preparatory announcement are made. 

I know more about what’s going on by watching Flight24 than the AA staff do. 

I then get notices that we will depart an hour from now - never mind that the ROC bound aircraft hasn’t even landed in ROC yet. 

5 updates later, the departure time has skewed like four hours. 

This happens ALL. THE. TIME. with American. 

Meanwhile Delta, when there are issues, manages to keep PAX updated with proper times.   And more often than not Delta flies without an issue.

All of my colleagues chose the SWA direct flight rather than having a connection. Well I am chasing platinum and not just gold this year, so it’s worth it right? and I had been upgraded on both segments, so even more reason to stick with it.

Well, after a several hour delay in Sacramento, it was obvious I was going to miss the connection in LAX, which was the last flight of the day. If I took the first flight the next day from LA, was still going to miss my meeting.  The gold desk didn’t have any help for me other than to try and make it to LA and then reassess. If i was going to miss the meeting, might as well go back to ATL. The gate agent was sympathetic.

She worked with American to get my on its nonstop. The AA flight was also delayed, so i could make it, but because it was delayed it was showing as unavailable (already departed in Delta system).  She transferred me to AA for next morning first flight, and then worked with AA gate agent to move the trip up to it’s delayed flight.  This was dreamwork. Unfortunately, the ticket was stuck in limbo out of the Delta system, but not yet showing up in the AA system. The AA flight had to shut its door before the ticket came through. Missed the flight. Disappointing, but I feel like both airlines genuinely tried, just not enough minutes. 

They had to issue my ticket back to Delta. The gold desk was going to send me to LAX to try and go standby to ATL.

* **Partnership brings together the leading airlines in North America and Latin America, connecting the Americas to the world as never before.**
* **Together, Delta and LATAM will hold the leading position in five of the top six Latin American markets from the U.S.**
* **Together, the partners will serve 435 destinations worldwide and carry more passengers between North America and Latin America than any other partnership.**
* **Customers will benefit from significantly expanded travel choices across the Americas and an industry leading customer experience.**

Delta and LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (“LATAM”) today announced that they have entered into a strategic partnership that for the first time combines the strengths of the leading airlines in North and Latin America.

“This transformative partnership with LATAM will bring together our leading global brands, enabling us to provide the very best service and reliability for travelers to, from and throughout the Americas,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our people, customers, owners and communities will all benefit from this exciting platform for future growth.”

“This alliance with Delta strengthens our company and enhances our leadership in Latin America by providing the best connectivity through our highly complementary route networks,” said Enrique Cueto Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of LATAM. “We look forward to working alongside one of the world’s best airlines to enhance the travel experience for our passengers.”

The strategic partnership will unlock new growth opportunities, building upon Delta’s and LATAM’s global footprint and joint ventures worldwide, including Delta’s existing partnership with Aeroméxico. With their complementary networks, Delta, LATAM and their partners will be able to offer access to a greatly expanded array of worldwide destinations. Together, the partnership will provide greater customer convenience, a more seamless travel experience and better connect customers with the rest of the world.

Additional details of the partnership include:

* Delta will invest $1.9 billion for a 20 percent stake in LATAM through a public tender offer at $16 per share, to be funded principally with newly issued debt and available cash.
* Delta will also invest $350 million to support the establishment of the strategic partnership.
* Delta will acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and has agreed to assume LATAM’s commitment to purchase 10 additional A350 aircraft to be delivered beginning in 2020 through 2025, supporting Delta’s ongoing fleet transformation.
* Delta will be represented on LATAM’s Board of Directors, further strengthening the relationship.
* The tender offer and the strategic partnership are subject to customary closing conditions and all required governmental and regulatory approvals, including anti-trust immunity.

Delta expects that the transaction will be accretive to EPS over the next two years. In addition, the transaction will not impact the company’s existing financial commitments to shareholders, including free cash flow and shareholder returns. Delta also expects to remain within targeted leverage ratios.

For LATAM, the transaction will improve free cash flow generation, reduce forecasted debt by over $2 billion by 2025 and improve LATAM’s capital structure, enhancing its ability to execute its long-term strategy.
