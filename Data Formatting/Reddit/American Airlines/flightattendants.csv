I\'ve heard people\'s hiring timelines taking them 3 weeks to almost 2 months. As I am waiting for a response as well, I have a feeling that those applying within this time frame is in the ""2-month"" crowd.\n\nI did notice that they are still open to receiving applications as of August 16, 2019.

I will keep you posted as well.', 'It took 10 days after submitting the application to receive the invitation for a video interview.  2 weeks after the video interview I received my rejection email.\n\nI honestly don’t even think they look at resumes this early in the process.  I think all those who pass the assessment will be invited for a video interview.  The reason being is that the VI does an excellent job of weeding out a vast majority of applicants.

1,Sooo I'm running out of airlines,6,60birs,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/60birs/sooo_im_running_out_of_airlines/,29,1489976678.0,"Hey guys so for the past 6-7 months I've been siting on flightattendantcareer and have been applying applying applying to airlines to be a flight attendant and I'm running out of airlines to apply for. What airlines do you recommend? Or what airlines do you recommend as a good airline to get my feet wet, or at least in the air? Not some super strict I'll lose my job airline. These are the airlines I've applied to:
United- had a f2f 6 months ago, so my time is coming back around
Frontier-rejected
Republic-VI (didn't do)
Virgin America- VI rejected
Delta- VI Archived.. Whatever that means
American Airlines- rejected
Skywest- couldn't make the hiring fair
Horizon- f2f rejected
Alaska- f2f rejected (but told me they'd recommend me to Horizon.. not sure if they meant recommend to apply or recommend me to the hiring team)

Edit: I currently work at a bank and have a wrist tattoo so I understand professionalism but not sure if that plays a factor in deciding airlines.
 
Also I've heard Omni and Envoy are good airlines","[""If the wrist tattoo was visible in your American interview, I guarantee that was the problem. That's my airline and they're pretty strict about that. But if it's hidden by a sleeve or watch or makeup then you're good. \n\nAlso try Mesa. They hired my friend from a video interview only. "", 'F2F interviews - If your tattoo has been visible at all during these interviews I can guarantee that\'s why you\'ve been rejected.  Most (if not all) airlines will tell you that you are not allowed to use makeup and bandaids to cover tattoos, and wrist tattoos are a no-go because you will be reaching up to close bins and it will become visible.  Does your watch cover it?  Or if you feel like taking the risk you can cover it with makeup for the interview (Kat Von D has a nice tattoo concealer), but be prepared to have it covered up whenever you are at work.\n\nAs for the airlines you\'ve been straight up rejected from - this is all a numbers game.  They receive thousands of applications for just a few spots.  Double check your resume and cover letters.  Is everything formatted correctly?  Spelled correctly?  Did you put Airways where you should have put Airlines? (Or Air Lines - lookin\' at you Delta).  Make some small edits and when your 6 month timeline is up try again.  I know people who tried for years before they finally got hired, 7 months might feel like forever but it isn\'t actually that long.\n\nAnyway, now for airlines you haven\'t tried yet (though I have no idea if they\'re hiring right now or not):  JetBlue, Allegiant, Spirit, Southwest, Envoy, PSA, Endeavor, ExpressJet, Trans States, Mesa, Compass, Air Wisconsin, Piedmont.  I\'m probably forgetting a few more.  You can try Emirates and Etihad, but I can guarantee you that you will not get through with a tattoo on your wrist.\n\nAnyway, keep trying.  Good luck.  There\'s a facebook page called Flight Attendant Career Connection which might have some helpful information - but whatever you do do not fall for any of the ""coaching"" and ""resume writing"" the girl offers.  That bitch is just trying to make money off of you and she is useless.', ""Southwest, JetBlue, WestJet, Canada Air/Air Georgian. \n\nHave they said why they're rejecting you? Seems odd to me to have interviewed with so many and have been rejected so many times. \n\nI know pilots cannot have visible tattoos, so it's possible the same is true for FAs (source, husband is a pilot). Is it small enough to be covered by a bandaid? The good news is tattoos and piercings are becoming so common that companies are being forced to change their policies. \n\nEdit: removed and added some suggestions. "", ""If you're getting more rejections than interviews then maybe it's time to reevaluate what you're turning in aka your resume/cover letter. "", ""Try Allegiant. Not sure when they're hiring, but I've got a bunch of co-workers with wrist tattoos. Just make sure it's covered during the interview. "", 'In addition to the other airlines already mentioned, JetBlue will open applications on April 1. ', ""I would wear long sleeve and cover your tattoo. You should be able to raise your hand and the tattoo still not be visible after your sleeve rides up. \n\nMy advice is don't give up! I got 6 job interviews before being offered a job at skywest. Not to mention all the time spent applying and not getting a f2f. Practice your STAR answers (situation, task, action, result)."", ""My friends at Hawaiian love it. They won't hire if a tattoo is visible. Best of luck!"", ""I know a lot of people have already said it, but definitely the tattoo. For the few regional airlines I interviewed at the said no tattoos on your arms, and covering it up doesn't work. One recruiter said if you get it completely layered off, then you can reapply. "", ""I didn't even get a VI from them"", 'Haha. The people on that page seem to rave about her coaching. What have you heard otherwise? ', ""They're kinda bigger than my watch but I also wear asking colored sleeve to cover them. I've never had a problem with them showing before and I wear a suit everyday, but I do understand the whole lifting into the bins everyday.\n\nAwesome thank you so much for the insight. I heard Mesa and Spirit are the worst. Do you have any insight on those? Yeah I don't use those I can learn everything everywhere else with spending money "", 'PSA is still around? Huh.', ""They haven't which is odd to me too, I'm great with customer service, I just think it might be during the interview I'm not as thorough with my answers or they're not strong enough.\n\nWell sadly most airlines still say you can't have them or cover them up. Ive heard some airlines will send you home during an interview just for tattoos "", 'Thank you so I much I was looking into them, they seem like a cool regional', ""I know makeup and bandaids aren't really appropriate but how about skin colored sleeves? Has anybody said anything against those before? That's what I usually wear when I'm working at the bank. And they just look like athletic sleeves except tan"", 'She\'s a fucking idiot who ""knows so much"" about getting hired by multiple airlines...because she got fired from multiple airlines.  Anyone can google how to improve their resume and interview skills.  She gouges people for money.  Last I saw was $30/half hour of coaching.  Seriously, $1 a minute?  ', ""I hear Spirit has really good benefits and perks for its employees. They also fly to a variety of destinations internationally like in the Caribbean and such. I'm not sure if they're extremely senior trips and I heard someone quip that they don't always layover  in those places but I'm not sure if that's true. It seems from what I've gathered the people who have joined spirit really love the company and the people despite what the public reputation is. "", ""Unfortunately I don't know much about Mesa or Spirit, I've never worked for either of them.  I just know that if you really want to start flying it doesn't hurt to get your foot in the door somewhere, so you can prove to the mainline carriers that you're capable of handing the schedule and lifestyle."", 'I think so.  I could be wrong.  Still, worth looking into in the chance that they are still around.\n\nEdit:  Yup, just checked.  Still operating as a regional for American.', ""If your interview is weak learn the STAR method because you won't get the job without a solid interview. The competition is too stiff."", ""Not a regional, just an unconventional ultra low cost airline. They get to be home every night in their home base, so it's really different from other airlines. Lots of people work for them for a year and then get hired at other airlines. Tattoos on the wrist are ok as long as they are covered with long sleeves, bandaids, or makeup. \n\n(Source: I work for them ;))"", ""😂 that honestly sums up how I feel about that group sometimes. So if anyone reading hasn't joined and is thinking of joining, be warned. "", 'Lmao everybody needs a side hustle these days', ""Makes perfect sense :) thank you. All my FA friends say don't settle but I mean I don't mind it if it'll look better for me"", ""Yeah, we're not quite a regional. I've honestly gotten a bit spoiled by being home every night. I'm not sure I'd want to work for anyone else. I've seen a bunch of G4 FAs leave for bigger airlines. /u/jillianjo actually answered a bunch of questions for me back before I applied!"", ""Awesome thank you so much, as soon as they start to hire I'll put the app in :)"", '^_^']"

I’ve been accepted into the American Airlines Cadet Academy, and will be moving from LA to Memphis with my soon-to-be-wife to begin the flight school towards becoming an airline transport pilot. I didn’t think it would be hard, walking away from this job with all the stresses and management problems I experienced during my time with the company, but as I walked in to the crew room and turned in my crew badge, KCM card and company phone, the reality of it all was unexpectedly emotional. Being a flight attendant was one of the greatest seasons of my life and I will miss all my friends and colleagues that I got to work with over the years!","[""I didn't go to the aa Cadet academy but I left being an FA to be a pilot after 9 years.

', ""I can't speak for how difficult it is because I never did the academy but that being said I would finish your degree now and get into flight school after doing both things at the same time it's very difficult and time-consuming."", 'I don’t believe it’s a requirement but certainly helps in your interview process. The AA Cadet Academy is very competitive it their selection process and I’ve heard that becoming a pilot without a 4 year degree can be very challenging.', 'Thanks! I’m moving to Memphis in just a couple of weeks to start!', '27!', 'I got about 65 hours logged. Don’t have my license though but I’ve completed all of my solo work and everything that is necessary for a check ride and exam!', 'Hmmm that’s a bit of a complex answer. I loved my colleagues. The job itself is easy, so long as you’re flexible with hours and have a thick skin for certain passengers. Working at a mainline legacy carrier like United certainly has its perks and drawbacks. Since they’re a large airline, the pay for flight attendants are competitive, and you have a large pool of reserves that scheduling can pull from. But since the airline is so old, the seniority margin is MASSIVE. You have new hires with virtually 0-1 years, to people with 50+ years. This means that the time it takes from transitioning from reserve to holding a line at some bases like LAX can take over 20 years which, for me, is not sustainable for a career.\n\nBeing a flight attendant was an amazing experience and I got to see parts of the world that I never would have otherwise been able to experience and I did love the job. Though the pay cap is not what I desire as a career. With United, the pay starts at around $25/hr and caps out at around $64/hour after 10 years. Those aren’t the exact numbers but it’s close. It’s definitely not bad pay, but not what I desire for raising a family and living at the quality of life I hope to have. \n\nPros:\nSee the world, family gets travel benefits.\nEasy job.  Beverage cart, first class service, announcements, baggage assistance during boarding and deplaning, etc. It’s the same job no matter where you’re going (plus a couple of extra responsibilities to international destinations)\nFun, easy going colleagues (for the most part lol)\nDiscounts on virtually all travel related expenses\nBeing a large airline, they offer great benefits packages.\n\nCons:\nUpper management is AWFUL. I’ve worked for many large Fortune 500 corporations in the past and United’s practices from the top have been the worst I’ve seen. Don’t let them screw you over. KNOW YOIR CONTRACT and don’t back down if the company tries to violate it. You will be contractually protected from any repercussions. \nReserve life. It can be exhausting. Imagine getting a 2AM call for a 5AM report time after just working a 4 day trip and you’ve barely had 10 hours of rest at home. This doesn’t always happen but it will occasionally so be prepared for that.\nSeniority. It’s everything with the airlines and United’s seniority is massive. It can take many years before you can get off reserve and hold a line at some bases.\n\nI’m sure I will think of some more to add to this later on but this is what I have for now. Let me know if you have any more questions!', ""It ain't cheap but it's fast"", 'Negative', 'Thank you so much for responding!! This was super helpful, i had no idea that the upper management could be that way. Did you have a rough time paying rent your first year? I guess what i wanna know is if you were able to sustain yourself on the starting salary. I plan on moving out of my parents house when i become a flight attendant, hopefully at 20 years old. thanks again!!', 'Rent CAN be difficult, especially if you are assigned a base in a city that is not your home, and have to pay for a crash pad or apartment. I personally was able to sustain myself thanks to extra savings that I had accumulated. The most difficult part for most people is actually during training, which takes 4-5 weeks to complete, and you’re not really making much money during that stint. I believe that you’re given a weekly stipend of $100 or something but it’s not much to live on. After graduating training, I was assigned a to the San Francisco base, which if you’re aware of the city, has some of the highest costs of living in the world. I found a crash pad for $350 per month, which I was barely able to afford with my income and savings. Thankfully I was awarded a base transfer back to my home in LA after 8 months just as my savings were drying up and no longer had to pay for a crash pad. It’s great that you’re wanting to start so early, however I’d recommend looking into how old you have to be to be a flight attendant. I believe the youngest is either 20 or 21 in the US. Either way, you’re starting young and will have plenty of seniority accumulated by the time you’re 30, which by that time, you will have maxed out your pay and will be making great money. I wish I had started that early! Also, you can start training before your minimum age requirement, so long as your birthday is before your graduation date. That was the case for one of my classmates.', ""Thanks again for the great info! Yeah AA u have to be 20 and united is 21 and I plan on applying for both of them (and others but I mainly want to work for one of those 2) because they both have bases close to where I live. And wow so I can apply at 19 as long as i turn 20 before grad day? This is the first I'm hearing that you can do that! Definitely will do that. Thanks!"", 'That is how it is at United but I’m not sure about how it is at AA. Good luck with everything!', 'Thank you!']"
4,What are some major differences between FA jobs at Asian airlines vs. and those at North American airlines?,10,6iszxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/6iszxg/what_are_some_major_differences_between_fa_jobs/,21,1498161330.0,,"[""I'm an FA for American \n\nWife has worked for ANA, now works for United(she was customer service/translator at ORD worked closely with ANA FAs).\n\nFor the Japanese carriers vs American the differences are huge.\n\nFirst understand that the Japanese service industry is very much customer oriented even at the expense of the persons soul(I've also worked in Japan as well for 6 years).\nThis has given Japanese airlines very high marks.  ANA has had the 5 Star rating and has earned it.  Flown both their business and economy class.  \n\nJapanese FAs are 90%+ small cute Japanese ladies and they will bend over backwards to serve your every whim.\nVs\nAmerican Airlines which will certainly try hard but we won't break ourselves in the process.\n\nCulturally it's totally normal for the service industry to work themselves to death to meet and end.  Which is great if you are on the receiving end.  Not so much if you are working.  \nMy wife and I were both much happier working for an American based airlines. \nBut if you ever get the chance to fly with ANA be sure to take it.

I’m anxious awaiting to hear back from two interviews.

I’m currently in the interviewing process with both Mesa Airlines and American Airlines. I’m aspiring to be a flight attendant as it’s been a dream of mine since forever.

I filled out my application with Mesa, did a video interview and then a group/F2F interview a week ago, I’m really hoping to get a CJO to join training at the end of March. Like I literally can’t sleep at night awaiting this response.

I filled out my application with AA and did a video interview a week ago, nothing yet. I’m not feeling as confident with AA as I am with Mesa but I’m also terrified of jinxing myself. Something has got to give.

I know no news is good news but just some hopeful words to help my patience would be great. This is killing me, my anxiety is sky high awaiting to know what is next.","['My advice is hope and pray you get hired at American.

9,Considering becoming a flight attendant,9,ao85io,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/ao85io/considering_becoming_a_flight_attendant/,17,1549600011.0,"Hi Everyone,

&#x200B;

I am a 21 yr old male, that is currently living in NJ and working in Finance (recently graduated college and started work). I am a bilingual American (Arabic mother tongue, and English) and conversational in Korean.

&#x200B;

Long Story short, while I think working in finance can sometimes be interesting and rewarding, I hate desk jobs and I'm thinking about becoming a flight attendant within 1-2 years. The main reason is because I feel like it will give me a good opportunity to explore the world while I'm young. Growing up I used to move to a new country every 3-4 years because my dad was switching jobs a lot, which allowed me to learn about different cultures and also made me enjoy travelling. 

&#x200B;

If I become a flight attendant, I would hope to work in an Asian airline where I can travel around Asia or an airline that has frequent routes to Asia like Qatar Airways, Emirates, etc. Mains reasons are due to the fact that I can converse in Korean (ideally I would be more fluent so I can use it in announcements on the flight, etc) and that I have fallen in love with Asian food. So whenever I have the chance, I go on a vacation to Korea/South east Asia. 

&#x200B;

In my head, becoming a flight attendants seems like a great way to travel around the world, try different foods and it seems less ""boring"" when compared to finance. I wonder if I am over-hyping the role.

&#x200B;

Also, as an American is it possible to work in Asian airline or are there restrictions?

Rn I'm a little lost, I don't need someone to hold my hand but hoping the people in this subreddit will give me a better idea of how realistic I'm being. And then after 1-2 years, I can come to the conclusion on whether or not to take the leap.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 ","[""Not to be completely in your business but how much money do you make in finance? You'll be taking (probably) a staggeringly large pay cut.\n\nTechnically as a FA yes, you travel, but you're working, and sometimes there's no time to go try different foods, unless it's the hotel you're ins version of a chicken sandwich. I can agree that it's probably less boring than finance, but if I was making (what I assume is) finance money, I can't see myself doing this. It's literally not even a lateral move.\n\nYou're probably better just going on more vacations. I'm not a FA because I love to travel and eat different foods, and I don't know anyone who's happy with this job based on that alone."", 'I\'m going to go through some of the not so pretty aspects...\n\nFirst and foremost are you a people person (truly)? Will you be okay with almost never hearing please/thank you and being demanded to do something for someone and doing it with a smile? Are you okay with people handing you their trash with no regard to what you\'re doing (ie: safety demo)? Are you good with eating near a LAV when you\'ve no time to grab food and eat it before your flight? Are you good with irregular operations and having your day extended from 10 hours to 15 hours with no warning and without complaining? Will it be acceptable to you to know that it will take a while (if ever) to establish a true social life outside of flying? Can you handle yourself financially in the beginning, because it will be pay cut, but flying can be lucrative. \n\nIf you answered yes to all of these, then go for it! Everything else is a piece of cake and rewarding. Traveling is a perk with a job. Most flight attendants will tell you most if the exploring they do is on their off days. Do you get to go out on overnights, sure and it\'s a blast, but it gets expensive fast and you\'re often exhausted. \n\nI would like to say additionally you don\'t just ""decide"" to become a flight attendant and it happens. It\'s a process. To give you an idea, I applied in March 2015, I got an action response email Feb 2016 and went to training May 2016. Sometimes it\'s faster, sometimes its longer. Roughly only 3% of flights attendant that apply are hired. Also, the airline you\'re applying to may not be accepting applications at the time you decide to take the leap, just something to keep in mind. \n\nYou sound ambitions, well cultured and open to change. I\'d say go for it if you think you can handle the not so glamorous side of this wonderful career. \n\nGood luck!', ""You seem to be a very desirable candidate. I'm not sure how it works if you're a US citizen and you'd like to work for another airline outside the US.\nIt is true that being a FA is a paycut compared to finance, but this job is amazing and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

Your language skills are a big bonus in getting hired. The starting pay is fairly abysmal, but it improves. Good luck!', '[deleted]', ""I make what around typical finance pay. Which is ~70k. I agree that it's a move that basically doesn't make sense. However, my goal going was never to go up the chain and become a manager or whatever. My goal was to learn about how companies run and potentially start my own thing (maybe even a restaurant if I can). Which is why culinary school/ working in a Kitchen is one of those idea. \n\nThis is a very rough idea that I have, so like I said I could be not making sense lol.

That step, while too early, is what I\'m trying to figure out. I have friends that taught English in Asia, some that did master degrees there and others that worked in Finance there. Since I\'d like to try living in South East Asia/Korea, becoming and English teacher or flight attendant is high on my list.

13,Whats my next best opportunity?,3,chjpdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/chjpdb/whats_my_next_best_opportunity/,15,1564062764.0,"Sooo my application for trainee flight attendant with American Airlines was rejected. Darn, but as it was my first attempt, I'm not totally heartbroken.  However my heart is really set on working with American Airlines as a flight attendant, and I totally plan on applying again when the next opportunity arises, but I need to look at my other options as well. What can I do in the meantime? 

&#x200B;

I'm definitely applying for other airlines and keeping an eye out for when Delta and United start hiring (for more than just a bilingual position). I have no experience as a flight attendant, and find myself wondering if I could get experience with another airline - would that make me more desirable as an applicant? Since Mesa airlines have a partnership with American and United is there a possibility of that being a good step in the door? 

&#x200B;

Or would it maybe be better to go another route by applying for a different Job with American? Getting my name and work ethic out there and known within the company, and so when there's later on a chance to apply for my desired job they know who I am, and I am doing so internally. I see that they have a Customer Assistance Representative position open, and as I have several years of customer service under my belt this wouldn't be a hard jump to make.

&#x200B;

Any advice, or opinions on this matter would be greatly appreciated.","['It’s best to keep your options open. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Before I became a FA, I had no experience.

It hurt but oh well, that’s life. \n\nI was so convinced that I was going to be a FA for DL and no one else. Then I started looking at regionals. I didn’t do as extensive of a research as I did for mainline but one particular carrier kept on popping up. I applied and was hired. I went to training and let me tell you, it was intense. Nothing can prepare you for the type of training this company did. Especially since I didn’t know squat about the aviation industry. Because of our contracts, we can fly for multiple carriers including the big three that I applied for. \n\nBeing with my current airline, I realized that pushing myself to believe that DL was the only company for me was kinda stupid. I had the opportunity to get to know the other airlines more. I compared the pay/routes/policies/domiciles/etc. What was once the ultimate dream (or so I thought) company that I wanted to work for is now actually on the bottom of my list because I realized the policies of the other carriers works out better for me. \n\nBtw, this isn’t meant to put down DL or anything.

14,Trying to figure out a way to be with my future flight attendant gf while in military,6,d74lus,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/d74lus/trying_to_figure_out_a_way_to_be_with_my_future/,14,1569060353.0,"I'm an active duty military personnel getting stationed in Honolulu, Hawaii next month.
My gf is right now going to flight attendant school in Vancouver Washington and she would be graduating on February and will be doing interviews with different airlines during her school and get hired through the program.

She is trying to get into the Hawaiian Airline to be able to live with me in Hawaii while working based in honolulu airport, HNL it seems like HNL does not have Hubs with any other airlines. 

Anyways, the problem is, she would be age of 20 (3 months before 21) when she is graduated with the school. I heard Hawaiian Air hires people aged over 21.

 I have asked her if she could transfer to hawaiian air as flight attendant even if she gets the job from different airline through the school, such as american airline. But she said she would have to go through like 10 weeks of training again to switch to a different airline and that training is as hard as military basic training..

What would be the ways to be with her as many time as possible?..","[""Tell her to not waste her time going to a FA school. It's seriously a scam and does help further anyone to getting employed by an airline. I'm not saying it to be a dick, her chances are better without it."", ""I second the other comments. Leave the flight school. I'm from Vancouver Washington and I agree that that school isn't worth it. Airlines want to train you their way. \nHave her apply at Alaska airlines or skywest. Skywest is regional however she could quickly gain experience and flexibility plus they have great benefits. Skywest doesn't have layovers in Hawaii but she could use her benefits to visit often"", 'Lol not as hard as military basic training. Considering she hasn’t even done an airline training yet either that’s funny for her to say. \n\nAirline ‘school’ is a giant waste of money. \n\nPeople commute from Hawaii for airlines based in the US but it sure isn’t easy all the time especially if she isn’t mainline with priority for the jumpseat. \n\nHawaiian is also a tough airline to get hired into. \n\nGet used to long distance basically.\n\nETA: American is 6 weeks of training, not 10. \n& no you can’t just transfer between airlines. She’d have to go through the entire application & interview process from the start for each one.', 'Have her try air Alaska! She could be based in Seattle or portland and have a very easy commute to honalulu', 'I’m not saying it’s impossible for her to be based in Hawaii but everything in the industry is seniority based, and as a new hire you’ll be bottom of the totem pole. You don’t really get a lot of choices at the bottom, unfortunately and chances are she’ll be on reserve for a minimum of a year.\n\nI’m my personal opinion, she’s better off looking for an airline with great flight benefits so she can commute (not that commuting is great) but I just feel like it’s more realistic. Not saying it’s impossible, just kind of unlikely.', 'Im gonna go with what everyone else in this group said,she’s better off going to a company like Skywest where she’ll get AMAZING benefits and that way she can go see you with easier access.', 'Hi there, congrats on getting stationed in Hawaii! Speaking from experience, I left a job I loved to be a flight attendant for a major airline so I could work and be with my now-husband who is in the military. \n\nJust as others mentioned, her best bet will be commuting from Hawaii. Hawaiian is an awesome airline, however, they are not hiring English only speakers at the moment (they recently closed the application process, only LOD speakers are able to apply). All airlines are super selective, Hawaiian used to be more selective (e.g., must be from Hawaii), however the have made great strives in widening the talent pool. \n\nI would encourage her to apply to all airlines and if she gets a conditional job offer from all, great. If she get’s an offer from one, take it. If she’s rejected from all, she needs to keep applying. All airlines will state the minimum age during the application process, you’ll also be able to google this information. My good friend applied, interviewed and got hired with American when was 20. She went to training in August and didn’t turn 21 until the end of October. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend going to a school. All airlines have specific training. I know from my initial training we had prior FA’s and instructors would get so annoyed with my classmates that would mention “Well at ________, we did this”. They would get shut down real quick. All airlines have different verbiage for safety procedures, it’s too easy to mix them up. Airlines always hire a diverse set of people (moldable folks who have no experience as a flight attendant, prior FA’s, young and old folks). Honestly the people who get hired from FA schools have more to do with their personality, character and professional experience vs it being attributed to the school. If it makes her more confident during the interview process, then that’s great too but it’s not needed. \n\nMy husband signed a new contract for base choice and Hawaii was an option we heavily considered, we didn’t choose Hawaii because of our dogs having to get quarantined and the long commute to Boston. After meeting colleagues who commute from Honolulu to Boston, they said it was pretty easy due to Hawaiian having a direct flight and having the option to fly to LAX, SFO, LAS and connecting from there. Wherever she’s based, she’ll have a lot of different commuting options in/out of HNL. \n\nI’m not sure what branch you’re in, we’re Army and I’ve commuted from South Korea, Fort Drum and now Charlotte (husband is currently doing green to gold). Fort Drum was the absolute worst and such a nightmare to commute from due to weather (winter, terrible crosswinds and upstate NY just being a generally underserved area with a lack of flights). I drove half the time to Boston just to make it to work. \n\nWhether the commute is easy or hard, it’s doable. It’s also nice to be able to support your significant other serving while being able to contribute and support your family. \n\nAnother thing to consider is she could work as a gate agent, customer service representative, or bag handler at HNL for one of the major airlines and still have flight benefits. Something to consider if she’d like to come home every night while still having the perks of the job. \n\nGood luck to you both and please reach out anytime!', 'I also recommend she apply for CSA at Hawaiian airlines or another position located in Honolulu until she turns 21. Just 1 year holding a position at another airline makes you look really good when applying for internal positions. They tend to highly consider internal employees at most airlines is my understanding.', ""This. She's wasting lots of money."", 'Oh based on what she told me, the school would arrange the interviews for them and like 80 percent of the students will be hired right off the school. She has been getting all A grades so far in her classes and she seemed to enjoy the program. And the money was paid with fafsa. \nSo you are saying they could get hired as easily as the people without going through any schools or have no knowledge about the airline industry?', 'If the flights weren’t full. 🤷🏼\u200d♀️', ""She already paid for it and there's no way to get refund for it.\nAnd how is the benefits differ in skywest from other airlines?"", ""Easier. I had zero experience other than customer service jobs and was hired. A Canadian based company is going to be completely different than what an American company is going to require. Esch company has a 6-9ish week program they require which is completely different from airline to airline and there is no way they are teaching them what each airline requires. I've also met only one person who has gone to a school to be a flight attendant. It's great that she's doing well, but I think they are fooling her in saying that there's a 80% success rate. She'd be better off working as a gate agent or on the ramp for the airline of her choice then once she's 21 apply for the FA position. I see she's already in the school and I'm not telling you she should drop out. But don't be surprised/ disappointed when it doesn't further her career. Obviously I'm an internet stranger not here to tell you what to do. Just shedding light on the situation that it's not a great way of utilizing time and money."", 'Airlines want to train you their way.

18,Applying as a Flight Attendant for Delta vs American vs United. Help Please!,0,8xgbye,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/8xgbye/applying_as_a_flight_attendant_for_delta_vs/,13,1531199711.0,"Hey guys! I am looking to apply as a flight attendant for either Delta, American, or United. I'm trying to figure out which airline would be the best for me to work for, and wondered what the differences are between the three that I should be most aware of, especially as a newbie FA. I would greatly appreciate your expertise and advice as professionals in the field. :)

My plan was to apply for these companies in the fall when (I thought...) the three applications would all open at around the same time, but United just opened, so I have slightly less time than I thought to mull this all over. 

Questions I have:

1. Differences between Delta, American, and United I should consider in choosing? (Salaries, Unions, Scheduling, Time off, etc and more I wouldn't think of yet)
2. Benefits of Unionizing vs not (as I know Delta is not unionized)
3. Which airline would it be easiest to get a base out of California with? (I am definitely willing to move, but if I can be based in CA with easier access to friends and family that would be the dream.) 
4. I am a German major, and have fairly high conversational German, though I hesitate to call myself fluent- Is it worth trying to apply as Language of Destination/Bilingual? Can I apply to both bilingual and normal positions, or do I only get one application per airline?
5. (United Specific) The application for United that just opened is showing for Chicago- would it be basically guaranteed I would be placed in Chicago (initially at least)? 
6. Odds of starting out with international flights rather than domestic? (I am an International Studies major and dying to get back out into the world again:) 
7. Anything I should do to bolster my application/resume? 
   1. I have so far: Double degree in International Studies and German, a year and a half experience living in Europe with a lot of travel experience, German and Spanish Intermediate/Advanced language skills, working as a waitress now to get more customer service experience, and I am about to take an adult and pediatric CPR/AED/First Aid class.

Thank you so much to anyone who has taken the time to read this and answer any questions!! 

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who answered my questions! You guys have been so helpful. ","['So much to answer.  I can speak for first hand for Delta and United.  \nThe companies offer similar products. Benefits and what not.  \nIf you are looking to stay in California the airline you would most likely to get that would be United.  \nAlthough Delta doesn\'t have a union at this point the employees are pushing hard to get one.  I am guessing only a matter of time before they have one.  I\'ve talked to many friends that agree with it and it could be debated for many hours but in my belief it will happen.  Sad but true.  \nMy experience with Union vs non is just clear cut. More protections with a union.  If you do end up in trouble there ""should"" be someone fighting for you. \n\nLanguage bases are challenging. I would recommend not using it and here is why.  The only language that has a large presence in different places would be spanish.  With German. You will only fly to Germany.... That\'s it.  Granted there are different places to go within Germany buttttt you most likely will have to make a one year commitment to the German base which means you only fly to Germany.  3-5 trips a month. Going to the same place and not having really any options to go anywhere else would be your hurdle.  Again just summing up what my friends in speaker bases have said. That also being said with a German speaker I think most are based on the East coast.  So factor that into your choices.  \nJust because they are hiring for Chicago doesn\'t mean you will get to Chicago.  With the merge finally happening in October I\'m sure they will be opening all bases and allowing people to move.  So even if it says that it isn\'t a guarantee and I know SFO is ALWAYS open. \nDepends on the carrier you select and where you are based. If you want international flying with Delta you need to be based in JFK. For United it would be Newerk or Dullas. \nNothing to be done about your resume.  Smile.  Friendly.  Problem solve.  \nCPR the way the company wants you to  do it will taught to you in training so having the extra training may confuse you.  I used to be an EMT before this career and we were trained to just do compressions no breathing unless you have a bag valve mask.... Which most airlines carry but can only be released to a medical professionals and being in an emergency time is precious.... So to now learn I have to use a pocket mask with breathing is what my procedures are could throw you off. Not sure of what skill level you have but it never hurts to know and have extra training.  \n\nI can talk to you a bit about the reserve system for United and Delta if you want to PM me. Along with insurance and other things specifically about United if you want.  I hope it helps.  Let me know if you need anything.  ', 'I will touch on the union vs non-union carriers.   I’ve been a FA for Alaska Airlines for just under 20 years and can say I would not like flying for an airline without a union.  I know it can be a controversial topic but for me the bottom line comes down to having a guaranteed contract that can not be changed or ignored.   Having a union doesn’t prevent delays, irregular operations or bad days, but it does make certain there are provisions in place when crazy things happen.   Some feel the monthly dues are not worth it but I feel like it’s kind of like an insurance policy.   In this day & age where everyone has a smartphone with camera, it helps to have someone in your corner should you be accused of rude customer service or even a safety issue.   \n\nMy union has a good relationship with management and our contracts are generally well done.   If you have specific questions please feel free to reach out!   Good luck! ', ""Honestly I would apply to all of them and ask these questions when you get to your face to face interviews.  If nothing else you'll get a feel for the culture and be better able to make a decision."", 'I think the 3 major U.S. airlines offer pretty similar products. I love having a union at my airline, but we also still have to fight an awful lot.\n\nI can’t speak much for United or Delta, but the only AA bases that fly to Germany are Dallas, Charlotte and Philadelphia, so if you pass the language qualification exam, one of those will be your base. You probably won’t be able to hold a German line every month for some years, but it could happen. \n \nAs for Californian bases, we have LA and San Francisco. SF is a domestic base. I hear LA is a great base, but the transfer list is loooooooong.\n\nThere’s still a lot going on at AA with the merger, but I think it’s all going fairly well. Both sides of the merger are coming under one contract soon. To my understanding, there are multiple contracts at United due to their several mergers, and it’s been that way for years. \n\nI’ll also put in my two cents about reserve: It sucks. At United, you’d be straight reserve until you’re senior enough to hold a line. At American, you’ll be straight reserve for a year. After your  first year, you’ll switch to a monthly rotating system for 4 years- one month on reserve, the next on a line. After that, it will be 1 month of reserve to 3 line months until you can hold off reserve. Delta has A-days, so a handful of days a month, every month, that you’re on call. Seems pretty sweet to me. ', 'I got to read this just before going in to work, and it was such a huge relief to have so many questions answered! Thank you so much for taking the time to answer everything, I will definitely PM you with more questions. :) ', 'Also, seeing as I was totally panicking for a moment there (I thought I had about another month-two months before applications started opening to get these questions answered).... very relevant username! :D', ""Thank you so much for your reply! I personally am strongly leaning towards unionized airlines, because of all the reasons you outlined. If you don't mind me asking, approximately how much are the monthly dues? Like $25 a month or more like $50-$100? Or is it a sliding scale...? (I know the answer may vary depending on the union but I am big on budgeting so I like to know ballparks in advance at least.\n\nThank you again, I know it is a touchy subject so I very much appreciate your reply! "", ""I definitely plan on doing exactly that! I mostly made this post because United's applications opened up much sooner than I expected and I got worried about applying for United and potentially getting in before I had the chance to find out more about Delta or American. \n\nThanks for the reply! Just getting replies at all is helpful in getting a feel for the flight attendant culture as a whole ;) So far you all seem wonderful and exactly the sort of people I'd love to be around. "", ""The UA/CO contracts will be fully combined in October, I've heard that it will be the same time frame for AA/US."", ""Daw. Thanks! It came about from my last job! 😂 Just fit. No need to panic. Even if they do give you the CJO they aren't looking until the fall to start so you would still have time. "", 'You are most welcome!   Alaska is part of AFA (Association of Flight Attendants) which United is as well.  Our dues are $50 monthly and are the same for all AFA carriers.   You don’t pay any dues during your probation period & then you can choose to pay directly from your paycheck each month.  Most FAs pay this way!   American has their own union so I’m not positive what their dues are but I would imagine it’s similar.   ', ""I think you have more time than you're anticipating... The selection process can take weeks or months just depending on when you apply and how quickly the airline is moving.  I think all three are pretty similar but with Delta in particular you aren't unionized which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your outlook.  I'd definitely consider the reserve requirements as well... Delta seems to have the best option because it's six scheduled days a month of reserve until you can hold it off BUT you can trade those days and move them around and possibly end up with fewer reserve days depending on if more senior mamas and papas want to trade for them.  A lot of them will because they're senior enough to not get used.\nGood luck!  "", 'Thank you so much, that is super helpful to know. ']"

21,"Very interested in becoming an FA, have lots of questions..",4,5axvjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/5axvjn/very_interested_in_becoming_an_fa_have_lots_of/,11,1478220941.0,"Hi! I am a male, 21, in Chicago (o'hare/midway are both the same distance from me) and my contract for my work-at-home job just expired, and after being strapped to home for so long I'm feeling very interested in being a flight attendant as a career forward.

I'm sure this question gets asked a lot (and I've seen male F/As on my flights before, so I'm sure it's not an actual issue), but is being a male an *obstacle* for being considered? Do I need to standout more as a male to be considered? Or is it about the same? I know there's a stereotype (recently-crumbling) that F/As are females, but I'm just curious on any experience some may have on this.

I love flying, I have 3 years of volunteer (read: no referral) customer service (Xbox Ambassador Program - take chats/calls.. volunteer based..), 1 year of actual work with them (Microsoft Consultant, referral might be doable), but I am unsure how valuable these are as they're chat- and call- jobs and not really face to face.

Due to my previously very at-home jobs I don't have ""dress clothes"", would these be worth investing in if I chase this line? I have plain black clothes but nothing in the line of say, a suit, or such. 

Hair! I have pretty long (manbun) hair right now and I read that they have strict appearance guidelines. I'm assuming this means maintaining my longer hair is out of the question, and I'm more than fine with parting ways with it should I get the position - but can I keep it for the interview and deal with this obstacle if I get the job? Or will this impede on my chances of being considered?

I suffer from social anxiety so I trip over my words a little but overall I enjoy meeting new people and feel confident I can get through a one-on-one interview, but a group interview I'm unsure about. Obviously given the line of work, the group one is probably weighted a lot more. Any tips for calming my nerves, should I get an interview?

Lastly, I have no aversion to ""obscure"" or ""lower"" airlines (read:  not American Airlines or Delta, as those require previous Airline experience to begin with). Knowing this, which ones are the best to apply for and most likely to consider me for a position soon?

Thank you very much for any and all help, and I hope you all have a wonderful day!","['It seems like you have a pretty good head on your shoulders and are being realistic about this, so that\'s a great start! Yes, invest in dress clothes. A full suit might not be necessary, but a nice shirt, tie, dress pants, and dress shoes are all must haves. Definitely cut the hair before having any face to face interviews. Shave your face if it isn\'t already, and make sure tattoos are covered. I wouldn\'t worry about being male. Just look professional, and speak professionally. Airlines in the US don\'t really care if you\'re male or female these days.\n\nAssuming you\'re going to need money before actually getting hired as an FA, I\'d get a temporary job working in some sort of customer service. Retail, food service, hosting, something like that. It will add some much needed face-to-face customer service to your resume. Be prepared for it to take a long time to get into a FA training class. It could take 6 months or even up to a year from when you start applying to actually getting hired. \n\nOnce you get an interview, usually it\'s helpful to talk about how flexible you are. Things go wrong every day in this line of work, you have to roll with the punches. After you actually get hired, there will be a waiting period in which you do a drug test and they do a background check, and then sometime after that they\'ll assign you a training date. Training itself will take 4-8 weeks depending on the airline, and it\'s usually unpaid or very minimally paid (my airline gave us a per diem pay of $1 an hour, so we got $24 a day). Hotel is provided, as well as transportation to whatever city has the training, but beyond that you\'re kind of just stuck in a hotel or training center for a month or 2. It\'s an interesting experience for sure.\n\n\nAs for what airline to work for, you\'re most likely to get interviews with an ultra low cost airline (think Spirit, Allegiant, or Frontier) or a regional. That will get you a foot in the door if you want to someday go to the ""big leagues"". Find out what airlines have a base in Chicago, apply for those first. Unless you want to move to a different city or commute, which is doable but always tough. ', 'I think a lot of people underestimate how difficult it is to even get to the face to face interview. Some won\'t even offer a video. \n\nLose the man bun, like yesterday. Flight attendants working in every airline have a very professional, conservative look. I would recommend no facial hair, no ""cool"" hair styles, and keep your nails short and clean. Just be very well groomed. I don\'t think anyone here will deny that appearances play a fairly large role in how the industry chooses to hire. \n\nWith that being said, invest in a decent-ish suit. Nothing crazy, but make sure that it is at least well tailored. I can\'t stress how well put together you need to look. You should even wear the suit for the video interview, if offered. \n\nI suggest striking up conversations with strangers, talking to new people at bars, etc because airlines looks for very personable, communicative people and especially those with customer service experience. \n\nApply LITERALLY everywhere that is hiring right now. It could be weeks until you hear back, and extra interview practice with an airline you aren\'t entirely interested in doesn\'t hurt anyway. \n\nGood luck!', ""FYI - you don't need prior flight attendant experience with the top 3 american airlines (american, delta, united) i interviewed with all 3 of them and passed - currently employed at just 1 of em. You do need customer service experience, that's a huge plus."", 'Got it! Thank you very much for the kind words! I\'m realistic but hopeful, calling this a dream job at this point in time wouldn\'t be too far off so I\'m researching it a lot and trying to get my bearings moving forward. \n\nIs there any job that\'s particularly appealing to airlines for the F/A position? Aside from the mentioned customer service roles I don\'t really have much aside from highschool completed (not dropout>ged or anything silly, full education start to end), and some freelance from-home work (writing, web design), so I\'m open to anything to make standing out easier.  \n\nI definitely need something to hold me over in the mean time but what would make me look more appealing to these lines of work?

23,Career path,1,ahdsji,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/ahdsji/career_path/,11,1547867064.0,I’m trying to plan out my FA career path. I will be turning 18 in 1 & 1/2 years and I have lots of costumer service experience. I want to get a job right at 18 with either jet blue or Hawaiian airline (only 2 airlines I know of that hire at 18). By 21 I want to be working for a legacy airline. I’m wondering if it’s worth working at 18 and then switching 3 years later to a bigger airline or if I should just wait 3 years and apply then. Also how hard is it to switch airlines? Will I still have to do the standard interview/training process? Btw I have dual Canadian American citizenship and I qualify for Irish citizenship as well and I’m currently learning Spanish. ,"[""I wouldn't wait because there's no guarantee that in 3 years your preferred airline will be hiring, or that they'll hire you.\n\nSwitching to another airline is only as hard as getting hired.\n\nAll airlines have their own interview/training process. You don't get automatically hired or get to skip training because you previously worked somewhere else."", ""Hey, that's great that you're figuring your career out at your current age, many do not know what they want to do in their 20s.\n\nEach and every airline will have their own processes when it comes to hiring and initial training. It really depends on the company tbh so every airline you get hired at, you will go through initial every time. Doesn't matter if you've already done it before. You also have ART which is annual recurring training which is basically refreshing your skills.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to try it out and see what happens. Plus, if it isn't something you hoped it would be, you can still easily change your career. I do have to say that some go off on seniority so you may be stuck with reserve for 5+ years or something and suddenly switching will land you right back down if that company also does seniority based."", ""Another thing to keep in mind is that this is a VERY competitive job and some airlines' hiring rates give you better odds of being accepted at Harvard than getting hired by them.\n\nAlthough not the case for everyone, it's taken me over 20+ face to face interviews, over many years, to finally get my first offer.  Not meant to discourage you but something to keep in mind."", 'Yes it would be worth it. All the experience, lingo, knowledge you gain is not something that comes naturally to most people. Also gives you an opportunity to learn how to live on the road. I say go for it.', 'Hawaiian airlines - you will have to relocate to Hawaii, for little pay, as you cannot feasibly commute from the mainland. You will also have to pay for your accommodations during training, as well as your interview process flights/etc. \n\nJetBlue - does not hire at 18 for flight attendants, but does hire ground agents (gate ramp etc possibly) at 18.  I believe JetBlue hires FA’s at 19 or 20. \n\nIf you don’t feel passionately about an airline that will hire at 18, it’s not worth it. The process is competitive and you will likely not be accepted from your first couple of f2fs if you get that far. Use the next three years to prepare, to grow, and decide if this LIFESTYLE is what you want. It’s not constant travel and fun, it’s hard, it’s exhausting, it can drive you financially into the ground. It isn’t for everyone. ', 'Get a job as a CPR instructer or First Aid instructor.

First pick Skywest

If you guys can answer some of my questions that be great! Kind of want to make the right choice with the next part of my life.

I'm a 23 year old male and just graduated last year with Bachelors but not having any luck finding a job in my field. Thinking about a new career and applying to become a flight attendant. Is that weird for male by the way? Also, I know height plays a role and I'm 5'7 but does being buff/heavy side matter too much? I want to see the world and I think this would be the best way. Otherwise I could go back to school for another degree, but wouldn't really like the mundane lifestyle and going on one destination for 2 weeks every year. I've done my research but would like a bit more current insight. I have 7 years of customer service in retail, will that be enough to help to get in? There's a opening at American Airline for bilingual speaker for Cantonese. Just wondering if there is a proficiency test to take? I can speak Cantonese, but I'm not exactly too fluent. At most I can be conversational and still communicate with people but I could practice it more. Is there any writing or reading test for it? What are the pros and cons in your opinions for being a flight attendant?  How hard is the interview process? What are the best airlines to apply for? I live in Atlanta but currently Delta isn't taking application. Not opposed to moving but not sure which airlines pays more and has a better benefits/seniority throughout the year? Would getting into a relationship be hard being away from home several times throughout the month or maintaining a relationship (won't be getting into one anytime soon, just curious how much it affects the partners.)

Thank you in advance for any answers, sorry as well because it is a lot.","[""I can't speak for all airlines and I don't work for American so I definitely can't speak for them buuuuut, that being said, I thin you're in a really good position! Seven years in retail is an amazing plus as well as having your bachelors.  At least with my airline (and I assume American) there will definitely be a written test of your Cantonese to determine your proficiency.  However, don't let that deter you from applying and applying for other airlines as well! Also, think of international airlines as well as smaller charter airlines in the states if the bigger airlines aren't hiring at the moment.  As far as relationships, I obviously can't speak for everyone but I love abroad and never thought I would be able to maintain a happy, healthy relationship with my job but I've met someone amazing who I'm able to see very regularly even with the craziness of our jobs. This is honestly kind of the norm especially after you've been flying for a few years, it's pretty easy to negotiate relationships if you're willing to put in the effort (like any relationship really!) anyway, I hope that helps! Good luck and feel free to pm me if you have any other questions! It really is a great job! :)"", 'Language test at American is both reading and speaking, no writing involved. My speaking part was definitely conversational level with some basic plane role play, ie you spilt coffee on a passenger wut do.

But yes I was a little hesitant to apply because I know probably the basics of Cantonese and can't read/write the language. Silly question but does being too muscular ruin my odds a bit to get the job because of having to go through aisles to help passengers? Also, which international airlines would you recommend because I was aiming for that but would I have to start off with basic training and work my way up? As far as relationships, I know putting in a lot of effort plays role. I was curious if it plays a huge part being away all the time? What are the shifts like exactly? Do you normally just fly to  a destination, stay at crash pad/hotel for a few nights and then just fly back home? Also read that when new flight attendants start out, it is normally on call. Is that all the time or is there a weekly schedule? Thank you again for answering!"", 'Hmm thats interesting. Will think about this one. Also, is there a language barrier and would I pretty much have to find a place to stay in the middle east?', 'Relationships are fickle. Depends on the person you meet. You might meet someone amazing on a layover. Flight benefits are a huge bonus in this in that really you\'re less than 5-6 hours from anyone in the U.S., just they have to patient and understanding. You can\'t always guarantee when you\'ll be able to come see them. Also a lot of airlines do ""reserve"" in which you\'re basically on call at your base for up to 24 hours at a time. \nAlso on trips, the airline puts the flight attendant up. Crash pads are or when you live somewhere else but commute to work. Their a shared community place for flight attendants to stay, and are saving a ton of money by doing so. \nAs far as being on call is concerned, you\'re guaranteed a set number of days off a month and every month your schedule rotates. You bid for the schedule you want with your seniority level. Delta and American have the best systems for this as far as legacy carriers. American rotates every other month. One month is reserve and the next is ""line,"" meaning you know the trips you\'re going to fly for the entire month instead of being in call. Delta has a maximum of 5 or 6 days a month you\'re on call but the rest of your month you hold trips that your seniority bid allowed you to hold. United is just straight reserve until you\'ve been there long enough to hold trips and stop serving it. \nAny airline you choose though you start at the bottom and always receive basic training. Each individual airline has a different set level of approved curriculum from the FAA so even if you have 25+ years of flight attendant experience from another airline, you start all over when you switch. \nIf you want to fly international, go for an international charter airline or, in this order, go with Delta, American, United. ', ""Everyone who works for Emirates or Etihad must speak English. You don't have to speak Arabian. Being bilingual is a bonus. They provide and pay for accommodation. The salary you get is purely spending money. Emirates are hiring right now. Not sure where they recruit in America, but they do all over Australia. \n\nEdit: http://www.emiratesgroupcareers.com/english/Careers_Overview/cabin_crew/CabinCrewAssessmentDays.aspx \n\nThey have interviews in New York. It'd be worth it, even just for experience. You fly with them, you literally can get a job anywhere. \n\nEdit 2: If you have any questions about being a flight attendant/interview process feel free to ask. I'd been to a few before I landed a job and have a good idea for what they look for. Plus I have a fair few friends who work in the Middle East. Can tell you what they've told me :) "", 'Wow thank you, for U.S. though, it says invitation only. How do you get one of the invite? Also, what are the interviews like and what kind of questions do they ask? Are they looking for someone outgoing? I feel as though even though I have 7 years of customer service experience and a Bachelors under my belt, I might get rejected still. One of those worried thoughts, how do I make myself stand out of the 1000 of people applying for the same position? When you say the salary is purely spending money, how much are you able to make monthly if you can answer that question (I can understand if you cannot, so its ok, just curious). Thank you again for helping me out with the information :)', ""It says invitation only because you need to apply. Sometimes they have open days where you just turn up, but I know in Australia you need to apply online then they will email you back inviting you to a seminar. \n\nSo let's just say you've been successful and invited you via email, they will give you a list of things that you need to bring to the interview i.e. Passport, licence, resume, birth certificate, etc. \n\nWhen you show up, there will probably be around another 100 applicants hoping to land a job with one of the most outstanding airlines in the world. There will be a lot of people with previous cabin crew experience but don't let that put you off. You need to be yourself as lame as that sounds. \n\nYour every move and every word will be watched and heard. They are looking for the best of the best. They aren't looking for perfection though... They look for genuine, down-to-earth people who will best represent their airline. Someone who has excellent people skills, smart and being bilingual is a bonus! You seem to have that in the bag though so don't worry about that! \n\nAfter the meet and greet, you will assigned a table with other applicants and asked to do group activities. This will demonstrate how you work in a team. PS. Do your research on the company, group building activities may include the history and vision of Emirates. They aren't looking for a leader; they are looking for someone who is helpful and not dominant. However don't sit back and relax. If someone wants to take over, let them because they won't get the job. However if no one puts their hand up, then take the lead humbly. \n\nAfter the activities, they will dismiss you for lunch and you'll get a letter or a call inviting you for a panel interview. They will ask scenario questions with customers like when did you have to deal with an irate customer, stuff like that. With 7 years experience, you're bound to have some stories up your sleeve! Sometimes they ask personality questions i.e. Strengths and weaknesses, but they won't do too many since they do a psych test as part of your medical if you get through the next round. Just google cabin crew interview questions so you can practice. But don't fake anything and don't overanalyse! They will know. They are pros. \n\nAfter the panel interview, you go home and wait until you get an email either rejecting or inviting you to do a medical and a psych test. It's the last stage but it pretty much means you've got the job. They may take up to a month to reply. They have lots of applicants to sift through! \n\nYes they are looking for someone outgoing but also professional :) There's always that chance of rejection, I've been knocked back three times, however it sounds like you've got a lot more going for you than against you. They look for people like you! \n\nYou stand out by being yourself. When you go to a seminar, you'll know who's being a fake bitch and you will cringe. They aren't the ones who are gonna get the job. Just be friendly, genuine and polite. \n\nThe salary, from what I could find, the base starts at $1065 USD a month. It increases each year and after your training. In saying that, the company provides accommodation, you get paid for every hour you fly, you get a month annual leave and a free return ticket home, life and accident insurance, profit share scheme (if the company earns a profit you get a bonus which is likely with emirates), if you last the three years (that's the contract but you can still break it) you get a bonus, staff travel, and a Emirates card to give you discount at hotels, retail stores and leisure outlets. So that $1065 basically for food and leisure. \n\nSorry this reply was really long!! But wanted to give you max info. Flying is seriously the best job in the world on top of that! I don't get paid much, but I seriously love my job so much it doesn't really matter. It's one of those jobs which so many people want to do but so few do it :) \n\nSorry if there are grammar mistakes, didn't correct anything. \n\nEdit: link about being an emirates FA http://www.smh.com.au/travel/blogs/the-backpacker/the-truth-about-being-a-flight-attendant-20130711-2psji.html"", ""Sorry for the late reply, been just busy and not able to get on Reddit much. Wow thank you for all the information and link. Do you know if getting an invitation, they will pay to fly you out for a chance or is it only for interviews? I met someone that said that they paid for her hotel and flight for a in person interview? Being a flight attendant really does fit all the description that I'm looking for. I'm just worried about the interview because it is my weakness and group interviews is my biggest. I went to a Apple group interview a few weeks ago and got rejected the next day, kind of worried about how this interview process will work out. Even with my 7 years plus Senior CSR status, doesn't feel like it will be enough for them. Sorry just been bummed by the constant jobs rejection :(. The Emirates is interesting but I wished it wasn't a 3 year contract though. Looking to build up a seniority status and stay longer with one company, also is one able to become a manager starting as a flight attendant? Thank you again for alllll the max information :D""]"

I've got training in the German language under my belt and right now working as an FA at Lufthansa seems like it's where I want to go. So here what I have to ask...

1. What is the median age for entry level FAs? When did you get your first job and go through training? I feel impatient but I don't want to rush things in case these companies are looking for people with a certain amount of life experience.

2. Do most people get a job in their home country, with a smaller airline, before applying to giants like Lufthansa or UAE? I groan at the thought of flying back and forth in between two lousy American cities for a few years before making this an international career, but of course I'm willing to do it if that's the most common path. 

Thanks for your time! ","[""I'm a regional FA and flying between American cities isn't bad. There's only a few places I hate going. International seems like way too much work for me."", ""IIRC Lufthansa only hires those with EU citizenship. \n\nIf you're a German speaker, the major airlines in the US may have German speaker positions open up   "", 'A few questions/thoughts\n\n* Are you fluent in German or just conversational? Training could mean anything from a few semesters in college to been speaking it since elementary school. Lufthansa will want fluency.\n\n* Do you have an EU/EEA passport?

They have a pretty extensive short-haul map across Europe, you\'re never guaranteed long-haul unless you have enough seniority to dictate your own schedule.  \n\n* On that same point, everything about being a flight attendant revolves around seniority. So while you may have to fly between ""lousy"" cities for a bit, you work your way up to hold a line and try to bid your own ideal schedule. Doing that for a few years, then jumping to a different airline puts you back to the bottom of the list.

32,We’ve got a situation...,5,83e7g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/83e7g5/weve_got_a_situation/,9,1520702823.0,"PLEASE HELP!
I am a aspiring FA, I would love to work for American Airlines or Delta. I want to travel and see the world even if I have to do it alone... 

My main thing is, has any flight attendant been out in a situation they didn’t know how to handle? 

I’m extremely scared I might do the wrong thing, i.e...

One time I was on a Greyhound bus, sitting in the window seat, 2nd row, a little old lady sat next to me. The bus gets a little noisy, the wind hitting windows etc...  Next thing you know this guy is going up and down the aisle, he starts talking about forgetting his meds and he starts talking (I think his references were) war, battle and his buddies. I thought anxiety? PTSD? I didn’t know what to do, he was just standing by my aisle next to the little old lady. I want to ask him if he was okay, but he was calm, just whimpering and mumbling. I stay cool, he touches the ladies hair, I don’t know if accidentally or on purpose and she whimpers, he says sorry. I really wanted to escort him back to his seat but all I could think about was Greyhound doesn’t do security checks, he could have a weapon, what if my intervention triggers something? I wanted to ask the driver or the man in front of me for help, but I was afraid. Maybe I was going to trigger danger to people around me, especially the little old lady next to me. The PTSD  guy gets closer to this driver and door, not sure what he’s aiming for, the guy and woman in front freak out and grabs him. PTSD guy then freaks out, and says I don’t want to hurt you, man says I don’t want to hurt you either but you’re putting my life in danger, PTSD guy says I just want get off the bus. The lady that grabbed him calls the cops, and he’s safely escorted.

I’m upset because I did nothing, I bought the lady a water bottle at the pit stop to try and comfort her but I practically did nothing. 

My dream is to become a flight attendant, but what if something like that happens on a plane and I don’t know what to do? How to handle?

Currently, I'm waiting on training dates from both airlines but I have a feeling United will be giving me dates sooner than American. I am really torn with which airline to go to. I'm from Dallas  and like the idea of being close to home with American, but I understand both airlines have certain bases that are deemed ""senior"", and different ways they do reserve/hold lines... but that's all I know. Any advice on the pros and cons of each airline would be greatly appreciated!","['Go with American. They act like a family and are quite hard to get in, United is too but American is harder and I think better. My experience with American flight attendants has been more fun, I think United is too strict and takes the fun out of the job. United has great crew discounts and a lot of bases and destinations if you want to non rev but they oversell flights. Remember that once you’re with a airline it’s usually for your whole career, is a shorter reserve life worth quality of life? You may regret it as a senior mamma', 'Dallas is really junior now. You may not get it right out of training but you’ll get it within 6 months of the job or less. American has been good to me....just don’t wear the uniform lol.', 'I work for a different carrier, but have friends that work for both AA and UA and I\'m familiar with their contracts and bases. You should research both of those and see what would work better for you and the lifestyle you want. Reserve is a big thing... With AA, you start with a year on straight reserve, and then it goes to one month on reserve, one month as a line holder for 3 years. After that, I believe it\'s 1 month on and then 3 months off of reserve. With United, you could be on straight reserve for years... Some bases have been for 10-15 or more. You could get a line for a few months and then go back on. Both are obviously huge carriers that fly wide body aircraft and you\'ll have international options. The pay is similar for each. Google both of their contracts since those are public information. You can also join ""Flight Attendant Career Connection"" on FB and search posts about both carriers and see what people who work there have to say. Personally, if it was me, I would pick AA because they have a base where I live and I have the option to at least be on rotating reserve after a year. UA also has 24 hour reserve and you have to bid for the 12 hour shifts which is awarded based on seniority. AA has only 12 hour reserve shifts.

38,Tips and Tricks to Get Through,30,99emol,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/99emol/tips_and_tricks_to_get_through/,8,1534982929.0,"Everyone keeps wanting to know the same questions, so here is my summary as best as I can get. I have posted this before in and out of other comments, and hopefully this will narrow it down and help you. I applied to 4 regionals, got 3 interviews, (one I later declined), and got both offers from the ones I interviewed with. The one regional I didn't get was because I have more than 5 jobs in 5 years, and a non-visible tattoo. So, here is my thoughts to help you:

1. If you are serious about being an FA, it might take you a year or more to get through several applications before being hired. I strongly recommend you take any medical classes like 'First Aid' or 'Basic CPR' to add to your application. (both are generally one day classes and not expensive) Airlines seem to all screen for medical and fine dining backgrounds. I was an Emergency Medical Technician, and for whatever reason, it was on every application I did and helped me get through. Also, any high end waiter jobs are also VERY helpful as is bartending. Avoid having 'too many jobs' hurt me.  **** Before even applying, know the height requirements and tattoo policy. If you are too short or too tall or have a large visible tattoo you will immediately be cut. Don't even apply and go through the process as it's a waste of your time. **** Have a MATCHING passport and state ID. We had one applicant have a married name on her papers, but her maiden name on her passport and she was going to be cut. She could prove she applied for an updated passport and made it through barely. Make sure your stuff matches.

2. Have to do a video interview? Here is what you should know. Most video interviews are of you, answering a question in under a minute from your laptop or cell phone. Some you can do over and over until you get it right. I would actually set up a test ahead of time. Use your laptop camera and video yourself against a solid wall background. Wear a blazer and shirt, and make sure the audio is clean and clear. When doing your videos, avoid 'uh's and 'um's. Speak very slowly and also if you can, write down common phrases ahead of time and sprinkle them into your video interview. Things like 'I am a great candidate for your airline because I am on time, work efficiently, and am perfect at solving customer issues to retain customer loyalty."" Sprinkle educated phrases like this ahead to seem smart and confident. Anytime you can throw in '..helping you make an informed, intelligent decision about hiring me...' goes a long way. 

3. Going to your face to face? YAY! Here is what you should know. 

(A) If you are male, shave. No beards, hipster stuff, earrings, rings, tattoos, or anything that makes you who you are. Your goal is to look like a conservative bank teller. If you are a lady, dress conservative also, no wisps of hair in your face. use lots of spray and hair gel or product and tie your hair back in a bun. Hair should be off of the neck. I think if you have braids/dreads as long as it's tied back you should be ok. No black lipstick. No dangly earrings or anything like that. Google bank teller and that's what you want to look like. Dark blazers, dark pants. Conservative. Look the part. No hipster rings on your hands, or funky watches. One ring. One watch. Maybe a bracelet but I would avoid it. 

(B). Pick your favorite paragraph from your favorite book. Stand in front of a mirror. Try and smile and read it aloud. Read it very very slowly. You will be nervous when you do it, and so your brain will want to read fast, so read slow so it sounds normal when you do it. During the interview, you will be handed a safety paragraph you will be expected to read loudly. Smile, read it aloud slowly. You may be in front of a hundred people, so I hope you are confident in being in front of lots of people. I watched an applicant get up in front of a hundred people, freeze up and cry. Don't be that applicant.

(C) Customer turnaround. Know a well thought out story about a time when you turned around an angry customer into a happy one. Be able to smile as you are saying it, and get it to about a minute long. No 'um's or 'uh's. Speak slow, and with purpose. Pretend you are a stand up comedian in that you should be active, command attention, even talk with your hands if need be. If you stand up like a frozen nervous lump, you will get cut. I actually wrote mine out so I could practice ahead of time and could recite it reasonably well. 

(D) Interview. Mention in the interview how much fun it was to learn CPR and First Aid, and how fascinated you are in learning safety procedures aboard Aircraft. Try and slip it in there when they ask you why you feel you are a great candidate. It might help you get through it. Avoid cliche stuff like 'I'm great with people'. Instead say things like 'I am a master at creating dynamic solutions on the fly to help solve issues angry customers face'. They will look for steps to turn an angry customer, like 'Listen, empthathize, apologize, and propose a solution. (L.E.A.P.)

(E) RESEARCH your airline. I guarantee they will ask you 'What do you know about us?'. Go to the airline's website and know that they operate a fleet of 150 jets and fly to over 180 US Destinations plus Canada and the Caribbean. Know they have about 5,000 employees. Know they have 5 US Bases.

(F) If they ask you if you will relocate, ALWAYS say yes. 99.9% of the time you know the base you are hired for so you know where you have to move to. You can always decline later if you are about to start training and feel you don't want to relocate. 

4. Pay. Before you even apply, make sure you have two full months of money set aside as most training is not paid. Regional training is 4 weeks and up to two weeks for your 3-day initial operating experience. This means it can be two full months before getting a paycheck. Also, $18/flight hour is NOT $18/hr but rather about $9/hr. You don't do this for the money. Regional Airlines like Compass/Endeavor Air/SkyWest/PSA/CommutAir are domestic and fly from Canada to the Bahamas. Mainline such as Delta/American/United fly internationally and can pay as much as $28/flight hour, which is substantially more. Know the money and the facts before.

Anyways, this is my summary so far. I may edit it in the future, but I hope this helps all of you get through and join me in the air. Best of luck!","['TL;DR but my best tip for any interview situation is that the story you tell, or the answer you give to a question like ""Tell me about a time that you provided great customer service"" can be 100% false and no one will know. If you\'re quick on your feet you can ace any interview. ', 'This is all excellent information, but upon hire your medical skills from basic survival/first aid classes will be kind of moot as you learn how to use emergency procedures per the airline protocol, they don’t care if you have certification because in the event of emergency you’ll be practicing Good Samaritan care - not certified (insert training here) and unless operating an AED you’ll be under direction from medlink or a similar company, if a doctor on board isn’t doing it for you. \n\nIt looks good, comes slightly in handy, doesn’t make all the difference however. \n\nThe rest is spot on! ', 'Is southwest mainline or is it another name? Are we the odd ones?', ""Right. You won't get to USE any of your information, but every application I have filled out (4) has asked if you have HAD medical training. For whatever reason, they seem to feel they make the best candidates."", 'Southwest is mainline. ', 'Lol Southwest is Mainline. ', 'Absolutely. Any medical experience means you’re equipped for crisis, and probably good at stress management. ', 'Phewww scared']"

42,The Flight Attendant Pay -in 9 to 5 (US airlines),14,2o6sca,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/2o6sca/the_flight_attendant_pay_in_9_to_5_us_airlines/,7,1417667771.0,"All aviation pay is tricky. Lets compare it to the 9 to 5 worker,as best we can.

Per diem will not be included as the federal government does not recognize it as income. Just to add, an average per diem may be  $1.75/250hrs a month to equal around 437.50 a month. Profit sharing can not be included in this scenrio as many airlines do not have a program for it or its to specific of a  program for their work groups.
(confused yet? good!)


In a month(30 day month) an average 9 to 5 worker has 8 days off and works 8hrs a day, that is 176 hrs a month. Most airlines give a set guarantee of days off and hours a month to a flight attendant. In this scenrio we will be using the 11 days off and 80hrs of pay a month.

I have been extensively researching the flight attendant hiring process, and this thought just came to me randomly and I am hoping to get your opinions on it. I personally don't recall whether I've seen too many POC flight attendants in my flying experience, unless I am actually flying to, say, an Asian destination. 

From what I recall, I usually see older white females (due to seniority, I am assuming) on the routes I have flown. I am based on the West Coast, and I have noticed maybe one of two POC FAs on Alaska and Southwest, but not the rest of the airlines. 

I am hoping to shoot for regional carriers and possibly majors when I start applying. As a minority person, I guess I've sort of been conditioned to notice these things more. And I am hoping to get your opinion:

Generally, do airlines have a policy to actively recruit minorities and promote diversity? This probably differs highly with an airline's corporate values (say, Virgin v. American). And with that, would regional airlines be more likely or less likely to hire minorities? 

FWIW, I am not saying this will hinder me from applying at all. I believe I have fair qualifications, but thought this would make for an interesting discussion.

I've been doing some extra research and while Qatar definitely is an option, it is no longer number one on my list. The views of their country and their own strict rules and bad publicity/bad imagine in the media doesn't really scream *'amazing company.'* 

So, I should probably begin by introducing some important facts about myself; I'm an eighteen-soon-to-be-nineteen-year-old male from Serbia who only carries the citizenship of Serbia and no other country. I am also bisexual (and hence only a fraction of the problems with Qatar), speak two languages fluently (Serbian and English), and am learning a third (Portuguese), in which I am not even conversational yet. I do my schoolwork online, via an online American high school and am in my last year-- due to my somewhat erratic schedule this year, I am still finishing up but will be holding a high school diploma by the end of this year.

Obviously, my choices are somewhat limited: a) go with AirSerbia which is *far* from ideal (late payments, low salaries, etc.) or work for a company like b) Qatar Airways which doesn't require that you hold a passport of their base country. At least, that's the way I see it, which is why I've come here! There could always be a few more options which I'm missing, so please tell me about them!

I️ have a f2f in Dallas on Friday. I️ have a few questions to anyone experienced with the FA interviews with AA. 

I️ was provided with flight arrangements. But no mention about a shuttle? Do I️ take a cab to the interview site on my own? Does the Dallas airport provide cab services like they do in NY? Or should I️ uber there? Google maps says public transport will take 1.5 hours, and I️ won’t make it in time for the interview. Is that the shuttle?

I️ applied to be a bilingual FA, and it says so on my interview confirmation, will they be testing my language proficiency on site? Are the other candidates also bilingual? 

I️ want to bring some toiletries with me to the interview site. Tooth brush, contacts solution, tampons, and some make up in case I️ need to touch up after my flight. I️ know they offer an area to store luggage but will they let me keep my purse with me? 

Will I️ be allowed to bring a small notebook with me into the interview? I️ habitually like to take notes if there will be a presentation. 

Will they drug test me on site? I️ do have an anxiety medication prescribed to me by a MD, should I️ bring proof of that? 

My confirmation says the interview is from 1-5p, how long was your interview? I️f somehow I️ can finish before 3p, there is a rock climbing gym in the area that I️ want to check out (haha) and I’m wondering if I️ should pack my climbing gear with me to Texas 😭 just in case!

Of course if anyone has any advice or tips to share even if unrelated to the above questions, it would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks guys ♥️♥️ much love

Is there anything any advice you could give me in order to help me sway them to finally make the move? How's your experience with the airline you currently work for?

My sibling currently does not hold a ""line"" at the moment, so that's why I'm trying to convince them to make the move now before they get used to living a life with a line. Thanks for the helpful tips and advice that you send me! ","['[deleted]', ""I work for a regional airline like SkyWest as well. We are sort of a competitor, sort of. Anyway, at my job, it takes about a year to be a line holder at my base. Other bases are different. Once you have a line, and depending on the availability, you can _potentially_ drop a good amount of your flying, keep your benefits, and make more elsewhere, like uber or waiting tables in a big airport. Working for a 'mainline' airline is great because you get almost triple the pay because the flights are longer. Instead of $18/flight hour, for 3 flight hours in a 12 hour day, you will now get $24/flight hour, for 8 hours in a 12 hour day. So it is way more money. Plus, you get to travel abroad which is amazing. \n\nMany senior people at regionals drop all their shifts, work the minimums to keep benefits, and work elsewhere. Non-senior work extra, upwards of 120 flight hours a month, never see their beds, and save every penny. Greenhorn workers are on reserve, and get a guarantee usually of 75 flight hours whether they fly or not. \n\nRemember, as far as health, after 5 years, you have a decrease in life expectancy, as well as an increase in the likelyhood of cancer. At a regional, many experience hearing loss over time, as well as other health issues from the constant up and down and up and down in a day, as opposed to mainline. \n\nAll in all, I think it really depends why you got into it.

1. Are you guys on straight reserve for 15+ years??? Or do you do what American does and switch between reserve and lines?

2. How much are you away from home?

3. How diverse are your layovers?

4. Is working international flights competitive/for more senior FA's? How common are international layovers?

8.  Anything else to note??

Thank you!!","[""1. Depends on the base and what pre-merger subsidiary you are hired under. Old United and Old Continental are still not flying together until October 2018. More than likely as a new hire, you'll end up at a more junior base, where you could be on reserve from 1-3 years. We do have some bases that are 15 years reserve. But everything is pretty fluid, and you can transfer around to the junior bases pretty easily once your probation is up.\n\n2. A lot\n\n3. Also depends on your base a lot, but there is pretty good diversity.\n\n4. Also depends on the subsidiary/base you are at, and the international location. In Newark on the Continental side, a lot of reserves have been flying internationally this summer.\n\n5. Our current union website (calafa.org) has all the information you need about salary and the current working contracts/pay scales as well.\n\n6.

1) I've got a F2F with PSA on Wednesday - can anyone lend any insight as to what they're like? I know it's a regional airline so shorter routes (and less pay) operating as American Express, but that's about it.

2) I applied for AA back in December, did the assessment a few days later, and then did the VI a couple of weeks ago. I'm waiting to hear back on F2F for them as well; any advice? Or am I just in the ""hurry up and wait"" stage?

3) I applied for Delta back in August, did the video interview about a week later, then the assessment about 2.5 months later...and haven't heard anything since. Although on Delta's website, it says my application is still ""under review"" (though its archived now). 

4) I know that, starting off, the pay is rough; how does everyone adapt at first? Also, in the event I need relocate (which I almost certainly will have to, as my current hometown isn't a hub), I've been told there are resources that help FA's help find affordable housing. Where do you folks recommend I start my search?

Thanks in advance, and I look forward to hearing responses.","['PSA is a regional. You get paid $18/flight hour which works out to about $9 per hour plus per diem.

I used to be a flight attendant for a regional airline for a few months back in 2012. I was fresh out of college and had dreams of being a flight attendant. The airline had a newer crew base where I lived, so I figured it was a perfect fit. The base was only open for a few months and then the base was terminated. I was informed that all of us would have to relocate to the IAD base. I had some personal family health issues and I was not in a spot in my life where I felt comfortable enough to relocate. The company literally only gave us a week to relocate before the base shut down. I ultimately decided to quit. I did not give the appropriate two weeks before leaving and therefore am not eligible for rehire.

I received my FAA flight attendant certificate in September 2012. I have applied for both mainline Delta and United’s flight attendant openings recently.  I do not list the regional on my resume because I feel that would only hinder my chances when they see I was a flight attendant for only a few months. 

I interviewed with mainline American about a year after I left the regional and actually got to the f2f and actually got pulled aside with a few other people to speak with additional airline representatives after they escorted a large group out. The reps asked more detailed questions about my experience at the regional and also my reasoning for leaving. I was very honest with them. After, I was very confident and thought that I had it, but ultimately got a tbnt email about a week later. 

I feel that being open about my experience and my ineligibility to be rehired definitely hurt my chances with American.

Regardless of listing the regional on my application, I am still searchable on the FAA website.  My question is, If anything did happen with Delta or United and I passed training, would already being in the FAA Database and not mentioning my previous experience be enough for them to rescind a job offer?

Any input is appreciated! Thanks!","[""They're going to run a background check and find out for sure, it's very extensive.\n\nAlso I believe they ask on the application for ALL jobs you had within the last 10 years.\n\nLastly, they will ask you to explain any gaps in work history.\n\nBasically my answer is, you should be honest because it's gonna come out one way or a another."", ""If I was you I'd be honest that you had to leave because a family health concern but maybe not mention you quit because you were unwilling/ unable to relocate.

Should I still do my face to face or will it just be a waste of time. ","[""Yes, my buddy worked for Airtran and now SWA. They are accomadting with his Army Reserve stuff. He's off for a whole month to do some Army stuff.""]"
109,Will I have issues applying for a flight attendant job in the EU without a fluent second language?,1,ajt79i,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/ajt79i/will_i_have_issues_applying_for_a_flight/,1,1548476671.0,"The general consensus seems to be that you're better off having a second language that you can properly speak. For reference, I'm an American native with dual German citizenship as well and I'm living in Germany, though my German isn't up to snuff. I considered working for a US airline, but I have no interest in moving back to the US, so unless they have a hub abroad that's a no from me.

If I had to give my German a rating, it would only be around A2 or B1 level. I get the gist of things but my speaking is poor. Would I be at a heavy disadvantage due to this when applying for places? My intent is to improve either way, but I figured it's best for me to know what I'm getting myself into.","['EasyJet is hiring in Berlin. Permanent contracts and the conditions are pretty good (even better than Lufthansa). And they have a language alleviation program, where German is not required the first year of employment (but you have that year to learn it to a good conversational level). ']"
