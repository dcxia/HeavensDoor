0,ONE-WAY TICKET HOME - Emergency!!!,15,6xrqxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/6xrqxf/oneway_ticket_home_emergency/,30,1504449952.0,"Hello, I need to understand if I won't have any problems boarding an intercontinental flight (and other connecting flights) from Europe to the USA.
I'm escaping the country because of my abusive husband (more details in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/6xkymz/drastic_decision_urgent_advice/ )

Could someone tell me if this will be enough to be accepted on board? I'm utterly terrified of being refused entrance for some reason. And I don't really want to say I'm escaping to the airline staff. I'll have:

- US passport
- EU ID card (the one I use here as a resident).
- Birth certificate just in case
- Boarding passes, of course.
- Carry-on bag within whatever weight limit the airline asks for.

I am an American going back home, but would they ask me about why I'm flying one-way? Or about my EU identification card, would they ask if I'm married and to show proof or something? 

I still have to buy my plane ticket as I am having my passport renewed.

1,"Flight cancelled with AA, found another on Delta and AA won't help. Need to vent.",0,ca9axc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/ca9axc/flight_cancelled_with_aa_found_another_on_delta/,28,1562548936.0,"My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

2,Looking for a new airline,0,afzpjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/afzpjx/looking_for_a_new_airline/,26,1547524965.0,"After flying most of my life with them, Southwest finally pissed me off with their constant delays and poor service (which it really is once you peel back the layers; they just sugarcoat how they're screwing you). I realize that Southwest was considered one of the ""good ones,"" but I'm now shopping for a new airline. I fly between Dallas and DC 25+ times a year for work.

Problem is, I already have reasons to hate American and United, pretty much the only other options I have (I have no reasons to hate Delta but they are never a low enough airfare for me to expense it).

I have Southwest A-List but it looks like status matching isn't an option for me, because American has that weird status challenge program that I don't think I'd be able to meet the requirements for (nor do I want to pay for the privilege of trying it), and I already have Premier Silver at United through my Marriott Platinum Elite status.

3,Will I have enough time to transfer from my domestic to my international flight?

I've never flown with a layover so I'm not familiar with the process, so please clarify this process with me!

Another thing I'm confused about and customer service from AA and CheapOAir could not help me with: The JAL/CheapOAir itinerary mentions the flight is operated by American Airlines. I could not confirm if my flights are connected or know if there is any chance it could be. Is there any chance my checked baggage would be flown directly from SFO to HND? Of course, I'll ask the check-in desk the day of, but the trip is in about 20 days and this worries me.

Also, my AA itinerary says I'm flying Economy. Is this the same as Basic Economy? Will I even have checked baggage?

some misc. thoughts: I wish Kayak recorded my hacker fare purchases. And CheapOAir, I was not warned that selecting a seat would charge me, and I could not undo it!","['> I could not confirm if my flights are connected or know if there is any chance it could be\n\nYour flights aren\'t connected, but you can ask that your bags be checked all the way through. I believe official policy is not to do it, but there\'s a chance they\'re agree to do it.\n\n> Also, my AA itinerary says I\'m flying Economy.\n\nEconomy is not Basic Economy. If you\'re flying ""Main Cabin"", you get a carry-on bag. If you can select seats in advance for free, you are in Main Cabin. Regardless, if your bags aren\'t checked through, you\'ll have to pay $25 for the checked bag. Economy is not entitled to checked bags on a domestic flight.\n\n> And CheapOAir, I was not warned that selecting a seat would charge me, and I could not undo it!\n\nI find it hard to believe you weren\'t warned of this. And I\'m quite certain most seats can be selected for free in regular Economy.', ""You'll be cutting it close. Since you have 2 separate tickets you'll need to collect your bags and go to International departure. I don't know first hand how far that is at LAX but you can google it.\n\nYou need to be checked in at least 1 hour ahead of departure for your international flight.  So, better hope your domestic flight is on time or early and your bags come out fairly quickly.\n\nJAL and AA are codeshare partners so while you booked a JAL ticket and have to deal with JAL for customer service, changing flight, etc , the actual plane you will fly on is an AA plane & crew. \n\nYes, you will be in basic economy class. First bag should be free, $100 for second bag, $200 each bag there after "", 'You could be in Basic Economy for the first short flight, but not for the international one. I don\'t believe they can be on the same reservations, though (they can\'t for my airline) so you\'re probably in standard Economy class.\n\nSecondly, I work for a different legacy airline. Whether it\'s one ticket or two, if you present all confirmation numbers at your first check-in counter, policy (for us at least) is that we can check your bags all the way through if you are on two flights operated by us, or a combination of flights operated by us AND our alliance. It looks like JAL is part of OneWorld which is AA\'s alliance, so they could potentially check it all the way through for you. I couldn\'t confirm that without seeing the ticket, but we do that often. In some cases you have to ""short-check"" which is a weird way to describe picking your bag off of one belt and dropping it 10 feet away on another belt. I\'ve done that going to Japan when connecting in San Francisco - literally just pick it out of a pile and bring it to another belt and voila, it\'s checked to the international flight.\n\nIf it\'s operated by AA and has an AA flight number you\'ll be checking in with AA. \n\nSeats can be free to select in regular Economy - unless there\'s none left to choose. It\'s possible there are no complimentary seats to select and the only things left are the next highest cabin (Plus or whatever they call it depending on the airline). Then you would be assigned at check-in or gate. ', 'Was lucky that they had another flight less than 3 hours later.

Two weeks ago (March 8), I booked round trip flights for two to Sydney, Aus on American Airlines. 

Less than a week ago (March 20), we found out I am pregnant with an anticipated due date of November 28. This would put me at the far end of 7 months leaving and just inside of 8 months returning. My doctor has already stated this would be too late for travel of this length, and moving our flights up would be an additional 200% of the cost we already paid. 

Is there a way I can cancel these flights with minimal financial damage/loss? I don‚Äôt want to proceed to far on AAs cancellation without knowing if there‚Äôs a more affordable way to do so first. 

EDIT: I was able to cancel online with a cancellation fee of $200 per ticket ($400 total). I did call and speak with CS, explaining why I was cancelling (not that I was special ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). She directed me to contact their email help and provide them the dated letter from my doctor indicating I was medically disallowed to complete the trip at his direction. This has them reviewing the option to refund the remaining $400 at their discretion. Thanks for all advice!!

EDIT 2: American refunded all but $200 of our original booking - which included the cost of our upgraded seats, one entire ticket 100% and all but $200 of the second ticket.

So, I'm taking a trip to LA for the first time this summer, staying about five days.   
I don't travel/fly often and, like everyone else, would like a great deal.

  
I did a search and found a rather low priced flight ($246), nonstop, with American Airlines, one carry-on included, no seat assignment. This was from the Priceline website, which I have never used. At least, not for flights. Meanwhile, on Southwest, comparable flight itineray with one close to two-hour stop, for $326.66.   


The Southwest ticket is a bit higher but not terribly annnd I don't believe I get a baggage fee.   
Does anyone have any experience purchasing flights off of Priceline?  
Between Southwest and American, which would you choose? ?

I don't know why I'm having such a difficult time pulling the trigger on this. I've only ever flown Southwest before, so  not sure if I the better price on Priceline is a false lure or what.

That you get to check two check bags without paying extra, which you probably don't need to do anyway?

Really, the US domestic airlines, save for perhaps Spirit, Allegiant, and Frontier (which are very obviously, even to novices, marketed as ultra-low-cost carriers), don't vary much in quality.

Pack socks inside of shoes if you are packing shoes. If you roll your clothes, you can roll them up and use your socks to keep the rolls together so they don't come undone. Wear your bulkiest clothes onto the plane, like pants, sweaters/jackets, sneakers, etc. If you can avoid packing toiletries, do it. Most hotels carry everything you need in terms of soap/shampoo/razors/shaving cream. Obviously bring your own toothbrush and tooth paste. A lot of hotels also have combs, but if you prefer a brush, buy a much smaller one than you currently use. Keep charging cables easily accessible in front or side pockets of your bag or backpack.

We have paid for a 1 way nonstop flight on American Airlines and wanted the flight we paid for to help make things easier with our children during the long flight.

Is there a website where I can see what flights are flying on what days, regardless of ticket availability? (Somewhat like how I can look on Google and see what exact time a flight landed a week ago). the reason I ask this is because I'm not sure if that originally planned direct flight is still planning on flying that route or not.

Even if, in the terms and conditions, they can do anything they want with my flight (which seems ridiculous by the way - for example what if someone paid for Non-Stop and then they got changed months ahead to a 2 stopper even though they paid the much higher rate for the nonstop flight), what ground can I stand on to try to have them compensate for this..? 

I might try to have them put me on a flight 1 day earlier that is direct, but then we'd be missing a day of our vacation..

Is it possible for them to put me on a direct the same day with another airline? (Genuinely asking, if it's a stupid question, please be kind)..

We all waited at the gate for about 2 hours, while they assured us the crew was on the way, and we would board as soon as the captain arrived. Eventually, we were told the flight was cancelled.

At the desk, they said the coded reason was that it was cancelled due to weather, and therefore they could not provide us with hotel accommodation, even though nobody the first available flights were for tomorrow.

On August 26th I am flying with American Airlines from Santa Barbara, CA to Pittsburgh, PA. I was to depart at 7:30 PM (PST) and land in Pittsburgh at 9:30 AM (EST) the next day. Two transfers at Phoenix and Charlotte. Long flight but it worked for us.

A few days after I booked and paid, I got an email saying that I would now be departing Santa Barbara at 12:35 PM, which effectively shaves off 7 hours of my precious California vacation. And there'll be a 12 hour layover in Charlotte in the middle of the night. And I'm actually going to arrive in Pitt two hours *later* than originally planned.

I'm planning on calling customer service asap to tell them this is no good for me, but I'm really beta and I've never been the type to demand a supervisor or start throwing a fit until I get what I want.

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

‚Äã

‚Äã","['Rule out JetBlue because they only fly to JFK and BOS from SAN, so while they might work for your northeast travels they won‚Äôt help you for the midwest. \n\nSouthwest is the dominant airline at SAN but they don‚Äôt have extra legroom seats and lack power ports which might make it hard to work through the flight. \n\nPretty much all airlines with extra legroom seats will let you book them if you pay extra for them. Are you looking for one that will let you book the extra legroom seats for free once you achieve an elite status level in their frequent flyer program?', ""Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, but I'm not seeing the differences between the airlines you mentioned regarding their approach to seats with extra legroom. If you don't have status, you have to pay for it. So this isn't a deciding factor. But basic seats on JetBlue tend to have slightly more legroom. "", 'Thank you for taking the time to comment. I apologize for my lack of clarity. After discussing with another commenter I realized I was confused about the ""Extra"" packages and that they\'re similar across all main airlines. And since domestic travel is apparently insufficient for status, though I am planning on doing some international traveling next summer, I am unsure if there is any value to sticking with 1 rewards program. With my situation, do you think this is the best course of action?', 'Sorry for the confusion, some airlines let you buy exit row in advance, unbundled with ""premium"" features without being status (i.e. American), while others don\'t (Alaska, United, Delta). But I am willing to stick with one of the latter airlines if their rewards plan or coverage is much better. Do you have any advice on that? \n\nThanks!', 'I read through the other conversation too. You\'re right that to get the extra legroom seats with Delta, you have to buy Comfort+ as a separate class of travel, whereas with United you can buy a regular Economy/Coach ticket and then choose and pay extra for an Economy Plus seat, which sounds like what you want. I think American does something similar with Main Cabin Extra, though I don\'t know how much of their domestic fleet has MCE as something more than just the bulkhead and exit rows. Be wary of American\'s ""preferred"" seats, which are regular seats but towards the front of the plane. No extra legroom or anything with those.\n\nAlaska looks the same as United with ""Premium Class"" seats being economy class tickets that you pay extra to choose those seats.\n\nOne thing you might consider is United offers a ""subscription"" to Economy Plus, where you pay a one time fee ($499 for domestic US excluding Alaska and Hawaii) and that lets you select Economy Plus seating for an entire year. You\'d have to consider if you\'ll fly enough to make it pay off to do this rather than buying Economy Plus each time, and that also means you\'d basically be dedicated to United. https://www.united.com/CMS/en-US/products/travelproducts/Pages/EconomyPlus.aspx\n\nOne thing to watch out for is Basic Economy fares. You\'re not going to get the option of an extra legroom seat with those.', '> domestic travel is apparently insufficient for status\n\nThat depends entirely on how much you are traveling.

In contrast, Westjet lets you pay say 30$ for booking exit row but gives you the same economy experience. Because I will not have status, upgrades are expensive, so I want airlines that just let me pay for the seats.\n\nI checked for AA for SAN to LGA and I could buy a seat for 75$ while Delta was 120$.

If you're going to be price - sensitive, just book the cheaper flights. Collect points, of course, but you are unlikely to achieve status with repeated domestic flights. *Maybe* you might achieve first tier after ten transcontinental flights, especially if you have a foreign address to avoid United and Delta's spending requirements. "", ""Thank you for clearing things up for me, I realize now that I was not reading things properly. I have a Canadian address but if domestic flights don't do much, then I guess there's no point overthinking it. Will try to stay economical and maybe consider which airline CC has a better offer. "", ""It's not so much that domestic flights themselves don't do much. It's just that the main US airlines (AA, Delta, and United) instituted spending requirements to reach status level, and it's usually tough for leisure travelers to achieve. However, if you are not a US resident (ahem), then you can be exempt for Delta and United.\n\nWith first tier on all three, I believe you are entitled to free extra legroom seats at check-in. That's the only benefit somewhat worth it there, as you can get a credit card that gives you (almost) everything else. ""]"

28,Does this flight fall under US or EU rules of compensation?,2,avfxps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/avfxps/does_this_flight_fall_under_us_or_eu_rules_of/,13,1551317149.0,"So I've got a bit of an odd question. Back in August I book a flight from DFW (Dallas) to London Gatwick, with a connection in Reykjavic (and a stopover in Iceland on the way back).

Then about 5 months later, Icelandair has decided they don't want to fly out of DFW any longer, and give me an extra connection on both ends of the flight. It then becomes a flight from DFW to Boston, Boston to Reykjavic, and Reykjavic to London. 

The flight from DFW to Boston was cancelled, resulting in a full 24 hour delay. I'm not 100% sure of the cause of the cancellation, something mechanical problem with the plane. But the cancelled flight was operated by JetBlue. Since I bought the ticket on an EU airline with a destination in the EU, am I covered under their compensation rules?

30,Fianc√© involuntarily bumped from CONNECTING flight after first leg was delayed - Seeking Compensation,17,bwr8ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/bwr8ea/fianc√©_involuntarily_bumped_from_connecting/,12,1559697114.0,"Hopefully this is the correct subreddit for this.

&#x200B;

My fianc√© had a American Airlines (AA) flight booked from Houston (IAH) -> Miami (MIA) -> Sao Paulo, Brazil (GRU).

Seeing that her first leg was delayed (50 min), she arrived early at the check-in desk in Houston and asked the lady if she thought she would make it in time to board the next flight or if she should look for alternate flights now. She lady repeatedly assured her that she would make on time and be allowed to board her connection. Upon boarding, she asked the stewardess to make sure that all passengers that need to make the same connection be allowed to exit the plane first. The stewardess assured her, as well, that they were in fact going to make it in time for her to board her connection.

She raced out of the plane after landing in Miami, quickly made it to the gate, and boarded the plane‚Ä¶only to be removed shortly after. They had given her seat to someone else because she wasn't at the gate 15 minutes prior to boarding. They booked her a flight on LATAM Airlines for the next morning because the next AA flight to Sao Paolo wouldn‚Äôt leave until next evening. This flight would not arrive until nearly 10 hours after her originally booked arrival time.

&#x200B;

Seeing as she would have to spend the evening, she asked for and was (originally) denied a hotel voucher. AA finally gave in and gave her a hotel voucher after much deliberation. With voucher in hand, she took the last shuttle for the day from the airport to the hotel only to be informed by the front-desk attendant that they had no rooms available. Apparently, the AA employee was told that over the phone when they had called to make the reservation! Eventually the front-desk attendant was able to get in touch with AA and get her a reservation for the next hotel over.

&#x200B;

Fast-forward to next morning, she went to the airport early and made sure everything was in order at both the AA and LATAM desks, which was a good idea since she found out AA had, in fact, not booked her flight yet (she only had a printed itinerary), but that was quickly taken care of. She also made sure that her baggage had been transferred onto her new LATAM flight. The AA employee ensured her that was the case. She gets on the LATAM flight, lands in Sao Paulo, and, of course, her baggage is lost.

After much searching, I believe that she in entitled to monetary compensation based on Federal Regulation **14 CFR ¬ß 250.5** (Amount of denied boarding compensation for passengers denied boarding involuntarily) to the tune of 400% of a one-way flight ticket from Miami to Sao Paulo ($1,350 maximum). This is because her new arrival time to her final (international) destination was over 4 hours later than the original booked arrival time.

&#x200B;

What she has done:

1. Tried to communicate with American Airlines on Twitter (she was told to work this out with the AA desk at the airport)
2. Filed a complaint on the Department of Transportation website
3. Filed a complaint on the American Airlines website

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** Fianc√©‚Äôs seat on connection was given away because she wasn‚Äôt at the gate 15 minutes prior to boarding, even though her first leg was delayed. She was booked a flight that wouldn‚Äôt arrive at her final destination until nearly 10 hours later than her original booked arrival time. I believe she entitled monetary compensation.

&#x200B;

I am understandably furious about the whole situation and have been walking her through every step of this process. Is there any other action she or I can take in this regard? It sucks feeling so helpless.","[""She is not entitled to compensation. 14 CFR 250 only applies to oversold flights. She was not bumped from the flight because it was oversold, but because she got there after the check-in cutoff time.\n\nEven if the flight was oversold:\n\n>**¬ß250.6   Exceptions to eligibility for denied boarding compensation.**  \n>A passenger denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight shall not be eligible for denied boarding compensation if:\n\n>(a) The passenger does not comply fully with the carrier's contract of carriage or tariff provisions regarding ticketing, reconfirmation, check-in, and acceptability for transportation;\n\nAmerican requires international passengers to be at the gate 15 minutes before departure or they lose their seats.\n\nHer seat was more than likely given to a standby passenger.\n\nEdit: AA outsources hotel bookings to a third party company called Travelliance that makes the reservations and then puts them in the computer for agents to print out vouchers.

No recourse. \n\nIf the first flight was delayed due to weather AA will give you nothing. \n\nIf it‚Äôs another reason - mechanic or airport ops you may get a voucher credit for a future flight.', 'I have a problem with this.

2) Any recommendations on airlines/programs to use in order to maximize rewards? Star Alliance has Singapore Airlines, Asiana, United, and Air New Zealand.

American Main Cabin Extra (MCE), Delta Comfort Plus (Comfort+), United Economy Plus (Economy+) are economy cabin seats with some enhancements, they are not comparable to true premium economy service from airlines such as BA or Lufthansa.

In the last year we have seen several corporations convert from Premium Economy services on European airlines to Economy Plus on American airlines based on ""better pricing"". This is a downgrade. These services are not equal, American MCE can't compare to BA World Traveller Plus, United EconomyPlus can't compare to Lufthansa Premium Economy.

Unfortunately, this is catching out many unfamiliar corporate travellers who are not aware these Economy Plus seats are vastly inferior with much reduced leg room and seat width as well as regular Economy food and drink.

If you do have any say in choosing between these services or influencing your corporate travel agreements, please compare products directly rather than assuming equivalence from names.

41,"Big price hike (~$1000) for business multi-city, hitting refresh or bad luck?",0,aek1xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/aek1xq/big_price_hike_1000_for_business_multicity/,11,1547163253.0,"I was planning the following:

1. 20th April TLV (Tel Aviv) - LAX (Los Angeles International)
2. 3rd May LAX - AMS (Amsterdam Schipol)
3. 6th May AMS - TLV

After searching on Google Flights (multi-city, 1 adult, business), I found the ideal itinerary for \~$2800 (numbers correspond):

1. Iberia (sold by American) A330s changing at Madrid
2. BA (sold by American)  A380 / A320 changing at LHR London Heathrow
3. BA A321 / 777 also changing at LHR

When I clicked on the ""book with American Airlines"" button, it took me to American's booking portal. It didn't specify (there) if the flights were indeed business or economy. There was a clue that it said two checked in bags, but nothing other than that. When I tried the same itinerary direct on their site (not via Google Flights), there were differences:

* The third leg flight wasn't available.
* The lowest business price was higher (around $3500).
* The flights were shown as ""Business"" etc.

So rather than book, I called AA. They were mostly unhelpful (friendly but I could tell the rep didn't have deep system knowledge), but said ""the integration with Google Flights can be funny, try booking it, then you can call us with the booking reference and we can confirm, you have 24 hours to get a full refund"".

So I hit refresh to book, and suddenly, the $2800 had become $3700 for the same trip! I don't know if this is bad luck, if the rep flagged some anomaly in the system, or  if hitting refresh a lot as I searched around, and sending the links to my colleagues, was a schoolboy error.

I can't believe that this itinerary suddenly became so popular as to go from $2800 to $3700. What's the smartest thing to do next? Should I wait a few days and search again? Is there any way to know if this is the system artificially inflating prices, or did I just get really unlucky and the price happened to jump whilst I was on the phone with the rep? If it's the former, how long will the prices take to come back down to earth (relatively)?

42,Baby due next month. What are my options for flying my family out given the uncertainty of when the child will arrive?,8,74rq2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/74rq2s/baby_due_next_month_what_are_my_options_for/,10,1507364724.0,"My girlfriend is pregnant and due on November 5. We live in Los Angeles.

My family is excited to meet their grandson/nephew. They live in New York.

I'm trying to figure out the best option for them to travel out here since we can't say for sure when the baby will arrive. They can't stay indefinitely as everyone needs to minimize time off work. Here are some options I've already explored through American and United:

1. Buy a fully refundable ticket. This is absurdly expensive; it's cheaper to just buy a last-minute ticket.

2. Buy a last-minute ticket. Obviously better than option 1, but this still runs about $700 per round trip ticket. Yikes.

3. Buy tickets now and hope the baby comes on time. But changing flights incurs a $200 fee plus the difference in airfare, which is more than option 2.

4. Use rewards miles to buy them tickets now. If they have to change flights, I'd only need to make up the difference in mileage required. So if I get my mom a ticket for Nov 5 for 15K miles and my gf goes into labor on Nov 1 and a last minute ticket is 20K miles, I'd just have to fork over the additional 5K miles. But I can't make up the difference in cash, so if I don't have enough miles (like if the last minute ticket is 75K miles), then I can't do anything about it. And if she doesn't end up using the Nov 5 flight at all, I have to pay a fee of $150 to reclaim those miles or I forfeit them.

5. Use trip insurance. Buy separate flights for Nov 1, Nov 6, and Nov 11. If the baby doesn't arrive by Nov 1, cancel that flight and eat the insurance (like $50). And then repeat for the second flight, and definitely fly the third (baby can't come much later than that). The only problem is the fine print on those insurance policies; I think you can only cancel your trip if you have qualified excuses like a medical problem, etc. How stingy are airlines about using the insurance? Can you just say, ""Hey, I'm not taking this flight"", and they just say, ""You have insurance, so no worries."" This plan also requires laying out money for three flights, but that's what credit cards are for, I guess.

Does anyone have any better ideas? It doesn't seem right that families should have to choose between paying triple the normal cost of a flight or meeting their grandchild. They used to offer bereavement fares, but apparently those are gone now. I was hoping there was something similar for births. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","[""I think you can rule out Option 5. Insurance doesn't work the way you think it does. And, yes, Option 1 is ridiculously expensive.\n\nWhere do you have miles? The maximum amount of miles needed for a flight is known and published, at least on the legacy carriers. It wouldn't cost 75,000 miles, but award seats can become unavailable.\n\nI would just go with booking tickets last minute or, better, going with Southwest, which has flexible booking policies."", 'I think the middle and top tier of Southwest flights allow you to switch the date without a change fee; you just have to pay the cost difference for the new flight.', 'I\'m sure your family is really anxious to meet the newest member of the family, but why not just have the family come to you for Thanksgiving? It would be too long a wait unless the baby comes really early, and would solve a lot of the whole ""what dates should I book for"" hassle. Granted if they have plans for thanksgiving this is all moot, but just a thought to ease the stress', 'Pick a time, schedule a c-section.  ', ""A frequent flyer redemption is best, as the flexibility of those tickets is one of their biggest advantages.\n\nAfter that, just buy last minute. It is what it is for price, but any of the other options don't really make sense."", ""I believe all of Southwest's fares allow you to do that. "", 'Yeah, we\'ve kind of decided on something similar.\n\nThanksgiving wasn\'t gonna happen: too many commitments for them back East. But they\'re all gonna err on the late side and book flights for a week after the due date. Ideally, the kid arrives late and they get to see him as a brand newborn. Worst case, they meet him when he\'s a week old.\n\nIt just makes the most sense from a financial standpoint. I just wish I had the money to say, ""don\'t worry, mom and dad. Just be ready to leave at a moment\'s notice"" and then buy them both last minute tickets.\n\nOh well. Thanks for the suggestion.

I could not reach China Southern the same day since all their lines were busy. I had to buy a new ticket through American Airlines the next day from Beijing to DFW to LAX for $350. I had to stay one night and ate one meal. 1.5 months later, I got a partial refund back from China Southern due to the cancellation of $250. I submitted a claim under Flight Cancellation/ Interruption for a $100 reimbursement flight ticket (difference of the AA flight compared to China Southern flight), $100 for the hotel stay, and $50 for the extra meal. This was submitted all together. I got a reply today that it was denied due to:

New airfare/transportation costs are not covered under the program. The benefit provides coverage for eligible unused prepaid expenses.

I was under the impression that everything would be covered, but I guess it's only for flights already prepaid and if the airline does not reimburse you (which is highly unlikely, since you couldn't take the flight). So am I correct to think that this flight cancellation/ interruption benefit isn't all that great? What would you guys do if in my situation where your return flight got cancelled?

I'm not an experienced flyer and have two questions regarding my upcoming journey.
This Monday I'll be flying from Amsterdam to NYC with Norwegian Airlines and then a couple of hours later NYC (same airport) to Nashville with American Airlines. My first question concerns checked baggage for American Airlines.
- For all previous flights I have made I had to book checked baggage manually and payed extra. I was not offered that option when booking my (domestic) flight with American Airlines. I have looked at all relevant pages on their website three times already, but I can't seem to find any information whether or not one suitcase of checked baggage is automatically included or not (and where I could book it if it's not). Anyone knows is this is included (or necessary to book beforehand)?
- Second question concerns my baggage. I know how to check it in in Amsterdam, but am I supposed to pick it up in NYC and then deliver it again or is it supposed to go automatic? Should I declare this to the airport/airline in any way?

I really hope someone could help me, it would be of great help!

So I just arrived to Augusta, for my flight to Charlotte, and made it through security.  As I'm gathering my things from security, I see a girl holding a tiny chihuahua.  Nothing too strange about that.  Then I hear one of the security personnel comment on how cute the dog is and ask her if she had a carrier with her.  The girl commented that no, she was carrying the dog on the plane and that it was a service dog... 

I mean I know some people pay online to have their dogs declared as service dogs but this was the first red flag about this girl.  I figured whatever. It's not bothering me so I don't care right?  

I make my way to the gate and sit down to wait for boarding for my flight to begin.  I see this girl walking around still carrying the dog and I begin to wonder to myself if this dog ever walks on it's own.  A few minutes later I see her walking towards me and she sits down next to me with her dog and starts to unwrap this pink popsicle looking food.  She starts eating it but is slowly pulling back the wrapper and letting the dog lick it.  Again, not bothering me, so I don't care.

When the person at the gate starts calling for people to board the girl instantly stands up and asks if they allow people with medical conditions to board first.... I would later come to hear her saying to a flight attendant on the plane that she had broken her tailbone and had some sort of spine issue.  She claimed her tailbone was broken due to a rough landing... 

So we are all getting ready walking out on the tarmac to board the plane when one of the personnel tells her that she can't bring her carry on and store it in the overhead compartments on the plane.  This is where things go from 0-100.  This girl starts screaming at the person helping people on the plane saying that she knows her bag will fit and that she needs it because her medication is on the plane.  The woman kindly tells her that she can take her medication out of the bag if she needs it but she cant bring her bag on the plane.

The girl continues to scream and swear at the flight attendant and all I can think is omg who does this girl think she is talking like that to people?  She tells the flight attendant that she wants to know her name and that shes going to be filing complaints against her and American airlines.  I just laugh as I walk by and shake my head but apparently this arguing went on for another 10 minutes while we were boarding.  They even threatened to put her on the no fly list if she didn't get on the plane because she was holding everyone up and acting extremely hostile.

At this point while I'm in my seat I think well at least I'm safe now right and we can finally relax.... nope.  This girl walks down the aisle and asks me, ""is this 17A?""  FML...  SHE SITS IN THE WINDOW SEAT RIGHT NEXT TO ME.   Now I'm just praying she doesn't start talking to me.  I politely tell her my seat belt is under her and I ask if I can get it.  I do and buckle up for a rough flight.  

This girl pulls out her cellphone and calls someone and immediately starts screaming about how the flight attendant started trying to ""physically rip"" her bag out of her hands away from her.  She said she would be filing a complaint with corporate and that none of the attendants would tell her their names.  No shit.  She continues screaming at this guy named Tom apparently on the phone and says, ""I'm never flying out of Augusta again.  Augusta is a fucking podunk, piece of shit airport with fucking drug addict security personnel."" She keeps screaming on the phone and everyone around me is laughing and telling me that I can move and sit with them if I want.  I was obviously uncomfortable with the situation and I wasn't trying to hide it.

Then the flight attendant walks by and she yells at the flight attendant to check and make sure her bag was on the plane... the flight attendant told her it was and assured her it was fine.  The girl then yells that she has a broken tailbone from a rough landing on a plane before.  She demands that they grab her pink flower pillow from her bag so she can have it fir her tailbone.  2 personnel with vests go grab her pillow and bring it on the plane.  Mind you this entire time she is still yelling at this Tom guy on her phone about how retarded he is for making her fly out of Augusta and that yes she knows what state she is going to.... apparently Tom was trying to calm her down and she asked him if he thought she was ""fucking stupid"".  I feel bad for Tom.  He caught the brunt of her anger over the phone.

Everyone around me was laughing and hoping she would be kicked off the plane and I just wanted to move away from her.  Luckily, some seats opened up a few rows up and they let me move up.  They told me I earned it for having to sit next to her and listen to all that.

Finally made it to the airport after only a 30-40 minute flight.  Headed to Dallas next.  Let's hope this next one is uneventful.

Trying to fly from Phoenix to Bangkok. Normally, I would just go from LA, but given it's a hub for American, the price differential seems to be less departing from Phoenix than it would cost me to get to LA first.

Every itinerary I can find has two stops, and that's fine- and almost all route through either Hong Kong or Tokyo.

Now, I've never been to either of those places, and neither has my girlfriend, so we're trying to stop over there. 

Essentially, the requirements, between the voucher rules and our wants, are:

- Has to be available/marketed as American Airlines flights (I got told American has to be the ""primary"" or ""overseas"" carrier, however I think if it's an ""AA"" flight that is operated by another airline, that's acceptable) which essentially means I need to be able to find that price/itinerary on American's site, or be brought there via google flights, etc.

- +6 hour layovers in Tokyo (very very preferably Haneda) one direction and Hong Kong the other- for exactly how long and which direction of the itinerary is somewhat irrelevant- even interested in overnight layovers, as long as they're in those two cities.

- ~$850 or less per ticket. Seen it as low as $650, but we just don't want to go higher than $850. 

- 2-3 weeks (2 1/2 would be perfect) most preferably in November, but any time after Oct. 16th and into the first week of December would be fine.


American's site has driven me bonkers and repeatedly, when I click on a flight option, it loads for 5 seconds and tells me ""that flight is not available, please select another"". 

I have found itineraries that are just slightly off my criteria or end up as the ""flight not available"" site glitches multiple times- I know it exists and is possible, and even overnight options have been listen on google flights.

Saturday, April 27th, we had our American Airlines flight (executed by British Airways) to London Heathrow, where we had our connecting flight to JFK by American Airlines. Due to Weather conditions (They said so), our flight got delayed, so we couldn‚Äôt make it on our second flight to JFK (This flight even departed earlier). We were told to go to the connections desks, which after a long wait told us we had to stay at a hotel and leave the next morning to catch our rebooked Lufthansa flight to Frankfort (FRA). Here we had another connecting flight to JFK from Delta. When we arrived slightly late at Frankfurt Airport we ran to catch our next Delta flight. We didn‚Äôt even had the Check-in tickets yet; this caused us to never make in in time and we yet again got us rebooked at a British Airways Helpdesk. At the end, all 4 of us would split up in 2 groups to still arrive at JFK in the evening of Sunday, we insisted in doing it, as our last hope. We went as fast as we could to the Lufthansa Helpdesk to get our tickets, but they said the information provided by British Airways was not complete and the time period was way to narrow to still make the flight. After this huge disappointment we decided to cancel our trip, since our 5 days at New York would turn to 3, which just wouldn‚Äôt made it worth it.

With our already more than 24 hours delay, our airline clearly made some big mistakes. Off course we cannot help the first delay (since weather conditions), but getting rebooked twice on flights that were impossible to make (the Lufthansa helpdesk employee that tried to get our tickets confirmed this) is just not right. Now I wondered who is responsible for the mistakes made on our flights; American Airlines or British Airlines and what would be possible in terms of claims or other solutions. 

(\*My English isn‚Äôt the best, so I hope everything is clear ;)","['This sounds so messy because so many parties are involved. The ticket belongs to American Airlines but you were never to even speak to an AA employee because of codeshares. \n\nYour British Airways flight was delayed because of weather (plausible), so they rebooked you on Lufthansa connecting to Delta. BA is in Oneworld, Lufthansa is in Star Alliance, and Delta is in Skyteam... normally airlines like to rebook you on their own airline or at least within their own alliance. The fact that BA put you on LH and DL tells me that seats were scarce and they were doing their best to avoid making you wait days for a seat the next available seat on BA. BA has a reputation for being less than helpful so I‚Äôm surprised they did this for you.  \n\nHowever, there are some unspoken risks when you have a BA agent rebooking an AA ticket on LH and DL... ticket changes can be complex within one alliance so when you get 3 involved you are just asking for something to be missing from the exchange causing a headache down the line. To make it worse, a lot of airport employees have been outsourced and their systems dumbed down so few know what to do when these unusual situations arise. BA might have done everything perfectly during the reissue, but maybe the Lufthansa system didn‚Äôt talk to Delta as it should have causing the boarding passes not to print in time causing you to miss connect in Frankfurt. \n\nGood luck getting any of these airlines to take the blame. You can start with AA, but they will probably tel you to go to one of the airlines that you were actually going to fly on. BA will probably tell you to talk to Lufthansa because they should have made sure you were checked in. Delta won‚Äôt do anything because they will say the exchange was done wrong by BA or LH. All of them will probably tell you to go to Expedia who will say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt do anything because the airlines took over the ticket so contact AA‚Äù.

Couldn't find this by googling or searching the site. It's not a flight price issue as such but rather is a mismatch of actual flights between Kayak and the AA site. 

&nbsp;

I am booking a multi-stop return flight and was checking prices via Kayak. I got what seems to be a great deal on Kayak with AA and it says the provider is American Airlines, not multiple airlines or a third party site etc. I can click the deal to take me to the AA site and I can proceed all the way to the final payment.

&nbsp;

I just decided to double check on the AA site properly and I can't find the return flight option at all. I can match the Kayak flight out with the airline's site (not sure if price is the same for that leg), but the Kayak departure and subsequent stops are not available on the AA site.

&nbsp;

I think I might take the chance and book it because it's all via the AA site, but I'm slightly concerned that if I book it and they claim that it isn't valid that I'll end up in a protracted argument to get my money back. Also I'm not based in the States so that might complicate things further.

I know I'm a almost a year out from the flight but some airlines let you pick seats when you get the ticket and I've seen a lot of conflicting information online about the seat selection process. I got two tickets and just want to be sure we sit next to each other! When I bought the tickets AA never gave me options for seats; so I have ""--"" on my tickets for seats. So here's the conflicting reports of what I've read so far:

* JAL flights through AA can't check in (and get seats) until 72 hours before the flight
* JAL flights through AA can't be checked in (and get seats) till you are at the airport day of flight
* You can select seats early if you call AA and ask for the JAL PNR number. Then select flights on JAL's website.
* The same as above BUT you HAVE to use the North American version of the website: http://www.ar.jal.com/en/ (which doesn't work anymore? all the links people post are down)
* You have to call JAL to seat select with the PNR ready (or info on your AA tickets ready)
* You have to call AA and they will check in for you and select your seats when the time comes?
* The class of your ticket matters on how you get to select seats. These are all the Economy classes and I've seen mixed answers for which can pick seats before checking in at the airport: Y, H, K, M, V, Q, S, N, L, O and B (I'm in Q class which is low tier. Prob because the ticket was on sale).

Anyone else have experience with seat selection on JAL booked through AA?","['I\'m really curious where some of this ""conflicting information"" comes from. For example, a quick Google search for ""JAL check in time"" indicates 24 hours, which is standard for flights from the US as well.\n\nI have no idea why you anyone would think AA would check you in. And the rest of the theories are close enough to not be an impediment. Don\'t think you *have* to use the North American site, but if you\'re in the US you\'ll probably get there anyway.\n\n""All of the links people post are down""? Dude, just google ""JAL""...

Thank you!"", ""What same issue? It's not clear what you're contesting. Get the JAL PNR and try selecting on their website or calling them. Sounds like you haven't even taken the step of acquiring that. And that's fine; your flight is almost a year away. But then it's also premature to come here."", ""I just went through picking seats for an AA JAL code share from US to Japan. You've probably figured this out by now but I'm posting my results since I found this thread by googling and I've also found a lot of misinformation (or old info).\n\nWhat worked for me: Called AA reservation service about picking seats. My first call gave me the PNR number and told me to contact JAL. I tried using the PNR on the JAL website and it couldn't find my reservation. Called JAL and they told me AA would pick the seats for me... Called AA back and the new guy got me seats in like 2 mins. IDK what the issue with the first call was but AA should just pick your seats for you if you call (otherwise you'll get them when you check in).""]"

I've been researching prices on ITA Matrix for around a month to notice trends since we don't plan on getting tickets until November.

Before when I looked, the cheapest option was always United or United+ANA. Now it's American. I haven't changed my airport, and this seems to run across all dates I run. Granted, the price is the same, but it adds in an additional layover flight from 1 to 2.

I don't really have a preferred airline. The only reason I'm posting this is because I don't know why there would be such a change?

Try changing the dates by like 2 weeks and see if the prices are still the same?

I finally have an email thread from AA Customer Relations telling me that this controller is OK to use.  I have it printed off and in my travel backpack now.  
\*A few more details about the interaction:  During the flight, I put it away immediately when asked to, but I told her she was incorrect about me not being allowed to use the controller in flight.  For some reason, she came back to me to repeat that the issue was the controller and kept asking me to speak up as I was talking to her, which I did not do because I would not want to be perceived as raising my voice to a flight attendant (in retrospect, I'm suspicious that she might have been trying to trick me into raising my voice).  Instead I spoke with her after the flight on my way off the plane and asked her to confirm with a superior if she was correct.  She was pretty abrasive and commanded me authoritatively to ""Stand right there"" while she spoke to the captain in a way that made me feel like might be in trouble for even questioning if she was correct even though I complied with her request.  She did not say that the captain had confirmed she was correct, and instead asked me to leave the plane and talk to the gate agent.  She also refused to answer what level of attachment would be required to make the controller no longer be considered ""remote"".  


I have been traveling for work for many years, and I often use handheld gaming devices to pass the time in-flight.

Yesterday, I was told that I could not use my wired gamepad because the attendant considered it a ""remote controlled toy"", which is not permitted.  I have been using similar devices for years without issue.  The controller literally touches my device and is connected with a 6"" usb cable.  No bluetooth is used (even though bluetooth keyboards are allowed).

Upon arriving in Charlotte, we parked at a gate without a jetway.  I was tired and walked down the stairs onto the tarmac and somewhat in a daze into the terminal.  I was not more than a foot in the terminal when I realized that my valet-checked bag was sitting on the tarmac next to the plane.

I immediately told the gate attendant that I had left my bag and needed to go get it.  I was still in the entryway to the terminal when I said this.

The gate attendant told me that I could not go back and get my bag.  I said it's right there -- pointing to less than 30 feet from where I was standing and explaining that I had another flight in 20 minutes from a different terminal to catch.

She said that she could not let me go get that bag and if I did she would call the police.  I told her that I thought that was crazy and asked her why on earth she would call the police and was told that ""FAA Rules Prohibit You from Retrieving Your Bag.""

I am a lawyer, but I don't carry that around on my sleeve and rarely anyone outside of my office knows that I am.  I did not tell this gate attendant I was a lawyer but I did say ""Hey, I don't think that's true.  Your gate area and likely the tarmac is leased (or licensed) from the airport authority and I seriously doubt the FAA cares if you let a passenger go get a valet-checked bag.""  I was informed again that the gate agent ""will call the police on you if you set foot through that door.""  So, I got to watch the rest of the passengers deplane and my bag was brought to me 15 minutes later (fortunately, not by the police despite the gate agent's double-threat to call them).  I missed my connection by about 2 minutes.

Setting aside these abysmal conflict management skills, I am really interested in knowing where this big book of FAA Rules I can't find are located.  I've looked in the federal register and the FAA Bulletins, but there's nothing there.  Methinks that this gate agent did not know what the heck she was talking about and that this is probably just a tarmac safety policy (and a silly one at that in this context).

This doesn't change the reality that they wouldn't let you go outside and you missed your connection.\n\nThat isn't necessarily the cause of missing the connection though.

On Sept 14th, I booked a flight from LAX to CLT for Friday, 10/26. I have booked flights often (without mistakes) and even had my girlfriend double-check our flight details during the booking process, yet, when I went back a month later, I saw that my flight was scheduled for the 27th rather than the 26th. I called to sort the issue out and spoke with a manager, Eric. Eric assumed the issue was my own human error, and gave me no choice but to cancel and repurchase the flights, costing me $1,504. During this process, I was not informed that the sale would be final, unlike the majority of airlines which allow cancellations within the first 24 hours. 

When it came time for our flight and I began to check in online, I found that our tickets randomly got canceled. When I spoke to a rep, Ellis, she said that it may have been a glitch in your system and it's not impossible that this glitch also caused the original issue. We were placed on hold while Ellis attempted to resolve the issue, however, in the end, we were never provided with a legitimate flight confirmation via email, and we were given seats we had not selected, even though we chose seats weeks prior. As we were on the call for 37 minutes, we had to start traveling to the airport unsure if we even had a flight to board at all. I checked my bank account, and that cancellation did not show up with any money coming back to me, it just cleared my ticket.

When I contacted their support staff on email, their customer relations rep, Scott, basically told me to pound sand and that I will get no compensation for the change in the date nor them somehow cancelling our tickets altogether.

(same trip, different flight.) So here it is:

 

I booked a flight from Chicago to Copenhagen for my honeymoon through Vayama. (REALLY wish I would have looked at reviews, but too late now) They sent us our e tickets, and they had my name on both tickets instead of my fianc√©‚Äôs name on one of them. I called vayama and they said they can‚Äôt change it. I called Finnair, and Finnair said vayama can change it, and the rep from Finnair asked to do a three way call to add a vayama rep on the line. All of a sudden, Vayama could change the name, and sent the issue over to their NAME CHANGE DEPARTMENT. They asked us to send our passport information, which we did, and they said they‚Äôd change it.

 

A few weeks later, I haven‚Äôt heard anything from vayama, so I call and they said they‚Äôre working on it, and we‚Äôll hear back by next week.

 

A few weeks after that, I called again and they said they‚Äôre still working on it. A few more weeks, and I call and they said they‚Äôre waiting on authorization from Finnair, we‚Äôll hear back in a week or so.

 

After calling them back and them saying they‚Äôre still working on it (‚Äúyou‚Äôll hear from us within 48 hours‚Äù) I called Finnair. I explained the situation, and they were surprised Finnair said it was up to them because they haven‚Äôt heard from Vayama and even if they did, it‚Äôs completely up to Vayama, they don‚Äôt need to approve anything. Called Vayama again, and they said its not up to Finnair, it‚Äôs up to the consolidator of the ticket, American. I called American and talked to them about it and they said no, it‚Äôs up to vayama, they don‚Äôt control anything with the ticket.

 

I called Vayama AGAIN and they said the person I talked to at American AND Finnair were both wrong, and that they need approval from Finnair, American, and the other airline that has a leg of this flight (British air I think?) and they said if I can get it in writing form these airlines that they have no control over the ticket, they‚Äôll ‚Äútake a look at it again.‚Äù

 

I‚Äôm ready to contact every airline involved to get it in writing but I feel like I am being given the run-around here by Vayama to exhaust me until I don‚Äôt care anymore (Joke is on them, this is for my honeymoon so I won‚Äôt stop until this is changed.)

 

The kicker is their BBB profile has multiple complaints by others who experienced the same issue: two people book a flight, and one name is on both tickets.

 

Can anyone explain what is going on here? Is there anything else I can do? I want to get the flight details nailed down before I book hotels, and fortunately the flight is 3 months away.



TL;DR Vayama says they‚Äôre waiting on other airlines for authorization to fix the name on the ticket, but keep changing their story on me and are not doing anything. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I have described the context of the situation below, please could you let me know if you think I‚Äôm eligible for compensation or not?

This flight was booked through British Airways but operated by American Airlines. The issues started when our initial aircraft was discovered to have a hydraulic leak in Miami and consequently was put out of service whilst a replacement aircraft came in from London Heathrow. This delay was approximately 1 hour 30 minutes.

Once we were on the aircraft we were taxiing to the take off when the plane abruptly stopped and an announcement was made asking if there was a certain individual on the plane. Once it became clear this individual was not on the plane the plane returned to the gate. It became apparent that a passenger on the plane had accidentally picked up a piece of baggage that did not belong to them and the person who it did belong to was not onboard the flight, therefore for security reasons the piece of luggage had to be removed from the plane.

Once the security staff had interviewed the passenger and carried out a search of the aircraft we departed from Miami. We landed at London Heathrow approximately 2 hours 30 minutes later than expected. However as we began taxiing to the gate our path became blocked by departing aircraft. The key fact is here that by the time we got to the gate and the First door opened on the plane the time was just past 12:01, meaning that the plane was now over 3 hours later (3 hours 1 minute). Under EU regulation, the time of arrival is the point at which the aircraft door opens and the first passenger was able to disembark.

I received this reply from AA today:

As you have correctly identified, European Union Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 of the European Parliament and Council has established common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of cancellations or long delays of flights. Under this regulation, in the event of a flight cancellation or delay, passengers are entitled to established levels of compensation. However, this regulation does not apply when a flight is cancelled or delayed for less than 3-hours, flight is departing from the United States or a flight is cancelled or delayed due to weather or Air Traffic Control issues. Since flight 1529 was delayed because of non-qualifying reason situation, American Airlines is not required to provide the compensation you have referred to.



Based on the above, do I have any grounds or is it dead in the water? I can‚Äôt see how it isn‚Äôt a qualifying reason?

168,Brewing Weather‚Äîchange flight or wait with American Airlines?,1,car217,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/car217/brewing_weatherchange_flight_or_wait_with/,1,1562649299.0,"Tropical Storm Barry currently has an 80% chance of rolling into the Gulf of Mexico this week/weekend, which is when I plan to fly into TLH via American Airlines. I've read that I can change my flight to another unrelated flight some time in the future while only paying the difference in flight costs. Is that true?
  
Secondly, I've seen mention that airlines will refund flights in the event that the tropical weather forces cancellation, which seems like it might be better for me, in other words: waiting for the carrier to cancel. Is that a real possibility here?

All this to say: what's the recommended course of action here?","['Wait. If the storm turns toward your destination, American will enact a travel notice allowing changes completely free of charge. If you stay with your original flights and they get cancelled, you can get a full refund as well.']"
169,Is an hr layover at the Madrid airport long enough?,2,451e6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/451e6n/is_an_hr_layover_at_the_madrid_airport_long_enough/,1,1455114262.0,I'll be flying out of Chicago and landing in Madrid I will have an hr layover and I will have to switch terminals (4s to 4) before heading to Italy. This being my first time flying international I'm rather nervous is an hr going to long enough even with my terminal change? Also I'm flying with American Airlines then switching to Iberia once I reach Madrid will I have to claim my luggage?,"[""I answered you in the /r/spain thread, but I'll copy the reply here as well should anyone end up here from google in the future.\n\nFirst, you aren't going to by flying with American, you will be flying with Iberia from Chicago though it may be sold with an American Airlines code. IB is the only airline that flies ORD-MAD.\nI'm assuming you bought this as one ticket and if so, you have nothing to worry about. If you don't make it, then you will be just placed onto the next flight.\n\nWhen you check in at Chicago, make sure that they check your luggage all the way to your final destination. Just see that the tag has the 3 letter code of the airport you will be flying to (these can be weird in Italy so learn it). MXP for Milan Malpensa LIN for Milan Linate, VCE for Venice, FCO for Rome are the main ones.\n\nSo now for when you land, you'll go out and up some ramps down to the central area of T4S where you will go through passport control. This rarely takes more than 5 minutes. Then you have to go down to the inter-terminal train (pro-tip, take the elevator, not the escalators) and get to T4. From there follow the signs to connections and you will go through security again and be ready to go.\n\nIt is within the minimum connection time at the airport and IB6274 usually arrives a bit early.""]"

For example, flying from dca to sju in February will run you $275 on American Airlines. After noticing this flight had a connection in PHL, I searched a multicity booking of DCA-PHL-SJU-PHL-DCA. This combination results I  a round-trip fair of $215. I've booked this multiple times over the past year and saved a ton in the process. Also, they will check your bag for the whole flight(DCA-SJU) which was one of my initial concerns with booking this way.",[]
