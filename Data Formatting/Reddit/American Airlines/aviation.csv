With multiple trucks they can usually do this to fit their training or fill/empty schedule.  The big US airlines currently have about 1.5 pilots retiring per day which for the big 4 is about 6 pilots a day countrywide.  Some don't get to do a last flight due to medical or physical limitations and some are just ready to hang it up and don't realize they have operated their last flight.  A majority of the retiring guys are generally flying widebodies international and are concentrated at certain airports where the fireman may or may not want to do this or get a little tired of doing this.

3,An interesting spin on Asian flight training culture,178,1hyd5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1hyd5b/an_interesting_spin_on_asian_flight_training/,84,1373426692.0,"
Subject: B-777 Accident Observations




Interesting. I got rid of names, but I ride with the fellow that sent it to me. An ex Navy jet jock and retired UAL pilot when they made a ton of money.



Got this on my retired UAL pilot forum from a fellow I knew both in the Navy and at UAL. We were in the same cadet officer class back in 1965. He went on to fly A-7's and F-8's and later to Eastern Airlines and to UAL after Eastern's bankruptcy. While at UAL he worked in the training center as an instructor most of the time. I happened to check him out in the B737 for the ""flying the line"" portion of training. He is a good pilot and has an excellent background, so I respect his opinion. Regarding the recent B-777 accident at SFO: 



After I retired from UAL as a Standards Captain on the ‚Äì400, I got a job as a simulator instructor working for Alteon (a Boeing subsidiary) at Asiana. When I first got there, I was shocked and surprised by the lack of basic piloting skills shown by most of the pilots. It is not a normal situation with normal progression from new hire, right seat, left seat taking a decade or two. One big difference is that ex-Military pilots are given super-seniority and progress to the left seat much faster. Compared to the US, they also upgrade fairly rapidly because of the phenomenal growth by all Asian air carriers. By the way, after about six months at Asiana, I was moved over to KAL and found them to be identical. The only difference was the color of the uniforms and airplanes. I worked in Korea for 5 long years and although I found most of the people to be very pleasant, it‚Äôs a minefield of a work environment ... for them and for us expats.



One of the first things I learned was that the pilots kept a web-site and reported on every training session. I don‚Äôt think this was officially sanctioned by the company, but after one or two simulator periods, a database was building on me (and everyone else) that told them exactly how I ran the sessions, what to expect on checks, and what to look out for. For example; I used to open an aft cargo door at 100 knots to get them to initiate an RTO and I would brief them on it during the briefing. This was on the B-737 NG and many of the captains were coming off the 777 or B744 and they were used to the Master Caution System being inhibited at 80 kts. Well, for the first few days after I started that, EVERYONE rejected the takeoff. Then, all of a sudden they all ‚Äúgot it‚Äù and continued the takeoff (in accordance with their manuals). The word had gotten out. I figured it was an overall PLUS for the training program.



We expat instructors were forced upon them after the amount of fatal accidents (most of the them totally avoidable) over a decade began to be noticed by the outside world. They were basically given an ultimatum by the FAA, Transport Canada, and the EU to totally rebuild and rethink their training program or face being banned from the skies all over the world. They hired Boeing and Airbus to staff the training centers. KAL has one center and Asiana has another. When I was there (2003-2008) we had about 60 expats conducting training KAL and about 40 at Asiana. Most instructors were from the USA, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand with a few stuffed in from Europe and Asia. Boeing also operated training centers in Singapore and China so they did hire some instructors from there.



This solution has only been partially successful but still faces ingrained resistance from the Koreans. I lost track of the number of highly qualified instructors I worked with who were fired because they tried to enforce ‚Äúnormal‚Äù standards of performance. By normal standards, I would include being able to master basic tasks like successfully shoot a visual approach with 10 kt crosswind and the weather CAVOK. I am not kidding when I tell you that requiring them to shoot a visual approach struck fear in their hearts ... with good reason. Like this Asiana crew, it didnt‚Äô compute that you needed to be a 1000‚Äô AGL at 3 miles and your sink rate should be 600-800 Ft/Min. But, after 5 years, they finally nailed me. I still had to sign my name to their training and sometimes if I just couldn‚Äôt pass someone on a check, I had no choice but to fail them. I usually busted about 3-5 crews a year and the resistance against me built. I finally failed an extremely incompetent crew and it turned out he was the a high-ranking captain who was the Chief Line Check pilot on the fleet I was teaching on. I found out on my next monthly trip home that KAL was not going to renew my Visa. The crew I failed was given another check and continued a fly while talking about how unfair Captain Brown was.



Any of you Boeing glass-cockpit guys will know what I mean when I describe these events. I gave them a VOR approach with an 15 mile arc from the IAF. By the way, KAL dictated the profiles for all sessions and we just administered them. He requested two turns in holding at the IAF to get set up for the approach. When he finally got his nerve up, he requested ‚ÄúRadar Vectors‚Äù to final. He could have just said he was ready for the approach and I would have cleared him to the IAF and then ‚ÄúCleared for the approach‚Äù and he could have selected ‚ÄúExit Hold‚Äù and been on his way. He was already in LNAV/VNAV PATH. So, I gave him vectors to final with a 30 degree intercept. Of course, he failed to ‚ÄúExtend the FAF‚Äù and he couldn‚Äôt understand why it would not intercept the LNAV magenta line when he punched LNAV and VNAV. He made three approaches and missed approaches before he figured out that his active waypoint was ‚ÄúHold at XYZ.‚Äù Every time he punched LNAV, it would try to go back to the IAF ... just like it was supposed to do. Since it was a check, I was not allowed (by their own rules) to offer him any help. That was just one of about half dozen major errors I documented in his UNSAT paperwork. He also failed to put in ANY aileron on takeoff with a 30-knot direct crosswind (again, the weather was dictated by KAL).



This Asiana SFO accident makes me sick and while I am surprised there are not more, I expect that there will be many more of the same type accidents in the future unless some drastic steps are taken. They are already required to hire a certain percentage of expats to try to ingrain more flying expertise in them, but more likely, they will eventually be fired too. One of the best trainees I ever had was a Korean/American (he grew up and went to school in the USA) who flew C-141‚Äôs in the USAF. When he got out, he moved back to Korea and got hired by KAL. I met him when I gave him some training and a check on the B-737 and of course, he breezed through the training. I give him annual PCs for a few years and he was always a good pilot. Then, he got involved with trying to start a pilots union and when they tired to enforce some sort of duty rigs on international flights, he was fired after being arrested and JAILED!



The Koreans are very very bright and smart so I was puzzled by their inability to fly an airplane well. They would show up on Day 1 of training (an hour before the scheduled briefing time, in a 3-piece suit, and shined shoes) with the entire contents of the FCOM and Flight Manual totally memorized. But, putting that information to actual use was many times impossible. Crosswind landings are also an unsolvable puzzle for most of them. I never did figure it out completely, but I think I did uncover a few clues. Here is my best guess. First off, their educational system emphasizes ROTE memorization from the first day of school as little kids. As you know, that is the lowest form of learning and they act like robots. They are also taught to NEVER challenge authority and in spite of the flight training heavily emphasizing CRM/CLR, it still exists either on the surface or very subtly. You just can‚Äôt change 3000 years of culture.



The other thing that I think plays an important role is the fact that there is virtually NO civil aircraft flying in Korea. It‚Äôs actually illegal to own a Cessna-152 and just go learn to fly. Ultra-lights and Powered Hang Gliders are Ok. I guess they don‚Äôt trust the people to not start WW III by flying 35 miles north of Inchon into North Korea. But, they don‚Äôt get the kids who grew up flying (and thinking for themselves) and hanging around airports. They do recruit some kids from college and send then to the US or Australia and get them their tickets. Generally, I had better experience with them than with the ex-Military pilots. This was a surprise to me as I spent years as a Naval Aviator flying fighters after getting my private in light airplanes. I would get experienced F-4, F-5, F-15, and F-16 pilots who were actually terrible pilots if they had to hand fly the airplane. What a shock!


Finally, I‚Äôll get off my box and talk about the total flight hours they claim. I do accept that there are a few talented and free-thinking pilots that I met and trained in Korea. Some are still in contact and I consider them friends. They were a joy! But, they were few and far between and certainly not the norm.



Actually, this is a worldwide problem involving automation and the auto-flight concept. Take one of these new first officers that got his ratings in the US or Australia and came to KAL or Asiana with 225 flight hours. After takeoff, in accordance with their SOP, he calls for the autopilot to be engaged at 250‚Äô after takeoff. How much actual flight time is that? Hardly one minute. Then he might fly for hours on the autopilot and finally disengage it (MAYBE?) below 800‚Äô after the gear was down, flaps extended and on airspeed (autothrottle). Then he might bring it in to land. Again, how much real ‚Äúflight time‚Äù or real experience did he get. Minutes! Of course, on the 777 or 747, it‚Äôs the same only they get more inflated logbooks.



So, when I hear that a 10,000 hour Korean captain was vectored in for a 17-mile final and cleared for a visual approach in CAVOK weather, it raises the hair on the back of my neck","[""I'm still struggling with how there could have been 3 other pilots in the cockpit and yet no one spoke up, took over, whatever, when the airspeed dropped below 140kts. The senior pilot should have been all over it. Were they asleep? It was a near 11hr flight. Were they expecting the warning to come from the airport system that was turned off? (not trusting their gages....)  They've got some explaning to do. Exemplary response from the flight attendants though."", 'Jesus!

If it flipped once, they would‚Äôve all died.

It is just not done. \n\n', ""Note: What follows is completely anecdotal.\n\nA friend of mine works for Boeing and was telling me a few years ago that when KAL started flying their first 777s, they were wearing through landing gear at a much faster rate than anticipated.  So Boeing setup cameras at one of the airports to see what was happening during landings to cause such wear.  Apparently the pilots were coming in way too hard and hammering the crap out of the gear.  My friend said it was mentioned that pilots were too short and had a hard time seeing the runway as the nose flared up just before touching down.  He also said they measured and found that fuselage was actually bent length-wise somewhat from the hard landings.\n\n\nJust what he told me, so take it with a grain of salt.  Just hearing OP's story made me remember this.

Teaching definitely gives you a different perspective on what need to be learned.

Prior to leaving instructing, I was both book smart and had a good deal of experience that I could confidently handle a move to a commuter.\n\nIf you want to fly crap aircraft, experience pilot-pushing, and generally grow curly hairs on your balls, this is where is happens.  In my day, you either upgraded or you were fired.  Those guys I sat next to new how to fly and new the aircraft right down to the paint specs.  Most were cool and did their best to teach the FOs so once their upgrade came, they\'d have a fighting chance.\n\nI stayed in the right seat if a J-31 for only a year and moved into the left seat of the same aircraft.

This past Sunday I was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 43 from Dallas/Fort Worth to Detroit.

About an hour into the flight, at cruising altitude (edit: in clear air), we encountered some turbulence. Within a few seconds, there was a loud bang and the plane dropped quickly and roughly. While unnerving, this didn't strike me as being terribly rare, as I've heard of air pockets and currents that can cause this kind of thing and I've experienced heavy turbulence before.

Within a few more seconds of continued turbulence, there was a louder bang and the plane banked sharply to the left, then back sharply to the right, then back even more to the left, and even more again to the right. It felt like we were fishtailing in a car, for lack of a better description (on a horizontal axis rather than vertical, maybe 30-35 degrees to each side), in which each swing was farther than the one before. It was horrifying.

We straightened out after that, and the rest of the flight was relatively uneventful. There were no immediate announcements after the fishtail other than the flight attendant telling everyone to fasten their seatbelts. The pilot or first officer came on before we started the descent into Detroit and briefly mentioned something about the turbulence that was difficult to hear.

The only other thing that stood out was that we came in for a landing with the nose down much more than I've ever experienced, and the engine noise at the end of our descent (probably the last 3 minutes or so) was unexpectedly loud. It wasn't a very comfortable landing because of this, but I was relieved to get off the plane.

Any insight into what might have happened?","[""Limit load on airliners is [2.5G](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=23965cc7c025266a4f3a9f96b24b7ef4&node=14:1.0.1.3.11&rgn=div5#14:1.0.1.3.11.3.164.9). Wing structure, which sometimes is a single load path (i.e. if a wing spar fails, you're dead) is [famously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vEfZFx4hk#t=150) required to have a +50% margin of safety, so the wing [does not break](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2010/03/index.jpg) until at least 3.75G. This means that, in a coordinated turn, you can [bank 66.5 degrees without worrying about it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmqLsEhoOzY#t=42) (arccos of 1/2.5), 74.5 degrees without the wings failing catastrophically (arccos of 1/3.75), and even more if you are uncoordinated and/or if you are in non-steady flight e.g. [rolling the airplane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaA7kPfC5Hk#t=112) and only staying at any given bank angle for only a moment.\n\nIf the airplane is sideslipping (which is what I presume you mean by fishtailing, i.e. uncoordinated flight where, [from your point of view](http://xkcd.com/123/), you feel like you're being pushed towards the windows on one side), then the wings are actually not supplying all of the Gs; Some of the load comes from the fuselage and a little from the vertical fin. ([Knife-edge flight](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YN282Ge3eN4/TkPb-gSiwLI/AAAAAAAABYA/cQGrkNlav64/s1600/Oshkosh+2011+144.jpg) is the extreme of this). The vertical fin is also significantly over-designed. There is a nominal bending moment that it sees during normal maneuvering. When the airplane slips sideways into the biggest sideslip angle that it can hold, the load on the vertical fin is almost twice the normal bending moment from normal maneuvering. If the pilot then kicks in opposite rudder, the load briefly becomes [FIVE TIMES](http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2004/2004-09%20-%201667.html) the normal maneuvering load. Boeing airplanes are built to be able to take this without the fin breaking off, and other airliners are built to similar standards.\n\nSo, don't worry about it :]\n\nPS: Airliner structures are not only surprisingly strong, but [also very durable](http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/167icn/question_for_rflying_why_do_aircraft_have_such/c7u0eae?context=1)."", 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_roll', ""Rolling in turbulence is pretty common. Airliners can handle some pretty robust (thunderstorm-level) turbulence, but it's not a fun ride! It doesn't sound like anything unsafe. Without forward view, everything feels magnified, so the rolls probably weren't that steep. But even if they were, 30 degrees of bank is a standard turn. Even 60 degrees is a very basic maneuver, so there's no risk inherent in the degree of roll.\n\nI'm not totally sure about the landing, but it sounds pretty consistent with a landing in a strong quartering crosswind (wind coming from ahead and to the side, like at a 45-degree angle). The pilots are maintaining a particular airspeed and descent angle (losing x feet of altitude for y feet traveled over the ground). \n\nWith a headwind or crosswind, you travel farther in the air than you do over the ground. The way to correct for this is generally to add power.  Stronger winds mean more power.\n\nIf it was particularly gusty, they may have come in faster than normal approach speed, which is normal procedure. It's a little safety buffer in case a gust drops away, dropping your airspeed with it. It's generally better to be a little too fast than a little too slow when you're close to stall speed and close to the ground.\n\nAnyway, coming in faster means your angle of attack is lower. But since your angle of descent is still the same, your nose is pointed lower. However, I'd call it even odds that you were also just shaken up from the earlier experience, and the descent angle felt magnified. \n\nYou don't get comfortable landings in those conditions, for a couple of reasons. For one thing, when it's gusty, your airspeed is constantly changing, and so you can't really time when you hit the runway precisely enough for a smooth landing. The other thing is that, for a variety of reasons, airliners land at an angle to the runway in strong crosswinds. That is, the plane is not pointing in the direction that it's going (down the centerline), so the nose is pointed off to the side. Because of that, when you touch down, the plane is not going in the direction the wheels want it to go, and the nose jerks over to get in line with the runway. It's proper procedure and totally safe, but there's no way to avoid it feeling a bit uncomfortable.\n\nEdit: [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3vap0QjSnA#t=128) an example of what I'm talking about. You can see everything I'm talking about: low nose, high engine power, some ballooning close to the runway, and the big swing of the nose to get lined up."", '>the plane banked sharply to the left, then back sharply to the right, then back even more to the left, and even more again to the right.

Normally the pilot will do this ahead of time by throttling back, but maybe for some reason he needed to lose it fast. Turning like that would be a viable option so as to hold a constant altitude. Or maybe they were trying to do a precise maneuver through weather, sort of like driving down a windy two-lane road.\n\nThis happened on one of my more recent flights, did 5-6 quick turns as you describe to slow down our approach.

This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic [flight dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics) modes (others include [phugoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phugoid), [short period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_period), and [spiral divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_divergence)). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in [damping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping) as [airspeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspeed) decreases and [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude) increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a [yaw damper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_damper). Wings placed well above the center of mass, sweepback ([swept wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swept_wing)) and [dihedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_(aircraft\\)) wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly [anhedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_(aircraft\\)#Anhedral), and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.\n\n>\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Yaw ^damper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_damper) ^| [^Phugoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phugoid) ^| [^Rock ^n ^Roll ^Junkie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_n_Roll_Junkie) ^| [^MS ^Pride ^of ^Rotterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Pride_of_Rotterdam) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ch5zspx) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ch5zspx)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)', ""I am a little shocked it took me so far to scroll down to Dutch roll as the response here, it seems like the obvious technical synonym for fish tailing.

[See here](http://web.mit.edu/jhwill/www/Flight587.html). In other words, the engineers knew that these high loads could happen, and they probably designed the structure accordingly, but the structure then probably lost strength over time in ways that had not been expected or predicted. (I say ""probably"" because I don\'t work for Airbus, but the analyses that lead to these suspicions are compelling, IMO). So this accident can be seen as more of a ""Were they looking appropriately for potential structural degradation over time?"" than as ""Did the loads exceed what the structure had been designed to take?"".\n\nAlso, it was not the ""rapidly moving between directions"" that caused the very high load, at least not primarily. It was the airplane being at a high angle of sideslip, and the rudder being commanded to reach full deflection the other way. As you can read [here](http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2004/2004-09%20-%201666.html) and [here](http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2004/2004-09%20-%201667.html), this causes five times the load that you\'d see at full deflection at maneuvering speeds and zero sideslip. (But yes, this rudder deflection will itself decrease the sideslip, so doing it quickly will create a slightly greater instantaneous load than doing it slowly and only reaching max deflection after the sideslip has decreased).', 'Yes, that\'s what I meant when I said ""when you\'re in non-steady flight"". The extreme example of this is if you get the airplane to its maximum safe speed, and pull up at the maximum safe G loading to get to the maximum instantaneous rate of climb... then lower the nose such that the airplane follows a zero-G parabollic path. (Once the angle of the nose below the horizon is the opposite of what it was above the horizon when you started pushing the nose down, you pull up at max G again, and level out again at almost the max speed, i.e. the maneuver is basically symmetric). During that period of zero G, you can roll the airplane to your heart\'s content (e.g. all the way around), because the airplane is not flying, it\'s in free fall like a cannon ball. This is how the [Vomit Comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_gravity_aircraft) works, how they shot [*Apollo 13*](http://articles.philly.com/1995-07-24/living/25677978_1_zero-gravity-apollo-paxton-and-kevin-bacon)... and you can do it too, [in your own airplane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN77b9DqEbc) or [in a bigger one](http://www.gozerog.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Photos_and_Videos.welcome).', ""I have pilots that have taken my jet (KC-10) to 90 degrees in the sim when practicing scrams.

The A330 went -- as you so helpfully point out -- ten years of ""safe"" operations during which, at any moment, any given A330 might have encountered the AoA corruption bug and suddenly pitched its nose down. That is literally the thing you want to criticize MCAS for doing.\n\nSo, once more, with feeling: this is not unprecedented. What is unprecedented is the reaction.

I was the kind voice on the other end of the phone who helped Platinum and Gold members. Those were the days before 9/11 when standby opportunities were plentiful, and it was easy to fly across the country just to spend the day in Los Angeles and take the redeye home. I knew one girl who would fly RDU ORD RDU in first class just because she could swing two awesome dinners.  I worked on native SABRE, memorized more airline codes than most people know exist, learned who 'Jim Wilson' was, and personally knew team members who assisted families after crashes. That takes a special person. \n\nI am a licensed pilot now and still loooove the airport! Seeing a big AA jet land while I wait to roll onto the runway in a C172 never gets old. I wish the planes were still polished metal. We were told that the lack of paint saved on fuel costs, but I guess they got over that if it was true. Keeping a plane polished is probably quite an effort.\n\nI will say that my years of helping passengers over the phone made me never want to deal with the public again. Most people were nice, but the random punctuation of assholes and outright perverts was unsettling. I can't imagine the strain of working at the airport unless it's at the Admiral's Club where everyone seems to be in a good mood. \n\nAA continues to be my airline of choice.

If we have a delay our customers are affected.  We know that.  We strive to avoid it, but not at all costs.  We won't sacrifice safety. Ever.  It's a great airline with a long history.  If you're on my flight I promise it will be safe and I will do everything I can to make your flight enjoyable.  "", ""Unfortunately what's left from the old American Airlines is the name. US Airways is running the airline. Most of AA's management have been replaced with US Airways. If it's bad now I think it'll get worst. "", 'I have been flying American Airlines since I was a child.  One of my most vivid memories was flying on American a week after 9/11 to JFK.  The plane was half empty, this was back when they flew the ""Luxury Liner"" 767, and the flight attendants treated us like we were in first class, snacks every hour, my parents had all the wine they wanted and I came away with multiple coloring books, deck of cards and a free plane model.  You could tell they were hurting for passengers. \n\nOver all my experience with them hasn\'t been any thing special but I do have a certain sense of reassurance knowing I will get to my destination safe.

Award miles are harder and harder to come by, and exponentially more difficult to redeem. Systemwide upgrade availability is impossible to find - and complimentary upgrades are rarer and rarer.\n\nSo while I have had some amazing times with the airline like I said this will be my last year flying on only their metal. I would absolutely stay loyal if they made it easier to redeem award miles and use their SWUs (which were also reduced to just 4 this year...which wouldn't matter if they were actually guaranteed availability)\n\nI've honestly never had a bad experience with them - I just find it's going to be way easier and cheaper going forward to buy the fare I want from whatever airline is cheapest.

Why is it that this 707 has such tiny engines, yet a current generation engine is much larger in diameter?  I know they use turbofan engines on everything nowadays, but I could have sworn that the older engines had turbofans as well.  Is it just the fact that turbofans are the new engine and they didn\'t have them on older generation planes?  \n  \n**Edit**  \nThe Turbojet came before the Turbofan.  The difference between the two is that turbofans have ""bypass"" air that comes in through the outer cowl and passes over the ""core"" jet engine while some of the air that comes in through the outer cowl goes through the jet engine whereas turbojets don\'t have the bypass.  Air that comes in the front cowl exits the jet engine at the back. As a very loose non-expert example, you have 100% air that comes through the front cowl of a turbofan, only 30% of it actually goes through the jet while the remaining 60% goes out the bypass at the back.  Turbojets are a 100% in, 100% out system.  Turbojets paved the way for turbofans.  Turbofan engines are preferred because they are more fuel efficient than a turbojet, and they are significantly quieter than a turbojet.  \n  \nHere\'s an image:  https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/Images/trbtyp.gif', 'you sir.. just earned an upvote', '[removed]', 'Did you ever do a barrel roll in it?', 'Jstars or awacs?

We all know about the cargo door issue, which was a major one, but after that was fixed, the accident rate was normal comparable to other aircraft of the same generation. What lack of redundancy? If the DC-10 had a redundancy problem it was one shared by all airliners of the time. It wasn\'t a Douglas problem, it was a \'problem\' - and more accurately, just the state - of aircraft design at the time. \n\nYeah, catastrophic mechanical failures tend to have pretty severe effects. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_1862 for a Boeing example quite similar to the above). \n\nIt\'s exactly because of catastrophic failures that nobody thought could really happen causing a/c losses (AA 191, El AL 1862, JAL 123, UA 232, etc) that has led to the current generation of airliners being much better at handling catastrophic failures. \n', 'I also think it is reportedly unstable at slow speeds and prone to rolling - as happened with the cargo DC-10 at Narita. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Express_Flight_80 ', ""It might not have been back in in the 70's and especially not in the DC-10's design stages.

But I'll look it up for you. \nhttp://discussions.flightaware.com/viewtopic.php?p=69627\n\nThere seems to be some debate as to whether the camera was able to operate with the loss of part of the electrical system associated with the loss of the engine. I guess we'll never know. "", ""The plaintiff's are suing on behalf of the deceased for wrongful death. Emotional distress is part of that wrongful death in this particular case. The plaintiff's own emotional distress is immaterial; unless they actually witnessed the crash AND new for certain it was their loved one's plane. Even then it's a tough sell as the distress wasn't intentionally created. Future earning potential is a factor in valuing the loss. Pretty macabre stuff really."", ""There was 1 contributing design flaw, which is why the slats ended up retracting on one side when the hydraulic lines were damaged.  If they had maintained a higher airspeed after the engine loss, it would have remained controllable.  If the slats had stayed extended on both sides, it would have been controllable.  \n\nBut instead, they were flying a speed that was appropriate for full slats, but too slow with slats retracted.  And they weren't configured symmetrically, putting them in a nearly irrecoverable situation.  "", ""I can see what you are trying to get at but Fedex 80 wasn't a DC-10. That aircraft an MD-11. When McDonnell Douglas designed the MD-11, they lengthened the fuselage and shrunk the horizontal stabilizer to reduce drag at high speed. This gave the MD-11 bad handling characteristics at low speed and in crosswind conditions. It had a CG that was farther back, leading to instability and oscillations during landing. Several MD-11's were lost due to this, including Fedex 80. The DC-10 did not have this problem. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_MD-11#Safety_issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_MD-11#Safety_issues)"", ""Not only was that an MD-11, but the roll was due to slamming it down hard enough to break a wing spar.

"", 'It just makes sense to me in this day and age, I can understand not back then.', ""All the passengers on the left side of the plane surely saw the engine fly off. That's no bueno."", ""Yeh, and if IIRC, that was also largely a fault of AA's pilot training. "", 'Very interesting... thanks for this.', ""I heard the longer fuselage of the MD-11 contributed to the pilot's perception of the first impact."", ""Yeah, they were trained to fly V2 in an engine out situation rather than a bit above V2 (I think V2+10 is common now).  However, I'm not sure how much extra speed would have been required to maintain control.  \n\nAnd it's also a question of whether they would have been able to figure out the situation fast enough to shallow their climb to accelerate enough to retract flaps / slats and get the plane symmetrical again before the situation got out of hand.  "", '> ""Okay,"" Richman said, ""but the captain shouldn\'t have lost his power in the first place.""\n\n> ""No, that was a designed-in safety feature,"" Casey said. ""Douglas had designed and built the aircraft to survive those failures. When the left engine tore off, the aircraft deliberately shut down the captain\'s power line, to prevent further shorts in the system. Remember, all aircraft systems are redundant. If one66 fails, the backup kicks in. And it was easy to get the captain\'s instrumentation back again; all the flight engineer had to do was trip a relay, or turn on emergency power. But he didn\'t do either one.""\n\nThat was another issue, they would have figured things HAD they switched to the back up. ', 'V2 + 10 would have been enough to avoid a stall, but not by much (about 4 knots)', ""Good point.  Getting power back to the captain's instruments (or having a stick shaker for the FO as well) would given them a better chance of recovery.  "", ""Why would any crewmember be messing around with the overhead panel at below 400 ft right after takeoff, with an engine failure? Realistically that's just not going to happen. It's entirely unrealistic to expect the Capt or FE to diagnose the electrical problem and solve it in the half-minute they were airborne. ""]"

When AA had their old livery with the metal skins, sans paint (of course except for the stripes), did that save weight on their planes and actually reduce their fuel/overall costs?

This modification was used by Alaska Airlines for many years, and is still employed by Air Inuit, Canadian North, Air North, Nolinor Aviation and First Air in northern Canada.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28', 'Good bot', ""Thank you, ZackProGaming, for voting on WikiTextBot.  \n\nThis bot wants to find the best and worst bots on Reddit.

30,Flight decks - Boeing vs Airbus and the new kids,3,4b2pwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/4b2pwn/flight_decks_boeing_vs_airbus_and_the_new_kids/,26,1458414476.0,"Hi all,

After a discussion over on /r/worldnews following the crash of the 737-8, it came to my attention that Boeing experience more pilot error due to the way their flight decks seem to be built. 

Have a look at the following images:

[787-8 Flight Deck] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Boeing_787-8_N787BA_cockpit.jpg) VS [A350] (http://www.a350xwb.com/fileadmin/templates/a350xwb/assets/img/mood-lighting/cockpit-day.jpg)

Finally, looking at the ""New kids on the block"", namely Embraer, Mitsubishi and Bombardier, all seem to focus on screen space and such.

So in your opinion, do you agree that due to the way that the flight deck is designed, Boeing aircraft are more susceptible to pilot error? What do you think of the newer designs with more screen space?

I would genuinely love to hear all of your opinions!

PS: Who knew it would be that freaking hard to find a picture of the MRJ Flight deck. ","['> it came to my attention that Boeing experience more pilot error due to the way their flight decks seem to be built.\n\nNot true. Anything to back this up?\n\n>  Boeing aircraft are more susceptible to pilot error? \n\nNope', '> So in your opinion, do you agree that due to the way that the flight deck is designed, Boeing aircraft are more susceptible to pilot error? What do you think of the newer designs with more screen space?\n\nNope don\'t agree at all. While I do think the Boeing layout, particularly the 737, can be improved. I don\'t think cockpit layout played a role in any of the major pilot error incidents over the past few years. Especially when it comes to the Air France crash, while pilot error played a major role, Airbus cockpit/flight control philosophy was brought up as a major issue. \n\nThe only ""recent"" pilot error incidents I can think of were really landing issues. Cockpit layout isn\'t necessarily going to play a large factor in those incidents. A 777 cockpit vs. an 330/40 cockpit isn\'t going to help you pay more attention to your airspeed (Asiana! Though I think an Airbus would have protected itself).\n\nOn another note my aircraft currently has auto throttles and I can\'t imagine flying an Airbus where the throttles don\'t move. I override the throttle on my aircraft because they aren\'t quite good enough and taking that away from me would be a huge learning curve. ', 'I love crowded overhead panels, the 737 one is retarded (for stupid reasons), but it looks so nice. Actually the best one for me is the one from the MD80 (well I love everything about that plane), which is even messier.\n\n\nBut I really think that the REAL problem of the 737 is the System Annunciator.   \nhttp://www.b737.org.uk/warningsystems.htm#Warning_Lights  \nIt\'s still exactly the same one from when they invented the two crew cockpit. And it is retarded now.  \nYou have to play Guess Who? to find what\'s wrong when -say- the light ""FUEL"" goes in. Just when you would need to know what\'s exactly wrong as soon as possible. It has 12 lights for ALL the systems of the plane.     \n\nOther planes have many more lights to describe more precisely what the hell is going wrong. More modern ones directly write a message in the screens.\n\nBut they MIGHT have fixed that with the MAX, anyone knows something about it?', 'Airbus is just better.

None are available in Direct law."", ""> I remember them reporting that it was obviously deliberate due to turning the dial.\n\nYes... how does this connect to what you said above? It would also have been obviously deliberate had he turned the AP off and dived into the ground. \n\n> So what's the point of having the plane be nearly capable of flying itself safely, able to get itself out of a stall and keep from flying into things, when a pilot can deliberately do those things, anyway?\n\nErr... planes are not nearly capable of flying themselves, and cannot do those things you specify. \n\n> No? When the pilots make large corrections, it automatically shuts it off for a while.\n\nWhat shuts off for a while? The AP? Yes, an input on the flight controls will disable the AP, if it is engaged. How is this an AP override? This is a manual flight override! \n\n> In addition to the autopilot that can be turned off, but it was my understanding that that button doesn't turn it fully off, but corrections that fight the computer override it.\n\nNo, the input on the yoke disengaged the heading hold function of the AP, while leaving alt hold engaged. When the kid moved the yoke he turned the AP from fully on to half-on, which didn't trigger an alarm, so the crew didn't notice. \n\nBut pressing the AP disconnect would entirely turn the AP off and turn the a/c to fully manual flight. \n\n> But I thought things had changed since then, as well, based on what I read about Germanwings Flight 9525\n\nWhat has changed? It is true that it is generally agreed that, following a few accidents (e.g. Aeroflot 593, Eastern 401), semi-engaged autopilot modes (called CWS, control wheel steering) are prone to misunderstanding and are generally no longer used - an AP is either ON, in which case it controls the flightpath, or OFF, in which case it does not. But fundamentally nothing has changed in terms of control logic. The crew is in command and the AP does not override them. "", ""I don't see why. You just look at the engine indications, which gives way more information than just thrust lever angle."", "">I override the throttle on my aircraft because they (the a/t) aren't quite good enough and taking that away from me would be a huge learning curve. \n\nI was saying that you can override the a/t"", ""Right. But it's easier to see the thrust levers physically move in a direction you're not expecting when you're doing other tasks. It improves situational awareness. Might make you perk up and look at what's going on. Just sitting in the detent does nothing for situational awareness. "", 'Those levers moving are so much easier to see out of your peripheral than say the N2 gauge rolling back.\n\nThen again I like real trim wheels, too. ', ""Ehhh I disagree. They give no indication of what the engine is actually doing, just the AP demand. You shouldn't be relying (to any extent) on TLA to warn you of unusual engine states.\n\nI have no trouble with fixed or moving thrust levers/throttles. Both are different approaches, but fixed does have the benefit of getting your eyes on the E/WD to see what's happening."", 'From my point of view it just adds to situational awareness. It\'s another thing that can warn me to look somewhere else. When we\'re in cruise and we start hitting mountain waves the first thing that normally catches my eye is the throttles moving. \n\nWhich prompts me to look at speed, then maybe engine indications. I think the main factor for me is there\'s a few things I can do better than a computer (at least the computer that programmed in my current A/C). \n\n**Scenario #1: **While I can work in averages the auto throttle (A/T) computer isn\'t programmed to. In gusty conditions if there\'s speed fluctuation of +/-3kts the auto throttles are just going to chase Vrf. I can hold the throttles in a position that\'ll give me an average target speed without having the engine spooling back and forth.\n\n**Scenario #2:** Getting slowed down in cruise, if you slow by more than 10kts the throttles just go to idle. Sometimes the A/T does not try to re-spool until it reaches target speed. Then you have an issue where it takes the engines a few seconds to spool up and. now you\'re slower than target and still slowing. Anytime I get slowed I help the A/T by overriding them a bit just to make a smoother transition without slowing past target. \n\n**Scenario #3:** If you want to get down quick we have a flight idle decent mode. When you push that button on the flight control panel. It usually takes a few seconds before the throttles decide to actually start moving to idle. Here\'s another time where I help the A/T because ATC JUST CLEARED ME FOR A VISUAL APPROACH AND THEY LEFT ME HIGH; WE NEED TO GET DOWN NOW!!!\n\nIn all these scenarios my hands are on the throttles and overriding the A/Ts. I can override without actually turning off the A/T, so in scenario #3 I can ""help"" the throttles back but I still have the protection of auto throttles (eg. Asiana). I don\'t have any experience flying Airbus but can I help the throttle without turning off the A/T? Or do I have to make a choice between just letting the A/T do its thing, and learn to be happy with small deviations. Or if I try to help the A/T and move the throttles from the A/T detent does the A/T turn off.\n\nObviously Airbus aircraft have thousands if not million of hours by now so pilots have there ways of dealing with it. But this is just my view of an outsider looking in with very little experience on something comparable.\n\n']"

They simply aren‚Äôt developed to the point of Western Europe and North America. It bothers me, however, that Boeing is being dragged through the mud, over an issue that a Western European or North American aircrew, would‚Äôve survived, 

Have I lost my mind, or is Boeing in a difficult spot, because they can‚Äôt blame the crew without a backlash?","['We HOPE a well trained aircrew would have survived. We can armchair quarterback all day long, but the truth of the matter is that the ""low time, poorly trained, third world pilots"" performed the emergency procedure Boeing provided to all pilots after the first crash, and they still were unable to control the aircraft.\n\nEdited for civility.', 'TWA... Great.   \n    \nNo, not even our pilots would have likely survived that. The problem with mcas is, that it turns itself on every few seconds, even after deactivating. And additionally, many pilots, even ours, didnt even know about its existence as it was dropped from the handbook.', 'Ethiopian is no second rate airline. Whatever your view of the country, this is a top tier club. Blame is going to boeing for making safety systems optional. And for trying to stretch out the 737 range indefinitely. They should have just designed a new model but chose not to because of cost..', ""If I were a car manufacturer, I wouldn't want to even think of putting any passenger in my car that automatically veered of the road every few minutes. I mean, would you want to buy a car that goes off the road like that every now and then in the first place? Yes, you can control it, but would you want it?\n\nYou can put Lewis Hamilton in and he would probably never crash due to his experience and intense training for these past years or you can put some bloke in and just blame him if he crashed.\n\nIMO, the crews inabilities of handling the situation plays very little role in both of the incidents. \n\nP/s: Lewis might clinch his 6th world title this weekend."", 'Boeing is in a lose lose situation.  They can not do or say anything to defend itself even if there is some truth.

What\'s come out so far makes it pretty clear that at least in the second accident - in which the crew knew exactly what was going on, and crashed anyway because they intentionally strayed from the checklist - the crew definitely was a major factor.\n\nHowever, that does not mean Boeing is blameless. Every accident is a series of links in a chain, and breaking any one of those links would have prevented the accident. The design of MCAS is one of those links. The certification of the system by the FAA without requiring additional crew training is another. And the actions by the crew - especially, but possibly not limited to, the second crew - are a third. There are probably more.\n\nThe media is definitely focusing heavily on Boeing, and I think that\'s mostly because it\'s easier for the media and public to understand the concept of a design flaw than it is to understand checklist usage by a flight crew. It also is a clear systemic issue; pilot training and capability may be a systemic issue too, but it\'s tough to prove that. It\'s relatively easy to look at the MAX and say ""all of those planes have this same problem, so any of them could crash."" You can\'t say that about all MAX pilots, even in the developing world.\n\nI do have a concern that we\'re going to have to read between the lines in the accident reports a bit; these are not going to be NTSB, TSBC or AAIB reports where the agency is wholly independent and answerable to nobody else in the industry. That said, if there are any egregiously incorrect interpretations, watch for those either presently or formerly part of those agencies to come out with their own interpretation of the facts. But my educated guess is still that the blame is going to be spread around, as it probably should be. No idea how the media will report that, though; the media doesn\'t like nuance or a lack of clarity.

The situation was recoverable if the runaway trim is caught fast enough, which clearly isn't always the case.\n\nNow I'm not an expert so there may some way to disable mcas without disabling electronic trim, but it isn't the normal procedure for runway trim and that imo is where Boeing gets the blame, they managed to get it approved by the FAA to not require additional training on those procedures so they could market to airlines with the previous 737s. So even if there was a way, the pilots wouldn't have known, they'd follow the procedure for runway trim, but mcas would get renabled after a few seconds and if they couldn't figure out the problem in time they'd be done (How both crashes happened afaik). I think the fact that it happened twice in a year speaks for itself.\n\nEDIT: One important point is that no accidents have just one cause, it's a combination of errors, the goal is always to eliminate as many possible errors as possible, just because it's recoverable by an alert well trained pilot doesn't mean that's good enough, because sadly that's not always the case."", 'You remember incorrectly.

If so, then isn‚Äôt runaway trim a fairly common training exercise?\n\nNot by disabling trim, but executing whole runaway trim checklist. That was the problem they didn't execute it properly and also failed to manage throttle at all (which resulted in exceeding Vmo), however what crashed the plane in the end was that they reengaged the cutout switches (which is explicitly forbidden in the runaway trim checklist), not to mention while overspeeding.\n\nAnd unfortunately no, runaway trim isn't fairly common training exercise anymore in lots airlines."", ""It's not particularly concerning that we are dependent on automation - automation has saved countless lives, and you only need to look at accident rates over the past 30-40 years to confirm that.\n\nWhat's concerning in *this case* is Boeing's design of the MCAS system. Don't mistake that as an indictment of the entire concept of cockpit automation. The alternative to automation is very high workloads on the imperfect, human pilots, which history has shown results in an even higher accident rate."", "">So even if there was a way, the pilots wouldn't have known, they'd follow the procedure for runway trim, but mcas would get renabled after a few seconds and if they couldn't figure out the problem in time they'd be done (How both crashes happened afaik).

47,Why shouldn't Canadian and Mexican airlines be able to fly domestic itineraries in the United States? Or American airlines fly domestic itineraries in Canada or Mexico? Is there any effort to build true North American open skies?,7,cgkrws,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/cgkrws/why_shouldnt_canadian_and_mexican_airlines_be/,23,1563866907.0,"It seems like airfares would decrease dramatically -- and choice would increase dramatically -- if airlines from the three major North American countries could fly domestic itineraries in all of the countries (i.e. fly Interjet from Chicago to JFK or Air Canada from Oaxaca to Mexico City or Untied from Vancouver to Montreal) -- is there a reason this isn't possible? Is this something that anyone is fighting for? 

I suspect, if this were to happen, North Americans could enjoy truly low airfares, like those which are present in Southeast Asia and Europe.","['First of all canada and mexico have their own regulatory authorities similar to the FAA which certify carriers operating domestically within their borders and which are registered as internationally based in their country.\n\nEurope as part of the EU created EASA which is a centralized regulatory authority for all of europe and most of southeast asia chose to operate in a similar manner thanks to the power and influence of china government and also the relatively small size of their relative governments.\n\nTo allow united or say american to operate flights domestically within Canadian or Mexican airspace then they will need to be certified as a Mexican or Canadian authority for operations.  Meaning technicians being multi certified, getting company operating manuals approved by multiple governing bodies and making revisions have to be approved by mulitple nations.\n\nLogistically it is a nightmare.', 'https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabotage', 'There‚Äôs a few things why this wouldn‚Äôt be good, and it‚Äôs a complex subject - look up the freedoms of aviation. One thing to consider is almost every country has a state carrier, and many are heavily subsidized by their respective countries (especially the Middle Eastern carriers). The US does not have a ‚Äúnational airline‚Äù, and the airlines here would not want foreign carriers to take their business, nor would the FAA want them to.', 'So what you‚Äôre looking for is, at the very least, is the ability for NA airlines to conduct fifth freedom flights or higher flights  in NA. As others have pointed out, it‚Äôs mostly a political consideration, with the added kicker that countries have always been very defensive of their domestic aviation programs. \n\nThe second major issue is that a lot of the major metropolitan areas in the US, Canada, and even Mexico don‚Äôt have enough extra capacity at their airports to allow new entrants into the market (JFK, LGA, EWR, DCA, MEX, Toronto, Vancouver, SFO, and LAX). Domestic airlines would love to add capacity here, but due to gate constraints, slot squatting, or airspace issues they can‚Äôt really add meaningful flights or allow new entrants. \n\nAdditionally, while prices might go down for travelers, this would seriously kneecap employees working conditions and quality of life...particularly for pilots, mechanics, and cabin crew. Airlines would start basing their crews in countries with more lenient duty and rest rules, or the most anti union/anti labor laws and would then send those crews to conduct flights in higher cost areas. It‚Äôd gut the employees pay and benefits, but at the very least you might get a slightly cheaper ticket...maybe...since the cost to provide service does not necessarily correlate to the price airlines would charge (just like the price of a cell phone isn‚Äôt really representative of the cost of the components used to make it). If they can charge a ton to fly people between JFK and LAX they‚Äôll charge it..\n\nWhile not exactly what you wanted, a lot of the smaller Caribbean nations are actually pretty ok with and open to allowing 5th freedom or higher rights into their countries just because it gives them more air service than they‚Äôd be capable of otherwise. \n\nLastly, I don‚Äôt really know what you mean by truly low airfares. The average ticket price between a Spirit or Frontier flight in the US and a Ryan Air or Easy Jet flight in Europe isn‚Äôt that different. Ditto between some NA and EU legacy airlines. If you want to lower ticket prices, I think the lowest hanging fruit would be to redistribute slots at capacity constrained airports, and stop allowing JVs/anti trust immunity with international airlines (Delta and Aeromexico, or West Jet for example). Allowing them to coordinate schedules and pricing when they already control so much of the market just raises prices for consumers. Beyond that I‚Äôd pour money into infrastructure and additional capacity initiatives to also lower the cost of airfare.\n\nEdit: Formatting and grammar.', 'I‚Äôm from Canada and I absolutely agree with you! There are only two airlines in Canada and they are extremely expensive! Domestic flight in Canada are always more expensive than cross border flight. However I think it‚Äôs something about ‚ÄúAirspace‚Äù and  it‚Äôs quiet hard to change.', 'Customs.. although in some Canadian cities you go through US Customs in Canada and arrive at a domestic gate', '> Europe as part of the EU created EASA\n\nRight, so we can do the same thing for North America \n\n>Logistically it is a nightmare.\n\nSeems like Europe and Southeast Asia figured it out -- Canadians/Americans/Mexicans are just as capable!', '> The US does not have a ‚Äúnational airline‚Äù, and the airlines here would not want foreign carriers to take their business, nor would the FAA want them to.\n\nDoes the FAA represent the airlines? Or citizens?', '2 airlines ?', ""Canadian here, the reason flights are more expensive in Canada than the US is because flying isn't subsidised here the way it is in the US. In the States many airports operate at a loss with municipal or state subsidies to keep them open, nav fees are fractions of what they are in Canada, and more.\n\nSo even if US airlines operated in Canada their actual prices wouldn't be much different."", '>Customs.. although in some Canadian cities you go through US Customs in Canada and arrive at a domestic gate\n\nWhy would there be customs issues if a Canadian airline was flying from San Francisco to San Diego? Or a Mexican airline was flying from Houston to Chicago? I hope my question made sense.', "">Right, so we can do the same thing for North America\n\nExcept nobody really wants to do that. Or plans to do, it's pipe dream.\n\nAlso unions would probably have something to say about it as well."", 'Canada is patterned after Europe with mechanic certification being type rated on each aircraft type.  Mexicans are a lot more lenient on their certification standards to where they have more hoops to jump to get qualified to sign for US certified aircraft.  Trust me our government is to disfunctional to figure out how to grandfather technicians to the Canadian and European standard and then redesign the training regime for new technicians.  Conservatives will block it and call is socialist and overly onerous government intrusion.', 'The FAA ‚Äúpromotes and regulates,‚Äù which is an oxymoron. So they promote the interests of all civil aviation in the US, and in turn, for the airlines. In reality, the way things work in the US is interest groups petition the FAA or governmental representatives to get things done in their interests, hoping that regulations (which the FAA is delegated) or laws (Congress) change in their favor. In this example, it would only hurt US airlines, so there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd be on board.', ""FAA doesn't care about this, DOT does."", ""Two airlines that operate coast to coast. There's also a handful of smaller regional carriers."", 'That‚Äôs not at all what keeps most airports open. There isn‚Äôt a big difference at all between how many airports lose money in the US vs Canada. The larger airports on both sides of the border make money, and the government sets aside funds for the smaller airports to use for infrastructure that is mostly paid for via a trust fund, or fuel taxes. \n\nThere is a big difference in Nav/ATC fees between the countries due to Canada‚Äôs being broken out of the government and paid for via user fees, whereas the US uses fuel taxes on jet fuel to achieve the same result. The US ATC system also covers a huge geographical area compared to Canada and has more of an opportunity to charge aircraft that utilize US ATC but don‚Äôt actually land in the US. \n\nOverall on a per aircraft basis, the US ATC system is drastically cheaper than Canada‚Äôs.', 'Thanks for reply! It‚Äôs a good reason especially when one destination is a small city, but I don‚Äôt think it could explain all the price difference. I just did a quick search, from Toronto to Vancouver in this month, AC and WJ both offer $500. From Toronto to Las Vegas, AC has a similar price, but AA is only $380. I‚Äôm not saying AC is bad, but more choices are always result in cheaper price.', ""sorry misread your question.  Was thinking you were asking to be the European model where there are no passport issues and the EU controls the  airlines.  Plus there the distances are small within countries.\n\nI don't think any domestic airline in North America wants to give up there home turf."", 'There shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. They would depart from a domestic gate, and arrive at a domestic gate as well. To me, there seems to be ZERO issues with some sort of open skies agreement.', '> nav fees are fractions of what they are in Canada\n\nThanks for expanding on this point.', 'Different regulations and zero political will to unify them for one of the issues.', 'Yeah, it would be great for consumers - would substantially lower prices.

When I'm on a commercial flight I love sitting near the wing so that I can see the ailerons, flaps and spoilers working. I like to try and keep track of what stage of the flight we're in by the control surface movements and sounds I can hear like the engines throttling up/down and the landing gear deploying/retracting. 

I was flying to California to go house hunting a couple weeks back (moving there from Canada) when I had an idea. A bunch of my friends are into amateur radio and told me about RTL-SDR, a little software defined radio module originally meant to be a digital TV tuner. It's a receive only radio that looks like a USB storage drive with an SMA connector for an antenna, and if you have the right USB cable you can plug it into an Android phone. There are apps that will let you use it to tune all kinds of frequencies, including aviation radio and ADSB. 

I have one on the way and was thinking it would be awesome to bring it along look up the ground, tower and enroute frequencies for my flight back down there so I could keep myself entertained (I tend to fly el-cheapo airlines like American who don't have the seat-back displays that will give you at least the ADSB data). 

Has/does anybody else here do this? And if so, what has your experience been getting through airport security with the device/antenna? As I said the device looks like a USB drive and I'm considering using just a length of wire I can coil/bundle with my headphones cables as an antenna instead of the somewhat more conspicuous telescopic antenna that comes with it. 

I also plan the leave the radio/antenna in my laptop bag and only have the USB cable running out to my phone, and obviously I wouldn't tell anybody else on the plane what I'm doing.

I have been on so many planes with turbulence, abrupt droppings, and crazy stuff but this one... this one was scary. My neighbor had to hold hands with me.

And it happened several times. It was cloudy so you couldn‚Äôt see when we were going to land to mentally prepare. It was just sharp deep drops. Can‚Äôt explain it. But trust me this wasn‚Äôt normal. What could have happened?

I went on a flight tracking site and took some screenshots of my flight, and similar flights (same landing destination) to compare.

', 'Wind shear.', 'Micros burst maybe but that a stretch. We‚Äôre there any storms nearby?', 'My $0.02\n\nThe shaded areas in your pictures are precipitation. Generally, depictions of rain goes from green to yellow to red (and then magenta in some cases) in increasing order of intensity. Your flight went through a fair bit of green (light) and some yellow (moderate) and I believe there is some red (heavy) in the area. \n\nAreas of rain, even light, typically equates to a somewhat bumpy ride. If it is flat stratus clouds with rain you could get a fairly smooth flight through, but what shows on your path seems more like cumulus-type clouds (aka white puffy clouds in layman‚Äôs terms) and those tend to give bumps. \n\nIt‚Äôs looks like your flight made a turn in a hold, or abandoned an approach - the ‚Äúracetrack‚Äù pattern seen. That could mean lots of things, but it may be that the weather deteriorated during the flight arrival and the crew elected to delay the approach to allow improvement. The vertical scale shown looks like they climbed back up for a time, which adds credence to this theory. The range of the vertical scale is pretty large (up to 40,000‚Äô) so it‚Äôs hard to discern much from it and I don‚Äôt think you can look at it for any indication of what you experienced. \n\nI will say that turbulence doesn‚Äôt displace an aircraft by hundreds of feet (other than mountain wave, but that tends to take place over a longer time and can be less scary as a result)  What you felt was more likely feet or maybe tens of feet, but I can understand how it feels like far more. \n\nIt looks like you were on an Airbus. Without triggering an Airbus/Boeing fight, I will say this (I‚Äôve got a few thousand hours on the type): They have excellent radar (so does Boeing, for that matter) that the crew uses to avoid rain/weather, and the flight control laws do an excellent job of handling turbulence and wind shear during the approach and landing.\n\nTLDR: it looks like you arrived during some stormy weather. Your crew avoided the worst weather and possibly delayed their approach to allow conditions to improve, but your flight still encountered some turbulence that was understandably disconcerting. ', 'I always get something like this during flights :(', 'Yeah Im going with turbulence/windshear.  Microburts/squall lines/gust fronts are usually MUCH more violent or produce a much more sustained downward (and upward) forces.  Remember you can get that weightless falling feeling from just a rapid 50foot change in altitude.  In the realm of aircraft operating in 1000s of feet and hundreds of mph, 50ft is nothing, it just feels like a lot.', ""How long did it seem to be dropping steeply? Are we talking like 10 seconds, 1 minute, etc?\n\nIf you look at the track log, you will see a column for Rate, which tells you the Vertical Rate in ft/min. During descent, it did not exceed -2950 ft/min.\nhttps://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL449/history/20190325/0607Z/KLAX/KIND/tracklog\n\nFor comparison, the previous day's flight reached -2900 ft/min.\nhttps://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL449/history/20190324/0607Z/KLAX/KIND/tracklog\n\nSo nothing unusual about the overall descent rate. Now, the granularity of the data is only about once per minute, so it won't show any sudden drops that only last a few seconds. So like others said, I think it was turbulence."", 'The only thing that looks slightly out of the ordinary to me is that the data shows a descent to 3,800 feet followed by an ascent to 5,000 feet before the descent resumes again. In general, there\'s no point in clearing a flight to descend to an altitude and then asking them to ascend again. But that also could be due to any number of things, from avoiding a rough patch of air (maybe there was a PIREP of turbulence through that area) to changing to a different runway or approach. It doesn\'t really explain what you say you felt anyway.\n\nI\'m also going to go with wind shear as the answer. Usually when you feel that sensation of coming out of your seat, the plane is actually \\*increasing\\* in altitude, believe it or not. You\'re at the top of a ""hill"" - the airplane has increased altitude by 20-30 feet due to changing winds - and the pilots or autopilot are pushing it back down to assigned altitude.\n\nWind shear can go in any direction - it\'s not just from a headwind to a tailwind. It also often comes with turbulence, so you might feel a jolt at the same time as feeling like you\'re either coming out of or being pressed down into your seat.', 'Ok! I definitely feel better now. Thanks for your response!', 'nope, no storms.', 'Thanks so much for your response. There were definitely lots of white puffy clouds.\n\nI wish the pilot could have explained things to us as they happened (eg. due to terrible weather we have to delay landing etc).  But regardless, I feel much better now.  Thanks.', 'Yeah maybe I exaggerated about the drop being hundreds of feet. It sure felt like it though. Thanks for your response!', 'More like 5 seconds, then stabilized and then dropped again for another 5 seconds. So scary! But now I know it was most likely due to turbulence. Thanks for your response!', ""oh wow didn't know that. That feeling could have been from the ascent then.  Thanks for your response!"", 'I dug into the ATC archives on LiveATC and it sounds like your flight had a missed approach. \n\nThe tower recording [KIND Tower](http://archive-server.liveatc.net/kind/KIND-Twr-Mar-25-2019-0930Z.mp3) has them initiating the missed approach at about the 11:59 point. \n\nThe departure controller recording [KIND Departure](http://archive-server.liveatc.net/kind/KIND-App-Dep-Mar-25-2019-0930Z.mp3) has them checking back in at the 13:42 mark. \n\nIn their words, they had ‚Äúan issue with the automation on short final‚Äù\n\nThat could mean many things and I wouldn‚Äôt want to speculate. The simplest reality I can say is that we are all taught that when things aren‚Äôt going quite right the best, safest, course of action is to go around (abandon the approach), climb back up and get things sorted out before starting another approach. \n\nI‚Äôll add: missed approaches (aka go-arounds) are a fairly common occurrences, but they can be pretty startling in the passenger cabin. In a few seconds you go from a fairly quiet, steady descent to a very quick increase in engine noise and the plane pitching up abruptly as it climbs away. Probably all the more so at 5:30am when you go from half-asleep to wide-awake nearly instantly. ', 'Yeah.  It also looks like they may have started the descent normal, had to level out (probably traffic/atc) then did a ‚Äúchop and drop‚Äù to get back down.  Maybe blew a little too low through the altitude then hopped back up slightly to get back on profile.  At least that would explain the humps.  ', ""wow that's great information!

They have had an emphasis on safety and high standards op for a very long time.  Their bankruptcy in the early 2000's actually put them way ahead in the game.

I'd say its due more to the culture Anderson has promoted since he came to Delta. He's really turned things around a complete 180.\n  \nThat being said, as the article states, AA is already over 99% completion rate as of Q3, so they're very close. I am sure they could increase their dispatch reliability with more preventative maintanence, but in the long run, I think AA's biggest problems will come from the weather they get at DFW (snow/ice in the winters, for which they are ill equipped for, and nasty thunderstorms in the Spring for which not much can be done). Also, ORD can be quite messy during snow storms (I'd say MSP and DTW have better facilities, and have less delays in general).\n  \nEither way, glad to see airlines in the US investing in their product and pushing the envelope. "", 'Yes. Very rare we cancel', ""As in they will delay a flight for as long as they need to but they will not cancel it. Whereas if American has a delay that gets long enough they'll just cancel. You're a fool if\nyou think delta cuts corners in safety to increase completion rate"", 'AA is also the opposite of proactive about weather.\n\nThis spring I was supposed to fly SJC-DFW-MCI on AA on a Sunday; on Saturday there were storms in DFW and of course something like half the flights cancelled... including the last DFW-SJC of the night, which was supposed to provide an aircraft to overnight at SJC and operate the first flight back the following day.\n\nBut AA continued to pretend that flight was going to be fine, up until the very last moment when finally it cancelled. I was refused proactive rebooking through PHX (despite space available on the flights) because SJC-DFW was still ""on time"" up until it cancelled. Ended up spending an extra night in San Jose before getting home.\n\nAnd then there was the MCI-ORD that was delayed two hours for weather at ORD, but the AA staff insisted my connection would be fine -- ORD was shut down, so all flights were delayed. Except it turned out my connecting flight *was* on time, and I only found that out after my connection time had dwindled down to twelve minutes. Got rebooked onto a different itinerary through ORD, and then five minutes later AA cancelled my original flight\n\nAnd then there was the time I boarded an MSP-DFW flight only to find, after we\'d pushed back from the gate, that DFW was in a ground stop estimated to last two and a half hours. AA staff knew this, but boarded the flight and pushed back anyway, then had the plane sit on the tarmac until DFW cleared. I ended up spending the night in Dallas and paying for a Southwest flight out of DAL just to get home from that one, since AA still wasn\'t up and running again after the previous day\'s storms, but WN was.\n\nAnd then there was the time I was doing LHR-PHL-ORD-MCI, boarded the PHL-ORD, and they announced just before closing the boarding door that, by the way, ORD is in ground stop for at least 90 minutes. Since that was already going to misconnect me, I pulled up my phone and saw my connection out of ORD had already cancelled, along with the later one, and practically *sprinted* off the plane to try to grab the last PHL-MCI of the night. Ended up spending the night at PHL on that one, though it was better than getting stuck in the mess of ORD on a weather day.\n\nAnd all of these happened in a single year.\n\nSo at the start of October I signed up for a Delta status match. 20,000 miles in 60 days, and now I\'ve got Platinum status with them and, do you know, they haven\'t yet stranded me anywhere overnight!', 'Definitely Anderson, but when Delta came out of bankruptcy they did not take it lightly.

I don't need to tell you about PHL and the shit show it can be. To get the amount of Non-stops that Delta has from DTW and keep my status.... \n\nI just wish that the prices were more in line with each other."", ""I've had my fair share of issues with Delta in the past few months alone (including staying overnight in Atlanta), but I agree that its still a better situation than AA. The saving grace (IMO) is that Delta is very proactive and you're able to rebook yourself on the mobile app as soon as the flight is delayed (even if its only 5 minutes). And each time you check, it shows you the best options that become available, so its very easy to hop between flights. So much better than having to wait in line for hours on end just to get yourself rebooked on something that will actually work, only to find out that everything is already gone.\n  \nI have faith in AA though once things start to settle post merger. They'll still have issues at DFW and ORD but with the number of hubs they have, hopefully they'll be able to reroute passengers efficiently during IROPS. But they'll really need to come up with a way to let you rebook yourself without needing to talk to an agent. With that being said, now I'm a bit nervous for my 45 min connection at DFW that's coming up soon."", ""My little brother was stranded overnight in ATL by Delta... \n\nBut he was flying standby for free so he can't really complain.

Plus if AA really scaled back PHX they\'d be ceding the airport -- and a lot of western-US connections -- to WN, which has a major presence there, and I don\'t think they want to do that.\n\nThe most likely thing is that LAX stays a major Pacific/international gateway for AA, but PHX continues to fill in as a domestic connecting hub, and maybe the Hawaii flying goes seasonal instead of year-round.\n\nSimilar logic suggests PHL is going to stay hubbed for the foreseeable future; the only place AA can move capacity without forcing people well out of their way is JFK, and adding a bunch of flights through JFK is like trying to add a bunch to LAX: the airport just can\'t handle it.\n\nAlso, the O&D/yield chase/""mainline is only for premium routes, RJ farms for everyone else"" approach is what got Jeffy in hot water at UA.

US used to sell heavily to LA-based fliers who were willing to change planes in PHX for a cheaper flight east, and if that continues to be viable, then PHX will retain a lot of its stature. But it won't remain what it was for America West and US Airways. The New American simply has too much capacity and Phoenix doesn't bring home the bacon like all their other hubs do."", ""I don't understand why the online aviation community is so sure of themselves and wants AA's PHX hub to fail.

We have just over 10,000. I know many people that have been relocated to mecAA and I'd hate to see more forced out or lose their jobs completely. "", ""I think at this point we have to look at DL for how to run a successful large airline in the US. And there's a reason why DL keeps that hub at SLC; AA's going to be in a similar position with PHX. It'll stay a domestic connecting hub to take pressure off the big international gateways, especially since it has good weather compared to DFW and ORD. Wouldn't be surprised to see some routes through PHX lose frequency, maybe a couple upgauge from large CRJ to A319 in the process (since the flip side of PHX's weather is it can be rough on the RJs in the summer), but I don't think it's going to be de-hubbed and I don't think they'll cut too drastically since WN would love to take over there. At PIT they weren't moving far away and didn't have a competitor happy to hoover up their business."", 'American, like Delta, will probably institute a formal ""tiered hub"" system. Delta has Atlanta, Detroit, and Minneapolis, but also secondary hubs at Seattle, SLC, and JFK. Right now, American\'s hubs are all equal on paper (probably for political/union reasons), but it\'s obvious who the real breadwinners are, and we may see a more concrete acknowledgement of that. After all, Delta doesn\'t treat SLC the same way they treat ATL and DTW. But Delta is an honest airline.']"

I think most would catagorize this example as moderate turbulence. What most people experience is light turbulence, which occurs much more often, but is still something many fliers have never experienced.\n\nBut even experiencing light turbulence one time is enough to make people understand why it is a good idea to keep their seat belt fastened whenever possible.', ""- Why you always fasten your seatbelts when you're in your seat\n\n- If people are injured, flights are usually diverted, always better safe than sorry in the eyes of the airline\n\n- It doesn't actually look that bad on the video."", ""I was on a 747 from Sydney to Tahiti.

We continued on to Tahiti, though to be honest, our destination may have been the closest option. Other than the drop, the scariest part was after landing in Papeete. We taxied to the part of the runway farthest from the terminal and cleared the stalled engine, which was loud, shaky, and culminated in a huge bang. My description is based on what the crew told us, so I'm curious if anyone can better explain what happened."", ""I've been through some pretty heavy turbulence in my time. \nCouple of notes to think about\n1) The human body can take it just fine, and the aircraft can take more force than a human can really survive, so don't worry about the aircraft\n2) Since it's not something that can easily be detected, it's hard to know when you'll hit it (for the most part) and just as hard to know when you'll get out of it\n3) there are some areas of the world have high traffic and are known to have high trubulence on a regular basis. Japan is a really bad one, aircraft flying in the area on their way to the North America coast will often encounter lots of turbulence, as I have a couple of times. \n4) If the flight attendants look calm, don't worry, they have most likely been through it many times and they know it's not a big issue. \n\nThat being said, pilots won't often divert unless this has caused an injury because someone wasn't wearing their seatbelt, or everyone got sick, or hysterical passengers. They need to decide what's best for the safety of the flight, and flying 10 more hours with a bunch of hysterical crazies in the back crying won't make anyone comfortable. \n\nIn the end the most important thing to do is keep your seatbelt on when seated.

Many on the bottom found there was no job to move up to and no attrition to hope for. Lot's to be bitter about.\n\nThat said....\n\nIf you can get over the hurdle of qualifying for a job, the career prospects now are great. Retirements are building to a peak in the early to mid 2020s. Mergers have probably shaken out and we're left with a few solid major airlines that anchor major alliances. A pilot shortage means pilot unions are successfully reclaiming pay and work rules they lost in bankruptcy. A career at a regional is shorter now and better paying than it's ever been, sometimes with signing bonuses that take the famed miserable first-year pay up in to actual rent-paying territory. Seniority movement at the majors is so fast that a new hire today might look at their first command (E190/B717) in the 5 year time-frame, and a wide-body within 15. That's just crazy, when fairly recently it took 15 years seniority just to have a job, everyone else having been laid off. \n\nThe next few years are going to be fascinating, with retirements of about 4000/yr not at all offset by new ATPs numbering closer to half that. JetBlue is starting an ab initio program, and my own crystal ball says the future industry will be decided by how new money gets injected in to the flight training market. If you want to be an airline pilot someone might just pay you to do it. Could be a Faustian bargain though, if in doing so you lose leverage to demand high pay. Who knows, just yet. \n\nHow you manage to pay for your education and flight training might have a lot of influence in how you enjoy your career. If it takes you five years post college to get your hours, and five more years at a regional, you'll be poor, in debt, and a slave to a job schedule at exactly the time you'd prefer to be starting a family and settling down. That embitters a lot of people. If you can keep the costs down and the flight time comes a little quicker, you might quite enjoy a bit of travel adventure and have a fourth stripe or a job at a major."", 'Probably should have marked thie serious, because it is. ', ""Do your own research and draw your own conclusions, however mine basically lead me to that conclusion as well. Flying commercially seems only worth while about the last 10-15 years before retirement. Everything else is a shit show of high debt and laughable wages until you slog enough time that a legacy will actually read your resume'.\n\nFly for fun all you want, but I think few would recommend a career in it. Again, that was simply my conclusion. Your altitude may vary."", ""Do you really want to base your future on the comments of one unhappy, disgruntled airline employee? If what he says is true, then there wouldn't be many airlines in operation. \n\nDo what you feel is best for you. Yes, airline jobs can be crappy, but there are those who really enjoy the work. It's like that with any career. "", 'You can find plenty of people like that in every career path.  Working is, well, work.', ""I come from the airline industry and feel like I should share this. I'll try and make this as simple as possible.\n\n* Yes, these are hard times. No one can deny this fact. On the other hand there is an incrasing demand for pilots, we are using more and more airplanes. However there are many pilots looking for jobs as well, so it is hard getting jobs in many countries. If you truly love flying and want a job i suggest looking to other countries and even continents where you are more likely to get a job and get flying hours.\n\n* What about payment? This will vary from where you are and who you work for. Do not expect huge salaries luxary and much free time. It will probably never be like that, but at least of what I have seen, commercial pilots still get a decent pay. Some companies pay good, some pay bad. \n\n* There are also pilot jobs for many types of companies; oil companies, medicinal services etc.. There are MANY options, you dont have to work for a major airline like Delta og Emerates. Also thing about where you are going to fly. Some companies need you to fly long haul, some do city hopping. If you fly for a cargo company in congo you will land and dirt roads with turn in the middle of the jungle, if you fly for Wideroe in Norway your gonna fly in challenging wather, terrain and very short runways. There are a lot of variations that so many people never consider.\n\n* Do what you want to do. One thing is for certain...you will find people talking nagativly about anything and everything. Dont listen to them, see oppertunities not limitations. When you WANT to fly but you DONT because getting a job will be hard, you need to change your mind set. Take a challange, take baby steps and eventually you're flying and youre doing what you love.\n\nMuch of what you hear is just people who have given up or are were expecting too much too soon or are incapable of adapting todays and tomorrows standards and expectations. Dont listen to people who spread this kind of negativity."", ""Very sorry you had this experience.  Personally, I don't think there has been a better time in the last 25 years for an airline career.  All the majors are very top heavy with pilots who have 10yrs or less til retirement.  Although the numbers of people who are hired today isn't huge, it is consistent and constant,  and that will only increase as time goes on.  "", ""The reason they called it the golden age is because it was. When airlines are making only a few dollars profit per seat, they need to fight for every dollar. Unfortunately flying as a profession is no longer the grand adventure it used to be, now it seems it's just another job where employees struggle to scrape by. "", ""Speaking from a 135 cargo operation, there are plenty of flying jobs available and it's not as dire as everyone says.  Once you get your 1200 hours there are jobs all over.  Shit, you can make 60k flying a Navajo for 2 hours a day with freight.  Most people I know have no desire to fly airlines and instead fly charter, cargo, or air ambulance."", ""There are a lot of really bad attitudes in the airlines. Lots of old folks who have become very bitter and spiteful (not that it isn't justified for many), but you can't let them decided your career path for you."", ""I've met many pilots in an attempt to decide if I should pursue that path. The majority of them are sour about their career, more so than other industries I've been exposed to.\n\nI can't say why they're so sour, but it appears that to succeed (be happy) as a pilot, you must LIVE for the job.\n\nOn another note, I'm very curious to see how aviation will adapt and evolve to the possibility fossil fuels being phased out. *If* that happens in our lifetime."", ""I'll give you my perspective as a current regional airline pilot. I love my job.  I can't imagine doing anything else. Yes, I do want to move to a major carrier and fly bigger metal, but if not, it's not the end of the world.   As far as pay goes, yeah, it sucks for a while but you get creative and make it past that.  \n\nLet's talk about quality of life though.  I know my schedule a month ahead of time.  I have only talked to a person in scheduling twice in the last 6 months, once to get a hotel when I timed out, and once to drop a turn from my schedule.  I haven't talked to my chief pilots in almost a year.  Pretty much I show up, operate my flights safely, and go home.  Compare that to a charter flying buddy of mine that gets a call from scheduling at least once a day including days off trying to change his schedule.  He is constanly having days off changed on him. At times he has worked stretches of 30 days in a row.  \n\nMy point is every job in this industry has its pros and cons.  While you do come across bitter airline pilots,  there is a larger percentage that just like to hang out, talk a little shit to each other and have a fun 4 days of work.  Get out and talk to as many pilots in as many fields as you can.  Find a job that fits the kind of lifestyle you want to have, and go for it.  In the end pilots are pilots. It's a unique group of people, and yes we talk shit about each others paths like they are all sub par.  At the same time though,  I haven't met a pilot yet who wasn't willing to give help to someone looking for assistance.  "", ""Great comment, and I think the most important point here is about how you pay for your training.  If you drive yourself into six figure debt, it's an absolute miserable slog.  If you manage to fund your own training (not easy but not impossible) and are in no debt, or at least very minimal debt, then the first year regional pay still pays rent, food, and I'm even able to have a little fun on occasion."", ""Of course not. Otherwise he wouldn't be posting here looking to pick his head up."", 'We scrape by in style? ']"

87,"American Airlines Flight 587 taxiing at JFK on November 12, 2001. A few minutes after taking off, the vertical stabilizer of this airframe would come apart (due to excessive rudder inputs by the FO) and crash into Queens, NY. All 260 people onboard, and five on the ground, were killed. Eerie.",52,aoqh1k,https://i.redd.it/ea3ufuxo4if21.jpg,12,1549729042.0,,"['I was in 7th grade when it happened.  Being a young aviation enthusiast, and with 9/11 only two months prior, it was a sad time for the airline industry.  I watched a documentary on AA 587 a few years ago and recall the conclusion that had the pilots simply done nothing--no control inputs in response to the wake turbulence they were flying through--the aircraft would have been just fine.  Makes it all the more sad.  At least we learned from it.', 'In my opinion, these guys did nothing wrong, though could be accused of being a bit ""ham-footed"". They were at 250 kts, and Maneuvering Speed was about 270. Most pilots (at that time) thought full control inputs at that speed would not make the airplane come apart. I was an airline pilot at the time and I definitely thought it was safe to do (though I could not imagine needing or wanting to do it). From the NTSB Safety Recommendation:\n\nFrom an engineering and design perspective, maneuvering speed is the maximum speed at which, from an initial 1 G flight condition, the airplane will be capable of sustaining an abrupt, full control input limited only by the stops or by maximum pilot effort. In designing airplanes to withstand these flight conditions, engineers consider each axis (pitch, roll, and yaw) individually and assume that, after a single full control input is made, the airplane is returned to stabilized flight conditions. \n\nFull inputs in more than one axis at the same time and multiple inputs in one axis are not considered in designing for these flight conditions. The American Airlines managing director of flight operations technical told the Safety Board, during a post-accident interview, that most American Airlines pilots believed that the airplane would be protected from structural damage if alternating full rudder pedal inputs were made at an airspeed below maneuvering speed. The American Airlines A300 fleet standards manager confirmed this belief during public hearing testimony at the Board‚Äôs public hearing for this accident. The Board notes that the American Airlines A300 Operating Manual contained only one reference to design maneuvering speed, which indicated that it was the turbulence penetration speed **(270 knots)**. However, as evidenced by flight 587, cyclic rudder pedal inputs, even when made at airspeeds below maneuvering speed, can result in catastrophic structural damage. \n\nExisting regulations and guidance pertaining to maneuvering speed may have contributed to the misunderstanding regarding the degree of structural protection provided by operating below maneuvering speed. Title 14 CFR 25.1583, ‚ÄúOperating Limitations,‚Äù lists maneuvering speed among the airspeed limitations that must be furnished to the pilots of transport-category airplanes and states that, along with maneuvering speed, pilots must also be furnished ‚Äúwith a statement that full application of rudder and aileron controls, as well as maneuvers that involve angles of attack near the stall, should be confined to speeds below this value.‚Äù Although it is true that full control inputs should be confined to airspeeds below maneuvering speed, the statement in Section 25.1583 could also be read to incorrectly imply that an airplane could withstand any such inputs so long as they were made below maneuvering speed. The explanation of design maneuvering speed in AC 61-23C, ‚ÄúPilot‚Äôs Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,‚Äù may be even more misleading, stating that, ‚Äúany combination of flight control usage, including full deflection of the controls, or gust loads created by turbulence should not create an excessive air load if the airplane is operated below maneuvering speed.‚Äù This statement strongly‚Äîand incorrectly‚Äî suggests that, if multiple control inputs were made below maneuvering speed, the airplane would be protected against structural damage. \n\nThe Safety Board has no reason to believe that the misunderstanding about maneuvering speed is limited to A300-600 pilots. As a result, the Safety Board concludes that there is a widespread misunderstanding among pilots about the degree of structural protection that exists when full or abrupt flight control inputs are made at airspeeds below the maneuvering speed. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the FAA should amend all relevant regulatory and advisory materials to clarify that operating at or below maneuvering speed does not provide structural protection against multiple full control inputs in one axis or full control inputs in more than one axis at the same time.  ', 'Fifteen years after this accident an AD was issued to install a light on the glare shield that says ‚ÄúSTOP RUDDER‚Äù if the systems senses rapid opposing rudder input. ', 'Still sounds sketchy to me...""he used the control too much, so the thing fell off"". I\'d prefer my airliners to be indestructible by input alone, thank you.', 'It was known after the incident that the A300-600 was sensitive to rudder inputs at the time and that it may not have been completely the First Officer‚Äôs fault. The tail took **iirc** 7 strong inputs after dealing with wake turbulence from a 747. The tail was estimated to have taken 80-95% more force than it‚Äôs physical limitations. Not a good day or year for aviation in New York.', ""Does anyone know why the FO made the rudder inputs? In the mayday episode they said it was to counteract turbulence which doesn't make sense to me. "", '[deleted]', 'This is super interesting, I didn‚Äôt realize they were well below Va when this happened.  \n\nI was always taught the same information about Va, and I trained well after 2001.  I wonder how many other aircraft don‚Äôt meet this standard of ‚Äúbelow Va, one control input full deflection‚Äù before structural damage occurs.', 'It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs happened before, the older model B-52s had a few crash when their vertical stabilizer came apart. Even the tech manual for the B-47 warned against excessive inputs. Aircraft fly in a specific way, so long as you stay in that envelope you‚Äôre generally fine.  Besides, everything from theater B-52 crash to the Alaska C-17 crash we‚Äôre all the result of input failures by the aircrew.', 'Yeah most airplanes have a maneuvering speed above which large control inputs can cause structural damage.', ""Do you know anything about this technique for wake turbulence? I'm curious to know more but can't fins much."", 'Not quite.  Go read the NTSB findings for clarification.', 'It‚Äôs to keep the aircraft on proper course and upright.

Because I'm fairly certain it's a Copa 737-800 or -900 (or maybe United). First, the aircraft has Scimitars. They aren't very clear in the edited image but are obvious in the original. American 737s don't have scimitars- the only American 737s with non-standard blended winglets are the MAXs, and the winglets shown differ from the new MAX winglets (both upper and lower portions of the MAX winglets take up the entire width of the wing, whereas the lower winglet of the Scimitars is much thinner). You can tell this isn't a MAX due to the shape and size of the engines and the tail.\n\nSecond, the plane's paint doesn't look like American at all, either the old or new livery. Again referencing the original image, you can tell that there's a thin, low cheatline that goes the length of the aircraft and is low enough to intersect the tail skid (the lowest part of the old AA livery's cheatline stopped far above the tail skid, and the cheatline itself was much thicker). Also, you can make out the characteristic United/Copa/Continental silver/polished/unpainted strips at the lowest part of the belly with grey/beige between these shiny areas and the thin cheat line. Finally, the tail is barely visible but the markings look like the stripes of the United/Continental or Copa Globe. The multiple similarly sized bold bright lines and the way they curve say 'Copa' to me, but it could just be the angle and lighting making it unclear. \n\nI'm not trying to call you out or anything and I think this is an awesome shot!

I'm not really sure how specific I should get with naming companies or particular locations, so I'll leave it at that. After interviewing, I've also come up with an offer on that end as well. I realize that this presents a tremendous opportunity working for an actual engineering company with a much broader scope than the airline, but on a different side of the commercial aviation operation. So this begs the question... Operator or OEM? Do any of you have jobs in either field? If you were in my position now, just graduated, no little ones, a steady gf who I've discussed both possibilities with (though she leans towards the airline for obvious reasons)... what would you do and why? I'd be happy to receive input from anyone, not just those who have jobs in the field. 

I couldn't be more excited about the ""good problem"" I have; I know that I'll be happy and successful in either position. I've had a passion for planes since I was a little kid. Having an international background, one of my favorite things to do was to go with my parents to pick up family at the airport and see all the massive jets, just thinking to myself ""how the hell do those things fly??"" Then having worked on the ramp for a while, studied engineering, worked for the very airline we'd used for forever, finished my studies, and now having the chance to work in the area I'm most passionate about... I have to say I'm very grateful for the position I find myself in. However, it's not an easy decision by any means, and I'd appreciate your input reddit! You guys (and gals) are awesome and I thank you in advance. ","['Aerospace structural design & stress engineer here: \n\nBeing young, I would recommend the one gives you the most opportunity for advancement, which, in my opionion, is the OEM. My logic is this:\n\n1) OEM jobs don\'t come up very often, so take it while you can. You may never have this opportunity again.\n\n2) OEM jobs are (at least in the structural world) very well respected, so even if you do it for a year or two and decide it\'s not for you, it would probably be very easy to get a job with an operator again.\n\n3) being young in your career, its very beneficial to get as much experience as you can. Already working for an operator is good and all, but you\'ve already got that under your belt. Working for an OEM will be almost a completely new experience.\n\n4) a few years down the road if/when you\'re looking for a new job,  you look a lot more marketable if you\'ve got experience at two good employers rather than one. Sometimes those responsible for hiring may get the impression that you\'re not ambitious if you\'ve just stuck it out at the same job for a long time. It looks really good on a resume when you can show upward progression.\n\n5) going with the OEM gets you as ""deep"" into the engineering as possible. It sounds like you\'re really interested in what you\'re doing and there is literally nowhere else in the world where you can learn more about those engines than with the OEM. I work for a mid-sized MRO-type facility that does engineering of repairs & modifications and it can be pretty discouraging to come to the conclusion ""we can\'t do this because we don\'t have the design data"" or ""we can\'t do this because we can\'t afford the software."" (not a knock on my company, they\'re great, but the nature of the business is the OEMs guard their design data and are usually the only ones who can afford the nice software!)\n\n\nIf you\'re still on the fence, you can always try negotiating your offer. Maybe one of them will offer you some extra vacation days, relocation expenses, or a couple thousand more per year to tip the scales in their favor.\n\n\nGood luck with the decision, and I\'m very envious of you! I\'ve always liked engines more than structures! ', ""Go with the manufacturer. You'll have better pay, better benefits, more security, probably more ability to transfer around the world, etc. Flight benefits are nice but they're not everything.

You become a number, and the dedication and overtime goes unnoticed. \n\nIt really comes down to your values and what you look for in a career. If you wish to be appreciated, stick with an operator. With a manufacturer, you'll be a number. When it comes time for layoffs at a manufacturer, your hard work and dedication will go unnoticed. You become a cost that needs to be eliminated. An operator on the other hand, will consider how much you have given to the company. \n\nEDIT:\nI also believe that a manufacturer will typically have you doing the same job over and over, whereas at an operator you will be exposed to a more diverse set of problems. That is the way it has played out in my career anyway. At the MFR, I was a sheet metal and landing gear tech. I didn't get much experience outside of that. At various operators, I got many more opportunities, the biggest one being in depth avionics work. \n\nWorking for the manufacturer I did, I have to say I noticed the opposite of u/thisguy60 in regards to job openings.

I'm curious how the OEM technician job would relate to the field service engineer type of job that I have the opportunity for. I get the feel, from talking to several different people, that the OEM job will present various opportunities for future growth and movement within the company, as opposed to the airline engineer job which, for the foreseeable future, will remain at the current HQ. Also, the particular OEM job is one of two representative positions working *alongside* the airline in a product support/field service sort of role; so, in a sense, I'm getting both the airline *and* the OEM experience simultaneously. \nI understand what you're saying about the nature of the technician job, I'm just not sure that it translates directly to the type of opportunity being discussed.

Is this a good path?


 I understand there are courses out there specifically for becoming a pilot but my maths are very poor and I can't reach the required level to get into those courses. I would also be open to the military route, and I am eligible for both the Canadian and American forces, but I'm pretty sure my math skills are too poor for that too. 

I have done a lot of research on all this but I'm still left with a lot of questions, so please don't tell me to ""look on google"" or ""check the sidebar"" because I already have, I just need some opinions on my own personal situation.

Guys who were better mechanics but didn\'t mind flying usually fell into a corporate flying scenario, rather than going to the airlines. \n\nIf you want to go to the airlines, you\'d better have a deep love of flying. The sacrifices involved - the cost, crazy schedules, never having a secure job - pretty much demand it. Even with the impending wave of retirements coming, there\'s never going to be a shortage at the major airlines, but there will be at the regionals. \n\nAlso, keep in mind you don\'t have to go to one of the top-tier universities or flight training schools to get your ratings.

NOTES: 

1). All info up to date as of Week 7 2016 and as accurate as I can make it. All errors are mine. 

2). Teams coming off long homestands or homestand/bye weeks will have less flight data on FlightAware, or the flight number will have been reused for repositioning flights for other aircraft in the interim time between now and their last flight.  

3). Team flights to the UK are carried out by Virgin Atlantic, which uses Airbus A340-600 aircraft on direct flights from your team's airport to Heathrow. [Here's the Giants flight from last night](http://flightaware.com/live/flight/VIR9944/history/20161021/0041Z/KEWR/EGLL). Flight numbers vary for these flights but usually start with 994_. 

4). The Raiders use Airbus A330 aircraft from Hawaiian Airlines for all flights, Colts and Ravens use Boeing 777-200s for all flights. The rest of the teams use a mix of Boeing 767-300 & 400 models for long trips and Boeing 757-300 models for short hops, except for the Panthers and Cardinals who use Airbus A321's for their short hops.

One Lufthansa and one United.  Both were pretty cramped generally and seat width sucked and both adequately got me to my destination. But the quality of service and amenities on one vs. the other was just incredible.

Euro airlines give you vastly better food, hot towels, smiling friendly service, free booze (and plenty of it), much better and more advanced entertainment, little treats when you land, and the flight attendants seem much happier and eager to please.

Anyone disagree?","[""I have flown with AA in first class and can say that it was no better than  other airlines (BA, Lufthansa) Business class and substantially worse than Virgin Upper Class.\n\nA friend working for air traffic control reckons that sometimes US flights use diplomatic pressure to be allowed to continue services back to the US so they can be maintained there. When airlines get repairs done away from base, it can get expensive so they use pressure.\n\nLastly, what I can't understand is that many European airlines pay flight and cabin crew rather better than the US.\n\nSo, poor service, lower pay and maintenance issues - where are the US airlines putting the money!"", ""Try Asian next time, like Thai or Singapore.

After 9/11 they all went to the government begging for cash because they couldn't fly and everyone lost confidence. They're not forced to compete.\n\nI think this is also why it took Virgin America so long to get off the ground. The domestic US carriers lobbied the government to make it as difficult as hell for them because they knew it meant competition for them, and well, they hated it. I'm sure they're really hating it now.\n\nRichard Branson said the only US carriers which were actually in any way good were Southwest and JetBlue, which have the same roots so it's hardly surprising. I actually think former Southwest execs are helping run Virgin America too.\n\nI think one of the things that makes British Airways and Virgin Atlantic so good is their constant competitiveness with eachother.

144,Questions about Trump‚Äôs privatized ATC and safety (x-post /r/flying),2,6h8u0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/6h8u0y/questions_about_trumps_privatized_atc_and_safety/,8,1497488502.0,"I‚Äôm not a pilot at all. I have no experience with general aviation. I only ever fly commercial airlines (mostly Southwest) and fly in/out of airports in major metropolitan areas (SFO, SJC, LAX, SEA, ORD, and occasionally STL).  

I‚Äôve been hearing about Trump‚Äôs plan to privatize the air traffic control system in the US, and obviously it‚Äôs a pretty controversial move. If he‚Äôs able to accomplish what he wants - and my understanding is that he wants a system similar to what they have in Canada and Europe - what would American ATC look like?  

Specifically, how safe would such a system be? If a private corporation is running ATC and decides to cut corners to save money, couldn‚Äôt that lead to air traffic controllers being overwhelmed, tired, or stressed? If that‚Äôs the case, how much more dangerous would commercial air travel in the US be than it is today? Are there systems in place to ensure that, even if the air traffic controller screws up, two airplanes don‚Äôt collide during take-off or landing? Would TCAS be sufficient to prevent these types of disasters? How much more likely would an accident like [Tenerife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster), [the Charkhi Dadri incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charkhi_Dadri_mid-air_collision), or even that [episode from Breaking Bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABQ_(Breaking_Bad) be? Would there be a greater risk of these accidents at certain types of airports?  
Obviously, there are concerns about safety. I‚Äôm wondering if those fears are overblown or if, even if there *is* a slight decrease in safety, the system will still be pretty safe. After all, if the odds of a plane crash are, say, 0.00025% and those odds increase to 0.00026%, the risk has technically increased, but it‚Äôs still pretty low.    

The fact that privatized systems in Europe and Canada seem to work just fine is reassuring. But, from my limited understanding, it seems like the aviation community is split on privatization of ATC. I think one thing that‚Äôs definitely making me suspicious and wary is the fact that it‚Äôs Trump proposing it. ","['My understanding is that the proposed entity would be a private not-for-profit corporation. The current employees would still get federal retirement, and the FAA would still be the safety body. \nCanada did the same thing back in the 90s and it turned out just fine for them.\nThe proposed advantages would be the ability to borrow money to pay for upgrades to the nationwide ATC infrastructure to be paid for by fees the airlines (i.e. ticket buyers) pay for the services rendered. ', ""What the industry is promising with privatizing ATC is that we will get better equipment, our safety will improve, and we will be more efficient.\nWhen Trump announced his proposal, I just so happened to be sitting in a flight school with other colleagues while watching Trump broadcast the idea and sign his proposal. About every 2 statements he made, someone in the group debunked what he said. For instance, the notion that this will bring better equipment; we are already getting new equipment. The new equipment is part of the Next Gen system that is due by 2020 for instance, ADSB-out in aircraft is a mandatory requirement by the year 2020.\nBy privatizing the ATC you won't improve the industry, you will however take their retirement plans and change their current employer to a new one, someone who is new to the industry where a wrong move may literally cost hundreds of lives."", ""In my humble opinion, I am a defender of the FAA when it pertains but in regards to ATC, a move to a private service would benefit the industry. I do not think there would be such a thing as a company that has to cut corners or run on a tight budget. A company like this wouldn't even have the chance to be part of the industry, almost everybody is smart enough to start a business and not put themselves in risk of losing money. An exception to this in this very same industry is that of Trump, with his airline that did not adapt a bit to the era which it went through that eventually led to its demise. Privatizing would lead to higher propensity of implementing newer and more effective technologies, better employee management and better adaptation to the airport/area. The main fear of this move comes from FAA workers, which is the fear of losing their jobs, situation that is very unlikely. A privatized system with the FAA as nothing more than an overseer seems good to me."", "">If a private corporation is running ATC and decides to cut corners to save money,\n\nThat isn't how private corporations work.\n\n>I think one thing that‚Äôs definitely making me suspicious and wary is the fact that it‚Äôs Trump proposing it.\n\nSure, he ran a multi-billion dollar business empire for 30 years he obviously doesn't know anything about business, governance or finance /s"", ""Your second point doesn't prove anything.

149,PT Airliner Jobs in Las Vegas?,0,avy1lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/avy1lm/pt_airliner_jobs_in_las_vegas/,7,1551427785.0,"So, got a quick question - I'm considering a part-time gig for some extra money on the side. I have a full-time job that I have full flexibility with my schedule and I can work from home/remote. I've been eyeballing airline companies for awhile. With all the flexibility of my new full-time job though, working in an airliner has always been on the bucket list. I used to be a Hotel Manager on the Las Vegas Strip and I had a few front desk agents moonlight for an airliner. Although their positions were usually low pay and they dealt with pretty upset customers from time to time, they put up with it because of the benefits.

So here is the snag that I keep running into. I've been checking job/career pages for the last 8 months (on a biweekly basis) on the following airlines: Delta, American, Southwest, JetBlue, Virgin, British Air, Hawaiian, United, Air Canada, Norwegian, and even the locally based Allegiant. I haven't seen ANY job postings for Gate Agent, Customer Service Agent or Baggage Handler (normally the only PT gigs I see offered at airliners) on any of their career/jobs sites. I see Spirit is looking for a Stockclerk right now, but that looks like a full-time position.

There are always hiring opportunities outside of Las Vegas (especially in Denver, Phoenix, and LA it looks like), but it seems like the door it always shut here. Is there a different avenue I should be trying or is the turnover rate for these positions in Las Vegas so ridiculously low that hiring is never a necessity? Maybe someone who works on the inside could add some insight? :-)","[""You're probably better off in r/flying\n\nGood luck!"", ""LAS generally has high seniority employees, at least with my company. I know a guy that just left the station, has 34 years with the company and was the most junior there.

You might be better off trying in another city. If you can swing it you could probably get hired somewhere else and give all your shifts away, and work a few days a month. UA is hiring at DEN and is probably the best place to do that for you. AA is hiring too, but it's not a AA hub.\n\nonce you're in you can try to transfer to a better location."", 'I‚Äôd also look at third party handling companies too if you‚Äôre interested.

Thanks.', ""34 years? WOW...well...that was the confirmation I was looking for. I was thinking people could just transferring over as well. LAS does have a relatively low cost of living.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuess I will need to look into a different industry. Moving out of state isn't really an option.

163,Trying to categorize aircraft; looking for feedback.,2,ezxen,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/ezxen/trying_to_categorize_aircraft_looking_for_feedback/,7,1294739895.0,"I am trying to develop a model in order to organize aircraft.  It would be something similar to the way that airliners.net photo search engine, aircraft type field is organized, only more complete.  It's turning out to be a much more complicated task than I anticipated, and I need some feedback from other aviation buffs.

The idea is that an aircraft will be organized by manufacturer, then model, then variant.   The goal is that by the second column, it the model would have correctly defined the aircraft, and the third column only makes it more specific.  

It works fine at first.

    Airbus > A320 > A319
    Airbus > A330 > A330-200
    Boeing > 737 > 737-500
    Boeing > 777 > 777-200LR
    Supermarine > Spitfire > Spitfire Mark V

However I quickly run into problems.  The first problem I run into is manufacturer.  Often a company changes over the lifespan of an aircraft, or multiple companies may have worked together on development or production.  This results sometimes in different models for the same aircraft, and other problems.  I don't think hundreds of combinations of aircraft manufacturers is a good solution.

    Grumman/General Motors > TBF/TBM Avenger > TBM-3Q Avenger
    Grumman/General Motors > F4F/FM Wildcat > F4F-4 Wildcat
    General Dynamics/Lockheed Martin > F-16 Fighting Falcon > F-16A Fighting Falcon
    Hawker Siddeley > Hunter > Hunter F 6
    Hawker > Hurricane > Hurricane Mark III

Another situation is when one aircraft is derived from another, at what point is it separated out as it's own unique aircraft?

    Boeing > 747 > 747-8I
    Boeing > 747 > VC-25
    Boeing > 747 > 747 LCF Dreamlifter
    Boeing > C-135 Stratolifter > KC-135Q Stratotanker
    Boeing > C-135 Stratolifter > C-135B Stratolifter
    McDonnell Douglas/Boeing > F/A-18 Hornet > F/A-18C Hornet
    Boeing > F/A-18 Super Hornet > F/A-18F Super Hornet
    Douglas > DC-3 > C-47 Skytrain
    Lockheed/Lockheed Martin > C-130 Hercules > AC-130H Spectre
    Lockheed Martin > C-130 Super Hercules > C-130J Super Hercules

Finally, there are issues with aircraft names and designations.  For instance the NATO name for an aircraft, or changing designations.

    Antonov > An-72 ""Coaler"" > An-72AT ""Coaler-C""
    Mikoyan-Gurevich > MiG-29 ""Fulcrum"" > MiG-29S
    Mikoyan-Gurevich > MiG-21 ""Fishbed"" > MiG-21PF
    Cessna > Caravan > U-27A
    Cessna > Caravan > 208A Cargomaster
    Cessna > Skymaster > 337 Super Skymaster
    North American > P-51 Mustang > P-51D Mustang
    North American > P-51 Mustang > F-51B Mustang
    McDonnell Douglas/Boeing > F/A-18 Hornet > CF-118A Hornet
    Boeing > C-17 Globemaster III > CC-177 Globemaster III

I'd love to hear your feedback on how to overcome these obstacles, and whatever other suggestions you might have.

Thanks for reading!


**tldr;** I'm trying to create a model, something similar to the organization of living things (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species), but much simpler and regarding aircraft.","[""You need to talk to a database developer.  Basically, you need a much more complicated database structure than you think you do.  Initially you were looking at three tables: manufacturers, models, variants.  Each variant had one model, each model had one manufacturer.\n\nWith the problems you're running into, you'll need to allow multiple manufactrers per model, possibly with an intermediary table (models_manufacturers) that contains the relationships between manuf., models, and the years they were produced.\n\nFor the last problem, you may need yet ANOTHER table (model_alias) that contains aliases for certain models along with notes (who uses it).\n\nA database guy could straighten you out in a few minutes with a one-on-one conversation.  However, implementing it could take significantly more time depending on what yo're planning to do with this.    "", ""the key is that no one classification will fit an aircraft type.\n\nyou may be able to label an aircraft as Civil or Military, for eg.  But what if the particular aircraft type (not even at the model level) was used for both?\n\nSounds like you should be using attributes instead of attempting to create a hierarchical model.\n\nfor e.g. a PBY Catalina was used both by the military during the war, and by the coast guard and various firefighting groups post-war.  It was also used as a commercial passenger plane by China Airlines.\n\nAll three of these search paths should be able to resolve to a Catalina.\n\nYou could simply have a selection of checkboxes as your first search interface.  say:\n\n    [ ] Military\n    [ ] Civil\n    [ ] Commerical\n\nthen perhaps start listing attributes for the aircraft.\n\nIt's maybe not the most efficient way of doing it but it would probably be the most flexible."", 'We struggled with the same issues when building a database of just corporate jets / air taxi stuff, never mind the complexity of the rest of the universe, which I believe is much larger by comparison.  The answer given by **njovin** pretty much nails the challenges you\'ll run into.  \n\nGetting a standard aviation cladistics methodology down would be a huge task, but would make a handful of geeks get some OCD sense of order satisfaction.  When talking with the database developer, get an airplane geek to also take you through type certification, serial number series and other more root ways to identify the airframe.  For example, the root of what is now the Hawker 400XP is actually the Mitsubishi Diamondjet (300a or something.)  Anyway, that original aircraft (TC data sheet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_certificate) began with Mitsubishi (1980s), then Raytheon (1990s) who bought the TC data sheet from Mitsubishi, then sold onto a new company ""Hawker Beechcraft"" (sometime after 2004 I think) which is a spin of of what was Raytheon Aircraft Company.  (They prefer drones & more fun stuff like that now.)  \n\nAnyway, the legacy is that the TC data sheet is I think what you want to base your cladistics around. (The ""approved DNA"" if you will.)  A good example of a TC Data sheet being passed around (even going into hibernation) is the Twin Otter or DHC 6 formerly of DeHavilland Canada, then Bombardier.. who just (recently) sold the TC data sheet to a totally new and unrelated company called Viking Aircraft.  (After a hiatus of years.. the Twin Otter is being built again.) \n\nThe take away for your project?  Basically it is the same airplane, albeit lighter weight now and likely way improved over the original - but in the eyes of the FAA (and worldwide equivalents) it is the same airplane since it is the same TC data sheet.  Hope my help didn\'t make this more depressing and daunting.  But my sense is that getting a field populated with something that ties back to the original certification info might at least make the map make more sense, though no ordinary civilians will want to start their navigation of the tree there.  They\'ll need nice juicy things like ""CESSNA"" as a starting point.', 'Thanks for the info njovin.    While I completely agree with you about the structure of the database organizing the data.  My question is more about how I can display the data, and which way would make the most sense to divvy up the aircraft. \n\nSomething like the organization of living things (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species), but much simpler and regarding aircraft.', 'Yes, attributes would be the only possible way to do it right, and there are so many different possible attributes.  \n\nThe reason I wound up having the hierarchical model, and including what I did in it was for simplicity and definition.  I wanted all deviations of a similar aircraft to be grouped together under their parent name, so that anyone with a simple name like ""Mustang"" would be able to find it.  Then, I went back and added the manufacturer so that it would add some distinction between 2 aircraft with the same name.', ""This TC data sheet is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping for.   I found a great resource on the [FAA website](http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/MainFrame), though it doesn't appear to include military aircraft.   I assume their TC data sheets aren't as easy to come by."", 'Cool. The key thing in any cladistic thing is to try and think about the most original bones on the thing  / critter etc. Then work your way forward from there.  I think when it comes to airplanes, the key is the TC data sheet.  Be forewarned, things like the Let 410 UVP etc. (great airplane) may not have an FAA one since they were banned from US certification for no particular good reason other than maybe some cold war beef.  (More here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_L-410_Turbolet)  So your TC data sheet field should have options for ""who was the sovereign authority that made it safe to manufacture.""  That list might be US, Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, India, Italy.. etc. (not sure how long, but not terrible.)  Some of the Chinese aircraft will have original Russian TC data sheet equivalents.  (Just tie together obvious allies and partnerships since 1900 and it will make sense.)  But I think that is your best root beast to work your way forward from.  Re: military aircraft I\'ll scrounge around and see what I can find out amongst my warmonger friends in DC.  My guess is that animals like the JSF and F-22 Raptor have some type of sheet.  We mere mortals may not be able to see it until 2034 when they finally let India (or whoever) make them.\n']"

I don't know if anyone else here gets these alerts, but in case possibly not, I got an alert regarding a general emergency squawk transponder code that is on this particular flight. American Airlines 3957 appears to ask walk the general emergency code sometime after what appears to have been a go around on an Easter North eastbound runway assuming they are on final approach or even short final at 1200 to 1500 ft above sea level before suddenly picking up speed and climbing to at least 4,000 ft and not very much time. The time that the emergency transponder code was entered looks like around when they started to make their northbound turn in that large holding pattern they entered after what I believe again to ba go around. can anyone speculator possibly get info even from the airline as to what happened here? My assumption or best guess rather would be a low fuel emergency had to be declared. Although, I would think on a flight that isn't terribly long such as this one that they could afford to contain 2 to 5,000 or even more pounds of extra fuel. Perhaps though that is not economically to do or is just poor practice.

What factors drive the much higher crew rate for AAL, I would imagine it deals with Union issues, they are they only airline on this list that also has furloughed pilots although I understand that they are returning to work. Even accounting for the furloughs their rate is almost 12 per plane.

What generally accounts for this?  Is American less efficiently run, or does it have to do more with equipment changes in their fleet or some gearing up for anticipated retirement?
","[""Also keep in mind crew requirements for short haul vs. long haul. Airlines like JetBlue and Southwest don't operate long-haul flights so each segment only requires two pilots.

"", ""On long hauls does the same set of crews tend to stick together through all phases or do the deadhead pilots even in those circumstances?\n\nThe other thing I learned (I think) is that airline pilots can deadhead with any airline in a lot of situations. Did I read that right?

They'll then spend a night in a hotel then operate back the next day.  I'm not in-flight so I can't offer the best explanations for it if there's any specific questions you have. \n\nDeadhead and reciprocal jumpseat policies vary. It's a scratch-each-others-back deal that's negotiated between individual airlines depending on what their needs are.

Departure time. Why are American Airline like always getting delays/cancellations? And why do the Airlines seem like they have no interest in fixing it?","[""Europe has a lot more consumer rights laws.\n\nThere's practically no penalty in the US for a delayed or cancelled flight, so they pack the schedule to the utmost limit, and any mishap or weather throws the house of cards into chaos. "", 'So, the first thing is I think you\'ve been unlucky.  \n\n[Statistically, US airlines are about 5% more delayed then European airlines](https://www.oag.com/hubfs/Free_Reports/Punctuality_League/2018/PunctualityReport2018.pdf?).  Some of the US airlines are more reliable then major European airlines - Delta\'s on time performance was 82% in 2017, higher then SAS, KLM, British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, SWISS in the same year.  Hawaiian air is even better - they\'re 87% OTP beats all European airlines except AirBaltic, which achieved 90%.\n\nAs for why, there are a number of reasons:\n\n1. A larger percentage of space constrained airports.  Rebuilding after the second World War offered the opportunity to relocate airfields outside of city limits, creating larger airports with more modern runway layouts.  CDG, AMS, MUC, ZRH, LIS, FCO all opened during or shortly after world war II, and serve as hub airports for major European airlines, and the major access points for their respective cities.  Compare that to BOS, LGA, MDW, DCA, and others, all major US airports, which are 100% size constrained and face delays as they are 100% utilized at peak.  Of course there are exceptions on both sides - LHR is famously constrained, and airports in the US like DEN are the opposite.  In general, WWII offered a ""fresh slate"" in Europe which was not seen in the US.\n\n2. Lower penalties for delays.  As pobody already commented, the US has less penalties for delayed and cancelled flights.  \n\n3. Customers select for cheaper flights not more reliable.  The number one reason a consumer chooses one flight over another is cost, not OTP.  [Statistically, people will even choose cheaper flights over safer flights](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/you-get-what-you-pay-for-passengers-choosing-price-over-airline-safety), so you can see that something like on time performance is going to be a distant part of the equation.  Additionally, statistical information about on time performance is not shown by all booking websites or providers, so many consumers are making their choice without even knowing if there is a large difference in on time performance between one carrier and another.\n\n4. Weather - The US in general has more weather related delays and cancellations, as the US has more extreme weather then Europe.  Hurricanes are rare in Europe - they effect a large portion of the US every year.  Same with large storms like Nor\'easters, flooding, and large snowfall percentages.  The US suffers weather which halts flights more frequently then Europe.\n\n', 'Come fly though China with me and you‚Äôll be praising the U.S. lol ', ""But Still, why don't they have a desire to fix it.

191,Story - Executive One Foxtrot,21,61pbpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/61pbpw/story_executive_one_foxtrot/,6,1490607073.0,"#Credit to [Ron Wagner on Quora](https://www.quora.com/Which-air-traffic-controller-or-controllers-annoyed-you-the-most/answer/Ron-Wagner-2) - felt r/aviation would appreciate it.

---

I was flying ‚ÄúExecutive One Foxtrot,‚Äù which is the First Family. Three calls signs get special treatment, basically like being an emergency all the time, and those are ‚ÄúAir Force One,‚Äù ‚ÄúAir Force Two‚Äù (VP), and ‚ÄúExecutive One Foxtrot.‚Äù They do NOT hold. EVER! Controllers are supposed to know that, ESPECIALLY a DC area controller.

We were going home to Andrews AFB in August on one of those horrid days with thunderstorms cells all over the place. We were coming in from the west, which meant we had to dodge all the buildups across the whole place to get to ADW on the far eastern side.

**INSANELY BUSY FREQUENCY:** When I came up on Washington approach control‚Äôs frequency, it was a mad house. The controller was firing off holding instructions as fast as possible to American, United, Delta, Northwest, etc. Machine gun words.

This is a complicated radio call, too, not short and sweet. It has to include a radial, a distance, an altitude, a direction and a time to expect to get out of holding. The pilots then, technically, have to read it all back, which would further tie up the radio. But these were experienced pros, seasoned enough to reply with not much more than ‚ÄúRoger.‚Äù

**BREAKING IN:** You have to carefully time your initial call on a day like this, so as not to step on a conversation. Very unprofessional. It‚Äôs kind of like jumping on a moving merry-go-round. You watch the pace and pick your place.

I listened to the rhythm of the calls and after about four sets of machine-gun holding instructions, I finally sensed a moment to key my mic, ‚ÄúWashington Approach, Executive One Foxtrot at eight thousand.‚Äù

‚ÄúExecutive One Foxtrot, hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.‚Äù The time was about 45 minutes away. I don‚Äôt know what else he said because I didn‚Äôt need that crap, because I wasn't going to hold.

‚ÄúNegative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed to Andrews on a 140 heading, deviating a couple of times to dodge buildups, then descend on the other side of the Potomac and turn north into Andrews.‚Äù

‚ÄúExecutive One Foxtrot. Negative, negative! We‚Äôve got traffic stacked up all over the area. Hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed direct Andrews as I said before.‚Äù

This poor guy was about to pop a gasket.

‚ÄúEXECUTIVE ONE FOXTROT. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. IMMEDIATELY ACKNOWLEDGE THE HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEED AS DIRECTED.‚Äù

I figured I needed to say my call sign loud and very slowly so the supervisor on the frequency would hear me, jump in, and save this guy from himself.

‚ÄúApproach. This is ***EXECUTIVE! ____ ONE! ____ FOXTROT!*** We WILL proceed direct Andrews on this 140 heading, then we‚Äôll descend and turn northbound after we cross the Potomac.‚Äù

**THAT DID THE TRICK:** The next call was a different voice. Very deep, very calm, and silky smooth. A movie casting director would have hired this guy for the quintessential controller voice.

‚ÄúExecutive One Foxtrot, roger, proceed as you stated. Do you need to deviate while you‚Äôre on the 140?‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger, we‚Äôll have to deviate a bit left and right on that heading, but we can basically hold it until we‚Äôre south of Andrews, then turn north on our own. We‚Äôll stay at eight thousand until we cross the Potomac. We won‚Äôt bother you folks with vectors or anything else.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger, Executive One Foxtrot, cleared as stated. My apologies for that, sir, he‚Äôs brand new to the DC area. That won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù

He obviously did not want me to have the White House call him when I landed. It‚Äôs guaranteed that young controller never made that mistake again.

I always wondered what the airline pilots on the frequency thought about that exchange.","['""Now the thing to understand about approach controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, frantic, high, unprofessional, tone that made one feel unimportant.""', 'I would have started laughing to myself if I heard this on frequency especially in DC', ""> what the airline pilots on the frequency thought\n\nHuh - I thought these flights used the mil freqs, so avoided the jam up on the civilian freqs.  Sometimes you hear half the conversation - the controllers half - when they're talking to military traffic"", ""Is it always Executive One Foxtrot for the First Family? I know that for the President or the Vice President it would only be Executive One if the pilot is not a member of the military, if the pilot was Air Force it would be Air Force One, Marine pilot makes it Marine One, etc. I know that 'Foxtrot' is included in the call sign because it's Foxtrot for F, or First Family, but do the rest of the naming conventions not apply to the First Family? (Air Force One Foxtrot, Marine One Foxtrot, etc)."", 'It\'s about the service of the aircraft, not necessarily the pilot. And for whichever call sign that would be used if the president were on board, ""Foxtrot"" is simply added if only the first family is on board.

On final approach after flaps and gear were deployed approaching MSP, the plane entered a noticeably steeper descent that continued for maybe 5-15 seconds. The engines then went to full power and the aircraft leveled off, staying at full power for another estimated five seconds before smoothly entering a fairly steep climb out. 

I knew instantly it was an aborted landing and watched MSP sail by below before the pilot came over the intercom and announced he opted to ‚Äúgo around due to an unstable approach.‚Äù

We circled the city and came back on for one of the smoothest landings I‚Äôve ever experienced. My hat is off the the flight crew. But I‚Äôm just curious what actually happened.

If a pilot found themselves in a situation where the aircrafts elevators ‚Äúmalfunctioned‚Äù with no procedures, what would could they do to regain control of the aircraft? Increase power? ","['The issue is not terribly concerning from a safety standpoint now that the issue has been identified and pilots are vigilant of what might happen and how to manage it.  The issue has to do with a system that measures the angle of attack.  Upon analyzing the black box on the Lion Air flight, it became apparent that the aircraft received erroneous information from the AOA sensor which made the airplane think it was close to a stall.  The MAX has stall prevention logic very much like the Airbus that will ""force"" the nose down to prevent the aircraft from stalling.  On the MAX, this is accomplished via the elevator trim.  In practice, this is very much like a ""runaway trim"" condition and the resolution is to disconnect the electric trim.  The B737 can be trimmed manually using the ""big wheels"" on either side of the throttles, so once the electric trim is disconnected the aircraft will fly normally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find it fascinating that American admitted they were not aware of this feature.  It appears in Boeing\'s operating manual on the aircraft, which the American B737 MAX8 Aircraft Operation Manual is predicated on.  The logical conclusion is that American failed to include this information in the AOM and the FSDO authorized this manual without noticing the omission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr. American might have just screwed the pooch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn direct answer to your general question of ""what does a crew do when a malfunction has no procedure for resolution"" the answer comes down to a crew\'s understanding of the aircraft systems and limitations and experience.  There are several instances in aviation history where a crew\'s understanding of how his airplane works has saved the day.  United 232 is a good example.  United 811 and the cargo door failure is another great example.', ""simply increasing power is not the solution. Of course there are some examples where you can maneuver a plane just with the engines (I think it was Sioux City), but in general you need the elevators to get the plane into a certain position (angle), as lift is created with the wings only (passenger planes).\n\nSo, no elevator control = pilots are passengers with a good view!\n\nFirst thing is to get back control. And if this requires a procedure that isn't documented, it either takes experience or luck.\n\nAs I am of course not familiar with the systems of a 737, I would expect that manual entry overrides any computer input. This seems to be the case for the old 737 models, but not for the new ones. So the pilot MUST know about options to solve these situations.\n\nIf you don't know why something is wrong, you cannot solve the problem. you are only correcting the results, then.\n\nSo: knowledge is the only key to solve these sort of problems. Only sometimes experience helps."", ""As /u/gsarducci pointed out, this situation IS in the FCOM. It's just a runaway trim system which is easily recognized and dealt with. The actual cause of the trim runaway is irrelevant. What surprises me is the pilots union coming out and saying they were unaware of the problem when it's right there in the FCOM."", ""Just to note, the elevators didn't malfunction in this accident, but the horizontal stabiliser trim provided nose down trim that wasn't expected nor sucessfully counted.\n\nIf the elevators malfunctioned, there are other methods of getting some/partial pitch control. Most jet aircraft provide pitch trim by changing the incidence of the entire horizontal stabiliser (tilting it slightly up or down relative to the nose). As you can see from this accident, pitch trim can produce significant nose up or nose down commands. This would be a possible method to use following elevator malfunction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 737, like a large portion of jet airliners, has the engines under the centre of gravity. Increasing thrust to the engines will result in a nose up pitch. Reducing thrust will result in a nose down pitch. \n\nOf note, the crew in DC-10 crash in Sioux City made use of thrust to help control the aeroplane.

My question is why is the average airspeed faster for the NYC to Santo Domingo flght when the same jet is being used for the Miami to Santo Domingo flight? Is there something in the Bermuda Triangle (i.e heavy winds) that slows the plane down? Are the pilots intentionally flying slower for some reason?

This is due to the increase in true airspeed as the atmosphere's density decreases. Therefore, the longer a flight, the more time is spent in cruise, and the average airspeed increases.
