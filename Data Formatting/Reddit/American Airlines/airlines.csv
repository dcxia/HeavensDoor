According to [https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html](https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html)

""Passengers will be able to hold a reservation without payment, or cancel a booking without penalty, for 24 hours after the reservation is made, if they make the reservation one week or more prior to a flight’s departure date.""

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

So I disputed the $200 fee with my bank, and just now I've realized that I lost the dispute.

As for the 3rd party, if it was a 3rd party who booked this, it was an @travelersdesks.com email address who sent me confirmation. Does anyone know what company this is? I was in contact with them through Delta's direct customer service line +18002211212 from an agent claiming to be a supervisor.","['Did you ask to change it, or ask to cancel it?', 'Edit to update my understanding of what happened, original reply at the end\n\nI just go through your post again and realise something. From what I understand, here is what happened:\n\n1, you called Delta to request for a change, which Delta does not allow. What Delta can do according to their terms and the US law, is to fully refund you the ticket.\n\n2, you argued with Delta, supervisor ended up refunding the DL ticket entirely, which is $143.\n\n3, Supervisor booked you the AA flight via a 3rd party website (because DL don\'t sell AA tickets), which cost you $200. Hence the $200-$143=$57 save you mentioned.\n\n4, You think the $200 for the AA flight is change fee and dispute it with your bank but failed.\n\nSo, can you help me out and clarify something?\n\nWhen you request the change, is the new flight still a Delta flight with the same price? Or did you propose the AA flight from the beginning?\n\nHow much was the AA flight if you book it through AA directly? Any chance it is $200?\n\nI am asking this is because I think DL isn\'t at fault here after all. They refunded you the cost of the Delta flight as you mentioned, which means they comply with their own rule and the US law. They then helped you booked another flight even though it\'s not their flight.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but it seems like what you are saying is that after you made the mistake of booking the wrong flight, not only do Delta have to refund you the ticket, but they should also pay for your new ticket at no cost to you?\n\nSo what you are paying, is not the ""change fee"", it\'s the price for the AA flight that you wanted.\n\nUnless Delta used your credit card to pay for the AA flight without your consent, I don\'t see why your bank should approve the dispute here. But they won\'t have that information unless you give it to them.\n\n_________________________Original reply below_____________________________\n\nFrom what you describe, it looks like you may have purchased the ticket from a 3rd party website and the Delta call centre agent may have put you with the 3rd party to resolve the issue.\n\nI can’t say for certain without more information. But call centre agents sometimes can initiate a 3-way call while the customer is still on the line. What it means is that they put you on-hold, then they dial the 3rd party for you, wait for the call to be answer by its agent and explain the situation then patch you through. Once you and the 3rd party is connected, the Delta agent may then disconnect from the call. They do this so customers don’t have to hang-up and dial another number and explain the whole situation again. Because of this, it would appeared as you just called Delta, but in fact you were dealing with the 3rd party who sell you the ticket.\n\nThe only way you can receive a e-mail from that 3rd party is because you booked with them. Otherwise they won’t have the authority to change your ticket.\n\nAs for the US law part, the practise is usually they fully refund the ticket to you then you purchase whatever ticket you want. The law did not specify that airlines and travel agents have to allow change. As long as they give you a loss-less option defined by the law, then it’s legal.\n\nAlso, the law only apply to transaction happened in the US, so if the 3rd party is registered outside of US and princess that transaction outside of US, they are not obligated to follow that law. If you use the airlines overseas website, because the transaction is not process in US dollar or by their US offices, the law also doesn’t apply.', 'Did you personally book this flight on delta.com? Not a 3rd party like Expedia or a company travel portal like concur.

Basically, even after DL has refunded the original ticket, OP still think DL should change the ticket free of charge. \n\nFor argument sake, let\'s say DL should change the ticket free of charge, then at best DL owes OP $57 ($200-$143).

I paid $143 (original flight) + $200 (flight change fee) + $350 (AA flight) = $693.

From what little I can find online, and the fact that their website is a default page, it sounds like a mailer domain for a third-party travel agent. When Delta, AA, or United send an email, it comes from their main domain.\n\nGenerally, one airline isn't going to book you on another airline's flight, especially on short notice like this. That usually only happens when there's a codeshare or some other pre-planned agreement to do so.

We arrived New York 5 hours prior to our connecting flight and wanted to take an earlier flight and were willing to pay the $75 standby fee (same day) the agent said our ticket didn't apply.  We did buy the cheapest tickets available but if there are seats open on an earlier flight   - I don't get it why the airline would not want to fill those and open up our seats to hopefully sell to someone else?  Why wouldn't they? Now our scheduled flight is running late.  To me  - we should all do the right thing; especially when it's all the same to us.  It doesn't hurt anyone.  Any thoughts as to why a company would do this ,"['Because airlines are not charities.\n\n>We did buy the cheapest tickets available\n\n...then, you got what you paid for.', 'If you bought a basic economy ticket, one of the things you give up in exchange for the lower fare is the ability to change your flight. If you don’t like it, buy a more expensive ticket that includes that flexibility. Limiting what you can do on a cheaper ticket is how they encourage people to buy up to a more expensive one.', ""Airlines practice third degree price discrimination by charging leisure travelers less and business travelers more. Obviously they can't discern between these two markets, except that business travelers tend to purchase tickets closer to the date of departure and leisure travelers book well in advance. Business travelers are less price elastic - they care less about cost and more about convenience. So by making ticket prices higher the closer you get to the date of travel, they maximize their revenues from both market segments. Because you booked a leisure ticket for cheap, they don't want to move you to another flight that might still have the possibility of being sold to a last minute business traveler willing to purchase a full fare ticket for 4-5 times as much as you purchased yours. Allowing agents to make exceptions in these types of circumstances might seem harmless at first, but as the practice spreads it could lead to a loss of potential revenue."", ""That's what that lowest fare is for.  It's no frills and extra cheap, but you also cannot voluntarily change your flight at all.  To do that, you have to buy the main fare ticket.  \n\nThe reason for that is the low fares do a great job at competing with other low-fare airlines, but they lose money on most of those seats.  They used to make that up a little by not allowing carry-on luggage, but passengers were such a nightmare over it that they switched the policy, and really cracked down on seat placement and changing flights voluntarily.  \n\nWhile most people try to coerce the ticket/gate agents to change their seats for free - which we have limited ability to do - some people go ahead and pay the extra for seat placement, which helps make up some of the loss on ticket cost.\n\nGenerally, by the day of the flight, and especially by the ten minutes before the flight leaves that most people ask, those fare tickets are completely booked.  So moving you to an earlier flight would then be switching you to a higher fare seat.\n\nI understand your reasoning - that the seat is empty anyway.  However, you assume that your original seat could then be sold to someone else - which almost never happens, and isn't even possible within two hours of the flight. \n\nIt also can throw off things like weights and balances when a last minute aircraft change occurs.\n\nIf, in the future, you think you will need to be flexible on the day of flying, I'd recommend purchasing a full fare ticket.  Or if you purchase a ticket for early in the day and something was to happen, you have a lot more wiggle room in your plans."", ""There is very little chance that your seats would be filled at the last minute. In a broader sense, date changes decrease revenue because with people constantly changing dates, you don't know which flights will be in high demand."", 'Flights are pre set with the expected number of pax for that one flight, they set up the expected number of meals, staffing, fuel loads and such based upon that number.  To change a large portion pax is cost prohibitive for the company.  When you purchase a saver fare you forgo changes, upgrades and other things that are normally expected at a regular fare.  \n\nOur company’s saver fare is great for the pax, but sucks for the agents.  The pax are told numerous times during the reservation that it’s not designed for more than one person, you don’t get to choose seats and other things.  They then get pissed off because they want to sit together, window seats change flights, elite upgrades and such and when they are told no, they blame us.  When they are told that you agreed to it four times they still go, but and expect it anyway and in the result the agents and flight attendants are getting pissed off because they can’t deliver what the general public expects from the company. \n\nEdit- Hate to tell you but all the other airlines have the same policy os saver fares.

But I can see the $$ aide as well. Thanks for the responses. ', ""I didn't read your post、but it sounds like you are too entitled. Flying is a prvillage not a right. "", 'Your argument doesn’t make any sense.  The poster is saying the airline would make more money if they allowed the poster to fly on their desired flight.  If you don’t think that’s true, at least provide a reason why.\n\nI have run into situations on several occasions where an airline has insisted on making decisions that lose them money for no apparent reason, so I’m interested in this topic.', 'I get what you are saying. I still don’t get why they won’t let me pay for a standby ticket. It ended up our fight home was full with a lot of standbys so it seems logical to move people when they can. ', 'Thank you for explaining. This makes sense. ', 'Do they really lose money on those seats?  If so, why would they sell them at all?  The marginal cost of one more passenger, beyond taxes, is so low that it is hard to believe they could be losing money.', 'Clearly, so is spelling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd reading...', ""Airlines have to bid for airspace and routing.  That's part of the reason why you see a direct flight is very expensive, while a flight that has two layovers to the same destination is very cheap.  \n\nLegacy airlines generally have the ability to bid for the more expensive airspace, and budget airlines often fly cheaper airspace.  That gives the budget airlines more wiggle room with their prices.\n\nFor legacy airlines to compete on pricing with budget airlines, they need to offer lower prices, but that doesn't mean they pay less for the routing they have.  So on many of the basic economy tickets, they are not charging what the seat actually costs.\n\nBut, the benefit is that more one-time flyers may choose the legacy airline to fly.  Very few basic economy customers do not purchase anything extra.  Checked bag fees have gone up $5 per bag in the last few months, and people who travel together on basic economy often purchase their seats so that they can sit together.  So the little extras help make up for the loss the airlines might take on an individual ticket.\n\nAlso, basic economy customers cannot change their flights last minute, or get a refund on their tickets.  So if they want to change at all, they have to buy a new ticket.  If the person is serious about changing, they end up purchasing a new ticket.  If they are not, they don't.  (And very few people are actually prepared to pay the $75 fee to change anyway.  Most expect a free standby.)  If you cannot fly for any reason, there is no refund.  So that actually means there are many tickets purchased that are simply not used, which also offsets the cost.\n\nIt's interesting that legacy airlines were flying in the red until bag fees were introduced.  Then they started to make profits again.  Those little extras we all hate are actually what are keeping us all flying."", 'Haha. ', 'So I think what you are saying is that, given all those extras, they aren’t losing money on average in those seats.\n\nAlso, I’m talking more about the marginal cost.  Given that they already paid for the airspace and have the plane going from point A to B anyway, I find it hard to believe that the marginal cost is below the price of the ticket.', ""Kind of.  What I'm saying is that the ability of the extras to potentially make revenue is what allows legacy airlines to offer the lower fare, even if the fare itself is at a loss.\n\nAre you asking about the marginal cost of a single passenger flying standby a single time?  Yes, then that would not lose them money, except in possible added fuel needed for extra passengers.\n\nHowever, that's something that doesn't hold up in the long term. Flights that routinely have low loads, or are cancelled/delayed often are put on a critical list for review as to whether it's worth the cost to keep it running.  If there's a flight that every day is only booked to ten people, then the flight will eventually be taken away and the money placed elsewhere.  It doesn't matter how many bodies actually went on the flight, when you count in standbys and employees.  If only ten people actually paid for that flight, that's all the money they made on it.\n\nSo while in the short term it may not cost much more to book one flight then hop onto another, in the long term, all of those numbers are carefully considered against cost.  Flights are eliminated or added based on those numbers.  \n\nAlso, if the majority of people are booking basic economy (which they are now that they can carry on luggage again), that again has to be taken into account when considering the cost of flying that route in the future.  If they can't make up the cost of that flight with lower fares, then in the future the flight will be eliminated.  ""]"
3,American Airlines is Pitiful,8,c52hf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/c52hf4/american_airlines_is_pitiful/,28,1561465924.0,"2 weekends ago I flew with AA round trip, with four flights scheduled. During the span of the trip I ended up getting both (2) of the front leg flights cancelled (NOT DUE TO WEATHER) and had to scram to get rebooked so I could get to where I needed. 

One was scheduled maintenance and the other was Air Traffic?! 

Why is there SCHEDULED maintenance when there is a flight booked, that should be on you to schedule better. And air traffic flow , also on AA. I got rebooked but it was stressful and lost me a couple of precious hours and I ended up running a 5k for cancer research on 3 hours sleep. 

After reaching out to American Airlines all they did was blame the weather which proved that they didn’t even read my complaint and that they don’t care about customers. 

I’ll be taking my business elsewhere from here on out.","['I think you’re taking “scheduled” maintenance a little too literally. It means something broke right before it was to take your flight and needed to be fixed.', '>And air traffic flow , also on AA.\n\nNeither American nor any other airline have any control over air traffic control. Air traffic control services in the United States are provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is a part of the federal government. \n\nI’m not surprised that you had a flight cancelled due to maintenance. Relations between the airline and the mechanics are so strained that AA is suing the mechanics’ union alleging an illegal slowdown. Don’t fly American if getting to your destination on time is important to you.', ""Airlines don't control air traffic. Of the weather is bad, and an airport needs to increase time between takeoffs -- such as fog -- then airlines will have to cancel or delay some flights. The FAA decides that, and the airlines have to scramble. \n\nWeird that american blamed scheduled maintenance rather than just maintenance. If it was scheduled, my guess is that the m&e group was slower than expected getting the aircraft back in service."", ""Scheduled maintenance happens when something breaks that isn't immediately fixable and needs a part or maintenance worker to arrive.\n\nWeather and air traffic often go hand in hand.  If weather causes a back up of flights arriving or leaving an airport, there will be too much air traffic at one time, and planes have to be held back to get everything out without running into each other.\n\nI do understand the frustration. Summer is always the hardest traveling season.  Since so many more people are traveling for vacations and events they couldn't during the school year, there are more planes in the sky, and so much more air traffic.  Then add on the freakish weather we have, and it blows up pretty quickly.\n\nI do hope you find what you're looking for with your travel on another airline, though."", 'As a pilot for an aa regional, we are sorry. We try, but cancellations are outside of our control.', 'Like others have said, this is related to ATC which no airline can control and a labor disagreement between M&E and the airline.  It was probably scheduled and had plenty of time, but the maintenance “took longer” because of the labor dispute.  I don’t work for that airline, but I deal with their issues on a daily basis and their pax are always happier when flying with us.', 'They don’t care about your business, they’re a bloated oligopoly that pride themselves in mediocrity and your inconvenience is not their concern.', 'American unfortunately has become the absolute worst. They are horribly disorganized, and the most expensive, after all the fees. I booked on them with airline miles and ended up with $583 in fees STILL. I don’t hate on people who work for the airline, I’ve met some delightful flight crews for AA. But they’re a mess. I know there are things that happen that can’t be avoided, but man, American screwed me over on my honeymoon and I vowed not to ever give them money again.', 'I wholeheartedly agree.  They keep hinging their flight schedules on the max returning when they shouldn’t even plan on them until next year.  We have refused acceptance of ours and are being stored with Boeing and won’t get them till the FAA, our company and our pilots union approves them.  \n\nSouthwest has been completely screwed up this year from the same issues, even worse than AA.', 'Yep my aunt used to be a head flight attendant for AA and she said it’s now a horrible airlines', 'You leave to work the same time every day but one day you end up being late due to traffic. Was that your fault that you were late because of traffic? Or were there unforeseen circumstances that caused more traffic this particular day? (A wreck, construction, weather, etc.) \n\nJust like you can’t control the traffic wherever you go, It’s the exact same thing in the air.', 'Actually no. Scheduled maintenance is required after a certain number of hours, days or flights (every aircraft is different) and has many different levels to them. For example, an ""A Check"" is typically done on an overnight and needs to be completed after XXX number of flight hours.  The scheduled maintenance typically takes a 10 hour block of time (from the time it enters maintenance\'s hands to when it is done).  Airlines ""schedule"" these planes to sit longer overnight to complete, but if the plan is scheduled to arrive at 8pm the night before, but doesnt get in until 10pm, its going to be late coming out the next morning.  \n\n\nConversely, AA is also having a problem with maintenance taking longer for these overnight maintenance events, so instead of 10 hours, its taking 12 hours... meaning the plane is coming out in time.  This is due to a contract fight between the union and the airline.  \n\n\nBut there is most definitely ""scheduled maintenance"".  Every aircraft has them, and at different intervals.', 'Fly Delta instead.', 'This is partially correct. When the weather gets bad (or even mediocre) in a given region, ATC must increase distances between aircraft. When that happens, there are fewer aircraft able to be handled in a given area, so ATC does flow control measures. That really is region/airport specific on what that means.    \n\n\nBut typically if it happens at an airport, the airline is told that they will have XX number of operations per hour. The airline then decides which flights are cancelled to meet that maximum number of operations. So the airline will then go through and figure out what are the least important flights using a myriad of metrics.    \n\n\nBut it is rarely if ever decided by ATC/FAA that ""XXXX flight must be cancelled"".  Its the airline\'s decision, but something that is out of their control, like with weather.', ""> If it was scheduled, my guess is that the m&e group was slower than expected getting the aircraft back in service.\n\nAmerican Airlines mechanics working slowly?

Stuff they normally defer they are fixing now.', 'Right now it’s hard to control variation when they lost a good amount of aircraft due to the Max grounding.  There are too many variables to really determine what the real reason is.  If it’s labor, you’re right it’s no excuse, but ATC and loss of aircraft is kind of out of their control.

American Airlines compensation.",0,4uzf4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/4uzf4e/emergency_landing_fixed_break_not_working/,16,1469718270.0,"The other day my girlfriend and her family and I all flew from San Diego to New York with a layover in North Carolina with American Airlines. While attempting to land our pilot aborted the landing and explained that their was a plane on the run way. We proceed to circle the air port for the next 30-60 minutes before the pilot asks all flight attendants to please call him. Minutes later the pilot explains that we have a situation and the breaks on the plane are not working and we will be making an emergency landing. The flight attendants proceed to review the emergency card with all passengers and how to properly assume the brace position for landing. At this time my girlfriend begins hysterical crying as do a few others on the plane. I am sitting their a nervous wreck praying we land and don't crash. Minutes later we assume the brace position and luckily land safely. The pilot comes over the loud speaker to explain that the break indicator must be broken and we landed safely. A day later I and every other passenger receive an email from American Airline for a $140.00 flight voucher. However I don't believe this is nearly enough compensation for the stress they put on me and my girlfriend, especially considering we will be flying to Paris with American Airlines this Friday, less than a week from the incedent. This incident has caused me and my girlfriend to become stressed about our next flight. 


Do you believe this $140 is a reasonable compensation for the stress induced and the delay it cause us getting back to New York? If not what would you suggest I ask for as compensation from American Airlines when I call them tomorrow morning?


The way I look at it is I would pay 140 dollars to not experience one of the most frightening situations in my life.


Late at night here, sorry for the terrible grammar and wall of text. I just would like to hear your opinions on the situation and if you have any useful information.

TLDR; Told the breaks don't work, assume brace position for emergency landing. spend an hr in the air circling the airport, land safely and only compensated 140 dollars for one of the scariest moment of my life and i must fly again with american this Friday.","[""I can understand that some people have a fear of flying.

Then I read one of your replies...\n\nYou're overly dramatic, don't understand the contract you agreed to when buying the ticket and have unrealistic expectations.\n\nPlanes are machines. No matter how well an airline maintains its aircraft, a machine will have malfunctions. It's American so it kind of surprises me they offered compensation unsolicited in the first place. The airline did the right thing, you got what you paid for, and you'll be fine on your next flight with American."", 'Additional to what others have said, your terms will state that the contract is to get you to your destination *in a timely manner*, they are not beholden to getting you there at exactly 5.

Not a flight that causes me to miss my connector. Not a flight which requires me me to tuck my head between my knees as we land. Not a flight in which they out right lie to the passengers and tell them a plane was on the runway when in reality we are are circling the area due to a ""broken break"". Not a flight that gets me home  ( to New York) more than 2.5 hour later than expected. It not a fear of flying that I have, It is a fear of flying and landing in a plane which was clearly broken (the severity of which was unknown at the time). I would like to be compensated for the stress it caused me and many of the other passengers as well as the time this broken piece of equipment caused me to lose. $140 flight voucher is not worth the stress of worrying about a broken piece of equipment. Also I should have been a little bit more clear the pilot explained the brakes were not working not just a single break. \n\nI disagree with your opinions, but thank you for the honest response.\n\nThanks again\n-Alanm4a2', ""You are correct in that I don't understand the contract I agreed to(any clifnotes would be appreciated).

"", '> they out right lie to the passengers and tell them a plane was on the runway when in reality we are are circling the area due to a ""broken break""\n\nThere\'s no proof anybody lied.  The brakes issue may have appeared after a legitimate go-around due to another plane on the runway.\n\n> flying and landing in a plane which was clearly broken\n\nIt wasn\'t broken when they took off.  If something happened in the air, do you just want to keep flying until you run out of fuel and eventually crash?  Gotta land eventually, brakes or no brakes.  The flight crew are professionals and they know how to react and cope with these scenarios.\n\nThe reality is airplanes are extenstively mechanical machines with lots of moving parts, lots of electronics, etc.  and occasionally some of them will fail.  Still, most systems are redundant (ie issues with left brakes might not affect right brakes).\n\nIf something on your car breaks, are you emotionally traumatized?  If you burst a tire going down the highway, yeah it could be dangerous, but shit happens and you deal with it.\n\n>I paid for a flight that would get me to North Carolina at 4 not a flight that gets me there at 5\n\nI think you\'re pushing it here.  Even with a 2.5hr final delay, that\'s still within the stricter compensation rules of some countries.  The $140 is a goodwill gesture for your stress, not the delay.  You\'re more than welcome to ask for more, but of course YMMV.  Being polite and diplomatic when you call will help, but frankly I wouldn\'t expect too much more, maybe a double of the amount.', ""Before I respond...\n\nCan you share the flight number and exact day the emergency landing took place? I believe your limited knowledge of aircraft and aviation may be why you are more upset than those of us listening to your story. If you share the flight number and date of the flight, I can listen to the ATC tapes and try to give you some insight based on what the flight crew says to ATC.\n\nNow my response...\n\nNo cliff notes needed. The full Conditions of Carriage, as American calls it, are easily viewed on their website: https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#responsibilityschedulesandoperations\n\nBut I will highlight one section related to your argument as to why you think you deserve more compensation:\n\n>American will endeavor to carry you and your baggage with reasonable dispatch, but **times shown in timetables or elsewhere are not guaranteed and form no part of this contract.**\n\nI think the problem is you were stressed out during the ordeal (understandable) but that is leading to some extensive bias in how you view this. You seem to be under the impression that the airline/flight crew must have lied because you *believe* there was no aircraft on the runway in the first place. That may be true. The flight crew might have used that as an explanation for the go-around at first because they didn't want to worry passengers for what could have been a non-issue.\n\nWhen something indicates non-normal operations on an aircraft, flight crews typically have to go through reference materials and checklists to determine the full extent of any problem and if it presents a legitimate safety issue. Often times, checklists are run and the problem is resolved and the flight can proceed as normal with no need for alarm.\n\nIn this case, the crew clearly saw an indication there may have been a brakes issue. After running the checklists, the crew determined there was a possibility of an issue with the braking system upon landing and hence an emergency was declared."", 'I appreciate your response but I feel like everyone in this thread is celebrating mediocrity. Air travel is a competitive market and I am willing to bet other companies making that same flight on that same day did not have a situation that required its passengers to assume the brace position. I agree with you on your first point, seeing as there is no solid evidence a plane was on the run way however, I don,t believe the argument of shit happens just deal with it is a valid defense. It does not matter if the plane was broke before it took off or while we were in the air, the fact of the matter is that something unexpected clearly happened causing and emergency landing. American airlines thought it would be best to reach out to all passengers and attempt to rectify the situation with only a $140 flight voucher, not even enough to buy a ticket to any place I plan on visiting. It appear that everyone in this thread thinks I should just be happy because I landed safely and was only delayed 2.5 hour, A delay not caused by weather but by the company its self. At the end of the day something went wrong causing many passengers and my self to become stressed. American Airlines deemed it necessary to rectify the situation with a voucher that would require me to spend even more money with the company. If this is the statuesque and everyone else willing to settle for mediocrity, then air travel has a long way to go.    \n\nBest,\n\n-Alanm4a1 ', 'Thanks for the insight and shedding more light on the situation. ', 'Your logic is completely flawed, but if you want to try and get more than the $140, reach out to their customer service team and expect a canned response.\n\nAny other airline could have had the identical mechanical situation occur - and produced a number of different results. \n\nYou could have had to overnight at your connection airport rather than arrive a couple hours later.  You could have had a pilot who thought they were better than the machine and risked everyone\'s life.  You could have not received any voucher at all.  These things happen, and it sucks that it was your flight on that day, but this is all part of the .0001% risk that we all take when travelling.\n\nThis has nothing to do with ""settling for mediocrity"".  What is your expectation?  That they refund you completely for your flight and pay for PTSD therapy sessions for the next 5 years?\n\nYou can avoid flying AA for the rest of your life, but I guarantee that a similar situation could happen with United, Delta, etc. etc. and you aren\'t avoiding ""mediocrity"" in that decision.  ', 'Found your flight. Here are the facts:\n\n1. Your flight initiated a go-around at approximately 3:26 PM and landed on 4:07 PM. You were in the air for an additional 41 minutes while the flight crew sorted out the issue.\n\n2. Your flight also left 45 minutes late, for whatever reason. That also contributed to you missing your connection.\n\n3. There was no aircraft on the runway to cause the go-around. The flight crew reported a problem ""with the gear"" prior to the first landing attempt and told the tower they would need to go-around. If you were told the reason for the go-around was traffic on the runway, that was incorrect. Why you were told that and by who, I do not know. As I stated earlier, it could have been as simple as the flight crew not wanting to worry passengers if it was as simple as running checklists and landing normally.\n\n4. The frequency covering the time between the go-around and the landing is not covered on LiveATC.net so more information on the emergency is not easily available to the public.\n\n5. EDIT: The crew cancelled the emergency during the taxi to the gate stating it was ""just a bad indication.""', '\nSure, anything ""could"" happen, its the fact that it DID happen. IF any of those things you mentioned were to happen, then those airlines would be held accountable. \n\nThere is a certain level of risk with everything we do and I understand this risk, but that does not mean the company is completely alleviated of any responsibility  when something does go wrong. That is what insurance is for. Luckily we landed safely and ""nothing went wrong"".\n\nIt is easy to brush this off seeing as we landed safely. However for the last 10-15 minutes of the flight the pilot told us that the breaks are not working. I don\'t know how often you fly and if this situation has ever happened to you, but for those 10-15 minutes I, and the rest of the passenger aboard believed we did not have breaks to land with. American acknowledged this was an unexpected and unpleasant situation and is attempting to rectify it with a voucher.\n\nMy argument is this, A $140 voucher is not worth my time. I would rather have been on a plane without dealing with the stress of believing the airplane had no breaks than to be given a $140 voucher that essential does nothing for me. \n\nIt has nothing to do with avoiding mediocrity by switching to another airline, it has everything to do with people settling for it when the unexpected occurs. \n\nPs as explained to me by some of the people below I don\'t plan on filing a complaint or anything at the moment as they gave me some good insight on the situation. ', 'Thanks for all of this information, and without a doubt I have a limited knowledge of aircraft. It was a stress full situation which I would have paid $140 not to go through and that is why at the time of writing the original entry I did not feel it was adequate compensation.

7,What Airline out of these would you recommend most?,3,3ait97,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/3ait97/what_airline_out_of_these_would_you_recommend_most/,15,1434846922.0,"I'm not sure if this was the correct subreddit to post this on, but anyway, I'm planning on taking a trip to Miami, Florida the end of next week. The only reasonable flights are flying Frontier to and between Frontier, US Airways, and American Airlines flying back. I've only ever flown JetBlue before, and have only ever had good experiences with them.

My question is, basically, how are your experiences onboard with those airlines? Like, with JetBlue, you get free snack and beverages, and are also able to watch tv. Although, those things are not important to me, but they definitely make the trip more comfortable.

My friend(who is a huge enthusiast of anything aircraft and also works at an airport) recommended Delta over American. So basically, which airline/s out of the ones I've mentioned would you most recommend? I know it probably doesn't matter, but I figured I ask for everyone's opinion on which they prefer.","['Keep in mind that JetBlue is one of the better domestic airlines on the US, and to the best of my knowledge no other airline has personal TVs across their whole fleet, and when you do get a personal TV you usually need to pay to watch most content. However, I know that Delta offers a netflix-like service through their app if you connect via wifi with enough free content to keep you occupied. For this reason, in addition to the fact that in my experience service on Delta tends to be better than the other airlines you mentioned, listen to your friend and fly with them. Also, flying on one Airline both to and from Miami may help keep costs down. Out of curiosity, where are you flying from? ', ""You also aren't looking at FLL as a substitute? Thats where all the low cost carriers operate. MIA is a very expensive airport which keeps low cost carriers out and fares artificially high. FLL is 20 mi away."", ""Every experience I've had with US Airways has been an absolute nightmare. I can't say about the others. "", 'AA has terrible service generally - but for a short hop like this, just go with the airline that matches your time/value preferences the most. If JetBlue has provided you good service, why not stay there?\n\nAlso, remember: saving 20 bucks on airfare may seem like a great idea when you\'re home in front of your computer, but then suddenly you\'re stuck in a horrible seat with 28"" legroom, faced with all sorts of fees, greeted by surly flight attendants (again, AA), landing in some low-cost airport having to go hours on a bus to get to where you *really* wanted to go. Usually it pays off to choose when you\'d actually want to go and to which airport - and then take it from there. Most of us aren\'t better off in real life by flying ultra lowcost airlines at odd hours or to airports in the middle of nowhere.\n\n*May not be relevant to you, but maybe for others ...*\n\nIf you see more air travel in your near future, hopping into a loyalty program may direct your preference? \n\nRemember that alliances matter when choosing loyalty program. Delta is part of Skyteam, the worst of the big 3 alliances - AA is part of OneWorld, the best one IMHO. United is part of Star Alliance, the less bad one. \n\nIf you don\'t fly a lot and/or fly for work internationally, alliances don\'t matter. Delta should be reasonably good with its Medallion program.', ""I've only flown American and I've never had any problems... I think they are a great airline and knowing that Miami is one of their hubs it shouldn't be that expensive"", ""How about substituting MIA for FLL and flying Virgin America direct ? They keep getting rated the USA's top airline for overall experience. Might make the journey more enjoyable?"", ""You are flying economy. It doesn't matter."", 'Thanks for the helpful info. I would be flying from LGA in New York. I would have definitely chosen Delta, just I will only be staying at the most 4 days, and the price for a round trip is a bit more than what I wanted to spend.', ""I have been thinking of FLL as a substitute. With the cost I'd be saving with the ticket, I think that's the better way to go, considering I won't be staying long. Thanks for your help."", 'Really? Last time anyone checked there is a HUGE difference between the JetBlue/Virgin America side, and the Spirit/ domestic legacy products. \n\nThere is a quite a range of options in quality and price on domestic carrier economy products ', ""Ok, in that case it's best just to choose the lowest price. Keep in mind that because they are merging, service on US Airways and American will be essentially the same. On a long flight to Miami (say, from Seattle or L.A.), you may want to pay a little extra for better snacks, personal TVs, etc, but on the 1.5-2 hour flight from NYC it does't matter all that much IMO. In case you weren't aware, JetBlue flies into Ft Lauderdale, which is just a short train/cab ride from Miami. "", 'bah. it\'s domestic economy. what you call huge (or ""HUGE"") is an inch or two difference. it\'s all crap.', ""I agree with you on that for longer trips. I usually don't bother with the TVs anyways, and 1.5-2 hours go by fast. I actually flew to FLL with JetBlue last year and remember Miami being a short drive when I had looked it up. I actually did not think of taking the train to Miami until you mentioned it. I think I'd be better off taking a train and then a cab to my hotel. It would definitely cut my costs down since I am only staying a few days. Thank you for your help!"", ""Also Uber now. It's very cheap between FLL and MIA""]"

Is there a website where I can see what flights are flying on what days, regardless of ticket availability? (Somewhat like how I can look on Google and see what exact time a flight landed a week ago). the reason I ask this is because I'm not sure if that originally planned direct flight is still planning on flying that route or not.

Even if, in the terms and conditions, they can do anything they want with my flight (which seems ridiculous by the way - for example what if someone paid for Non-Stop and then they got changed months ahead to a 2 stopper even though they paid the much higher rate for the nonstop flight), what ground can I stand on to try to have them compensate for this..? 

I might try to have them put me on a flight 1 day earlier that is direct..

Is it possible for them to put me on a direct the same day with another airline? (Genuinely asking, if it's a stupid question, please be kind)..

13,An Open Letter to the CEO of Frontier Airlines,9,5jv6v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/5jv6v9/an_open_letter_to_the_ceo_of_frontier_airlines/,12,1482496010.0,"An open letter to Mr. Barry L. Biffle, CEO of Frontier Airlines.

Dear Mr. Biffle,
I thought you might be interested in knowing how well Frontier did this holiday season.

My family’s plan was straightforward.  I’m in the military, currently stationed in Australia, having served in Korea the year before.  I haven’t seen my family in 12 months, with the exception of two one-week windows during the summer.  Once when I was helping put my mother in hospice care, and again at her funeral.  This holiday season was the perfect time for a family vacation to Disney World.  My four year old is at the magic age where a hug from Tigger IS a hug from Tigger, and not a guy in a suit.  My daughter is a senior in High School, and this Christmas was going to be the golden time for one last family vacation before she pushed out into her adult life.  We even convinced my father to meet us down in Orlando, so he wouldn’t spend his first Christmas season alone.  When my daughter graduates, my family will join me in Australia, and trips to Disney, or even to visit my father, would be cost prohibitive.  This holiday season was supposed to be the time for me to have that family vacation where I could reconnect with my family.  We had a condo lined up for the week before Christmas at a beautiful resort (seven swimming pools!).  I flew in from Australia on the 15th, and would leave from Colorado Springs with my 17 year old and four year old on 17 December.  My wife and 13 year old son would join us on the 18th, since he was competing in the State of Colorado First Lego League Championships.  My father would fly down from Michigan on the 18th as well, staying at the same resort.  Maybe not the simplest, but a straightforward plan nonetheless.  Frontier Airlines seemed the perfect airlines to transport a family of five.  I wasn’t looking for frills, and I had never had a problem with them before.

There had been some weather overnight, and on the morning of the 17th, my wife checked your website to find the flight had been cancelled.  It seemed odd that it was cancelled so early, especially given other flights from other airlines didn’t seem to be cancelled.  But, the weather was bad, and I acknowledge weather can indeed have cascading effects on airlines.  Throughout that day, I spent a total of nine hours on hold.  You might be unaware of it, but the way your phone system is designed, it automatically disconnects when someone is on hold for four hours.  You might want to consider investing in one of those “call-back” systems, instead of subjecting people to four hours of Frontier propaganda on how great the airline is.  By the time I reached a customer service rep, I managed to get me and two of my kids booked for the 19th.  I’d also like to point out that I never received an email, or any notification the flight was cancelled.  In fact, your voice system was still tracking it as on time.  If my wife hadn’t decided to check the website, I wouldn’t have known until I arrived at the airport.  I was losing two days from my vacation, but I could live with that.  The worst part was telling my four year old we weren’t going to Disney that day.

The plan was manageable.  I called the condo and rental car company and let them know my wife wouldn’t be checking in until the 18th.  She and my son would meet my dad in Orlando.  They would spend the day shopping for food, getting Disney tickets, and preparing for me and my other two kids to arrive on the 19th  Not an ideal plan (I was paying for a night at the condo that wasn’t being used), but totally manageable.  As we loaded their bags into our van so I could drive them to the airport, my wife received an email saying the flight was cancelled.  This was a total shock.  No other airline was cancelling flights, and I had been checking the website all day; there was no indication it was cancelled until two hours and twenty minutes before the flight.  It was allegedly cancelled because of weather.  Yet no other airline was having weather issues.  Your plane makes an Orlando-Phoenix-Colorado Springs loop.  Weather at all three airports was clear.  I spend another three hours on hold, and finally get a customer service representative.  She tells me I can get a refund or reschedule the flight for the evening of the 23rd.  Which would give my wife and son a grand total of ONE day at Disney World before our flight back the morning of the 25th.  

The plan was expensive.  I got a refund, and managed to get two tickets via Delta for the morning of the 20th.  The tickets were a little out of my price range, but it was worth being together as a family.  I called the condo and told them to hold the room until the next night (again paying for a night that I wasn’t able to use).  I lost the rental car reservation, and am unsure whether I will be refunded the money I spent on the voucher.  My father was now alone in Orlando with no family.  I had just blown my budget for the vacation buying last minute tickets.  But we would be together as a family, and I wouldn’t have to tell my four year old we weren’t going to see Mickey.  It wasn’t an ideal plan, it had gotten very expensive, but in the end, everyone would be together and happy right?  I spent all day on the 19th checking not only my flight status, but the flight from Phoenix to Colorado Springs.  Both were on time for most of the day, but before I left for the airport, the website showed a 40 minute delay.  We pack our van up, load up me and two kids, and head to the airport.  We arrive at the airport, and check in.  The lady behind the counter says the flight is delayed, but when I ask if the plane is even in Phoenix, she says yes.  Having looked at the weather map, I know the weather between Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Orlando is good.  It looks like everything is on track!  My four year old is higher than a kite, almost impossible to control as he gets more and more excited about leaving.  He points out every plane through the window as we walk to our gate, absolutely sure that the plane he is pointing to is the plane that is going to take us to Mickey. As we get to the gate, a board notifies us that the flight will be delayed two hours.  I don’t understand why, since the plane is in Phoenix, and the weather is clear.  But ok.  Our bags are checked, every employee is saying we are going to be taking off.  I settle in, and work on occupying a hyperactive four year old.  Then all hell breaks loose.

The plan was a Cluster*#@!.  It started as a rumor, and quickly spread.  The flight had been cancelled.  No Frontier employees were around, but everyone pulls out their phone and checks the website, sure enough it reads cancelled.  People begin to call Frontier (interestingly enough, most people had that number handy).  No employees at the gate.  Zero.  Zilch.  People begin to line up.  As I go to get into line, my four year old begins to cry as he realizes he isn’t getting on the plane.  After about twenty minutes, three Frontier employees march up to the podium, and have the audacity to tell us the weather had caused the flight to be cancelled.  What?  For three days in a row, Frontier had cancelled a flight because of “weather.”  When it was pointed out that the weather wasn’t bad in any of the three locations, the employee stated that it was because the weather had prevented a rested crew from getting to Phoenix.  What?  The flight hadn’t flown for three days and you didn’t have a rested crew?  You couldn’t get a rested crew to the correct location?  This rings as untrue and disingenuous (heck, use a different airline and fly a crew to Phoenix).  It gets better.  Your employees state they weren’t even going to try to rebook.  You could either get a refund or call the toll-free number to try to rebook (but nothing was available until after Christmas).  And because the cancellation was caused by “weather,” no vouchers for hotels or flights would be given.  Apparently Frontier is effected differently by the weather than other (more reputable) airlines are.  So to sum up so far, I’ve paid for three nights on a condo that I haven’t used.  Lost a rental car reservation.  My recently widowed father is alone in Orlando.  I have two tickets to Orlando on Delta schedule to fly out on the 20th, but three members of my family with no tickets.

As I type this, my wife is trying to enjoy Disney World with my father, and our four year old (at $1300 for last minute ticket, I couldn’t afford for my whole family to fly).  From the pictures I’ve been sent, his smile is something to make the meanest villain smile and remember fond childhood memories.  For the last six months, I was looking forward to being with my family (and seeing that smile in person), and having one last family vacation.  Now I sit with my two teenagers binge watching TV (I should have never given the 17 year old the control of the remote), and missing out on the joys of my family being together.  Your airline absolutely ruined one of the (if not the) last family vacations I will have before my daughter leaves the house.  After 18 months away from my four year old, I missed an opportunity to bond with him, and a chance for him to be with his father on the happiest place on earth.  Your airlines brought stress, unanticipated expenses, and ultimately unhappiness to my family.  To be succinct, your airline sucks the joy out of life and turns the tolerable experience of flying into a living nightmare.

So why do I write to you.  Well for a few reasons.  One part of me wishes that investors see this, and realize what a sinking ship your company is.  This will in-turn prevent you from taking the company public, and as word of your crappy and unreliable service spreads, the private owners of the company will take a shellacking while the company goes belly-up.  Another part of me wishes that you realize how horribly your company is doing, and in a public relations stunt, you provide an all-expenses paid trip reuniting me and my family in Disney World.  Both unlikely, so instead, allow me to provide you some pointed feedback you need to make if you want your company to survive this fiasco.
•	Remember that travelers value reliability above comfort and price.  It’s great to only pay for what I want to use, but if you can’t guarantee that you’ll have me in the right place at the right time, then your airline is useless to me.  Yours was the only airline effected so drastically by the weather.  Most airlines had righted their ship within 6 hours of the storms.  Yours took longer than 72 hours, and still left people stranded.  You need to build up redundancy in your airline to anticipate weather/maintenance/mismanagement.  It might cost you more in operating expenses, but in the long run, you will keep customers coming back.  All the last 96 hours did was create thousands of people who will never fly Frontier again (and their families).  Ryanair, the epitome of no frills and cheap, is, at its core, reliable.

•	Have transparency when talking to your clients.  We are not idiots.  I know no other airline was affected by weather.  I know the weather at the three cities in question was flyable.  I know planes can travel over and around bad weather between cities.  Don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining.  If the other rumors that this was really caused by a sick-out/strike are true, then you need to tell people that.  If an employee said “hey, we can rebook you, but we think there is a sick-out going on, it’s up to you,” then I can make the choice if I want to risk it.  Instead you strung me along for three days, each day costing me more money.

•	Own your mistakes.  Weather may have provided the first wrinkle, but let’s be honest, your employees mismanaged planes and crews.  And you need to own that mistake.  And then you need to throw free stuff at people.  If you refunded my $1000 in tickets and gave me a $2000 voucher to use over the next two years, do you think I would be bitching right now?  No.  I would be telling people that Frontier had some major problems, but they went out of their way to try and make things right.  Instead I’m telling people I will never fly Frontier again, and they ruined my last chance at a family vacation after being apart from them for a year.  Oh, and since we both know it wasn’t weather, then there wouldn’t have been countless hours by your clients and employees rebooking flights that weren’t really going to take off.

•	Invest in some customer service infrastructure.  I spent over 12 hours on hold over a 48 hour period.  Hire another call center.  Or update your system to allow call-backs so I don’t have to wait with my ear to the phone.  If you do choose to ignore any of my advice, please at least change your on-hold message.  Plug in a radio station or comedy channel or something.  But for the love of god, recognize that four hours of your propaganda is cruel and unusual.


Mr. Biffle, your mistake was cutting so many costs that you couldn’t handle a simple (and expected) down turn in weather.  Whether it was lack of redundancy, mismanagement of resources, or alienated pilots, you’ve cut too many corners to try and stay cheap.  If you aren’t viewing the events of 17-19 December as an existential crisis of your airlines, then you are misreading the American public, and our tolerance for incompetence with high value items.  You are about to make Frontier the Schlitz Beer of the airline industry, destined to be a case study to MBA students on how to turn a viable company into a footnote.  I saw the lines at the counter and endured the hold time, there is a demand for your services, but people will never demand crappy service for hundreds of dollars, and that, sir, is what you are currently providing.

15,UNITED AIRLINES,0,6559pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/6559pg/united_airlines/,12,1492116795.0,"#United #Unitedairlines Seeing that the mainstream media has deluded most of the social media populace, I decided to leave my comments as a person possessing insider information.

Neoliberalism has always been integrated in the bedrock of American society, postmodern or premodern. In any capitalist society, big multinational corporations will always have the final say.

In defense of UA's bumping procedure:
In this case, the passenger dragged down the aircraft refused to comply with the company's terms and conditions. An overseated flight will always result in the bumping procedure if the incentives for vouchers and free accommodation does not offload the adequate number of passengers needed for the staff to be seated, or if no one volunteers to get offboard. An overbooked flight means that passengers will even get to sit on the jump seats (crew seats). If an inadequate number of crew does not go aboard the flight, an immense amount of pressure will be placed upon the crew, rendering the service to be less efficient and degrading quality. 
So, the bumping procedure had to be initiated that flight. Three Caucasians and one Asian were chosen by the computer system to be offloaded. Here's how the algorithm works: Staff-travelers (staffs who are using company privileges to travel at a lower price) will be considered to be offloaded first. Next, the discounted ticket travelers. Then, normal economy class travelers. Then, business class travelers (RARELY), etc. As I suppose you should understand it now:
Lower priority (paid less) travelers will be bumped first. YOU PAY LESS, YOU HAVE LESSER PASSENGER RIGHTS. (The first rule of capitalism for major travelling companies, and they abide to this business model.)
THERE WAS NO RACISM.

Justifications of the incident, pro-passenger and pro-company:
Social media news outlets did not go behind the scenes, and spread disinformation. Let's do a fact-check, shall we?
1. 4 passengers chosen by RANDOM?
No. Algorithms for business. (See last paragraph)

2. ONLY United Airlines bump passengers.
No. Major airlines do so as part of their marketing technique. Air Canada, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, etc. do so.

3. BLATANT RACISM BIGOTRY!
...And the race card has to be pulled by far-left social justice warriors. United Airlines as an airline company has employed most diverse races as employees, and has treated them all fairly, regardless of race. There are Asian employees who like the company because the CEO hates racism and treats them fairly, having no wage and privilege gap between nationalities. Wake up. It’s a globalized company.

4. Achieving the middle ground:
The video footage is incomplete, as it only showed the man being dragged out. What happened before was that the man was asked by airport police/security to be bumped, which he refused to comply, therefore committing a federal offense according American law (breaking a major homeland security law), and was being disruptive to the peaceful atmosphere by waving his fists. Therefore, the security had to forcefully drag him out. He was acting in a passive-aggressive manner for the public to sympathize with him.
Who's to blame? (NOT in an order of importance)
1. The ground staff
The bumping procedure should start before the passengers are seated: the fault lies at the ground staff, as they should notify the cabin crew beforehand, before the flight has boarded passengers.

2. The airport security officer
The officer wasn't a UA employee. Then, police brutality in the US. 'Nuff explained. Always happens lol

3. The passenger
Before buying the ticket he should read the rules of the airline, that the bumping procedure would be initiated if necessary. He refused to cooperate with staff and exacerbated the situation by throwing a tantrum, and hurt himself during the process.

As the incident has sparked outrage and distress in the public mainly due to the brutality, the biggest fault perhaps lies at the POLICE OFFICER. However, the public only cares about what triggered it (UA offloading passengers), and the misconception of the security being a part of their airline company, so they blame the company, despite the company never stated to ‘beat the customer until he abides’. United did not break any law, and he agreed to the policy and possibility of involuntary bump when he bought his ticket. They followed protocol as required by law. Once law enforcement became involved (also as required by federal protocol), United stepped out of the decision-making process. They had nothing to do with the rest. The passenger was forcibly removed by federal aviation security (the disturbing clip that everyone is talking about) after running back into the secured area after being escorted out once. Once he did that, like it or not, they (law enforcement) were under full discretion of the law to apply necessary force to remove the threat. I’m not saying it’s pretty, but the only one who actually broke a law was the passenger. 

A little fact:
UA stocks have only dropped 1%. 1 billion was lost yesterday, but today it had risen 800 million, therefore compensating the 2% yesterday.

The moral of the story is that when you take advantage of the service the airport provides, you play by their rules.

To the people who wants to boycott or/and wishes UA to be bankrupt due to this incident: You are deluded by social media. Think twice before jumping to conclusions and doing something irrational. ","[""I don't really have a dog in this fight but I think you're conflating what is legal with what is moral.  I think Dr. Dao behaved the way a reasonable person might behave in that situation.

We would love to put it towards a vacation, but the trouble is, American Airlines is so ridiculously overpriced, we simply cannot justify it. For example: we want to plan a small getaway to San Francisco. A non-stop, round-trip ticket from Long Beach to San Fran on Jet Blue is $80. On American Airlines, it's $300-$500, or $200 leaving from LAX, for a 5 hour flight with one stop! How could we possibly justify buying those tickets? We've looked up countless destinations, and it's always the same problem: the prices are 2x, sometimes 3x, the price of other airlines!

The flight started off smooth until we slowly descended to NRT airport around 3:45 PM the next day. The plane circled NRT airport over 3 times before the pilot made the decision to land at Nagoya's airport, a 4 hour drive. There were plenty of nearby airport such as Haneda aiport. The pilot stated that the plane needed to refuel at Nagoya's airport. By then, it was around 6pm. We were kept on the plane for the next 5 hours until 10:00 PM. A flight attendant informed us that due to heavy wind, the plane could not land at Narita and thus we had to stay at Nagoya overnight and catch the first train out to Tokyo the next day. With that said, there was no meal or overnight compensation. They simply gave us a reimbursement form for $140 USD. Mind you, the bullet train from Nagoya to Tokyo is already $150 USD. My girlfriend and I slept at Nagoya's airport and consequently, missed our hotel for that night. 

I both tweeted and contacted American Airlines but they simply refused to compensate me for my hotel and inconvenience. If we had been let go earlier, we could have caught the last train out from Nagoya airport to Tokyo. Why were we kept on the plane for the next 5+ hours?

Expecting airlines to compensate everyone for it would bankrupt airlines overnight and then you could enjoy taking a ship across the pacific instead. \n\nDespite all our modern technology, nature is still much more powerful and can be really difficult to deal with.

Due to having such high fixed costs, raising prices would naturally be the solution to solve many of the airlines’ problems, but consumer power and competition in the U.S. is strong, so it would be impressive if any airlines could pull it off. \n\nAs for airports, almost all airports are government-run, and apart from smaller, regional airports, rely on revenue generated exclusively through the airport, restricting how much they can make. This is why many of the airports, built many decades ago to handle a smaller capacity, have a hard time growing more capacity or remodelling to keep up with the times.', 'The airlines will tell you that adjusted for inflation, airline fares are cheaper than they\'ve ever been. Even once you add in all the ""hidden"" fees, it\'s still cheaper to fly across the country today than it was 60 years ago. And they\'re not wrong.\n\nBut understand what that means: an airline will safely get you from point A to point B, in less time, for less money than the same trip at any other point in history.\n\nThey\'ve done this by stripping extras like comfy seats (all that padding adds weight, and weight adds fuel requirements, and fuel costs money), free in-flight meals (cost to prepare, store, and serve, plus liability for food poisoning), and free booze ($$$). So the flight you paid a fortune for in the 1950s included a lot of amenities, but it also cost more. A LOT more.\n\nThe thing is, you can still get that class of service today by paying extra. You can get priority boarding, free food, free booze, and slightly more comfortable seats by flying premium economy. You\'re still going to pay less than you would half a century ago, and you\'re going to have a MUCH lower chance of dying (compare aviation fatality rates in the 1970s vs the 2010s), and you\'re going to get better in-flight entertainment.\n\nAs for airport food, it\'s price gouging, plain and simple. They charge that because people pay it. Want to fight back? Eat before and after the airport.', ""I know that's an exaggeration, but I still don't understand how this happens in the US. I've been told that is because the country has a very extensive territory. In South America we don't really have that much trouble when flying."", ""I read the article.\n\nStill have questions though.\n\nAirlines are 'government run'... meaning they receive governem funding? \n\nSo we have the problem. They aren't very profitable, but they're an important tool of society. So important they are always reacting and cant proactively solve problems or improve.\n\nThis makes sense as to why they are stuck.\n\nSo how is this problem addressed? We, as a society, cant keep businesses that produce superfluous or made-to-break products forever. \n\nWe need things like air travel, but as they are only essential but not profitable... they have to remain in a trash state? \n\nIt would seem that government involvement in businesses which are essential to society may be a good thing?\n\nHow do problems like this actually get fixed?"", ""No? \n\nAny food you buy in an airport isn't 5x the regular price? \n\nSeats aren't crammed and force your neck and back Into poor positions? \n\nProcess won't change from $60 - $140 the next day event though half the seats are empty? \n\nIt sounds like a dream."", ""Airport food isn't any more outrageous than stadiums, concerts, basically, any venue where there is no competition and they know you don't have many alternatives.\n\nI fly Southwest and the seats are fine, even for 5-hour transcontinental trips.""]"

26,Terrible experience on American Airlines due to flight diversion,1,7bu696,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7bu696/terrible_experience_on_american_airlines_due_to/,8,1510271804.0,"Hi guys, just had most horrendous experience with American Airlines. Had A flight from DFW to SAN supposed to leave at 10:20 PM. Flight was delayed due to delay on Flight attendants arriving on another flight. Right before departure at 11:30 PM they announced that due to a curfew at San Diego the flight will be diverted to LAX and all pssgrs will be bused from LAX to San Diego.

Didn’t arrive at San Diego until 4:15 AM , About five hours past the original arrival time.

The question is do I have any chance of getting compensation for this terrible experience? ","[""There is no compensation for something like this, it's just a risk for end of day flights. \n\nA weather delay likely hours before caused cascading delays for every flight the aircraft and/or crew were on before, and it cost the airline a lot of money to get you to your destination, late or not. Pretty much guaranteed AA lost money on that flight, if not others that day. \n\nCurfews are what they are, no airline can get around them, and for many passengers, it's probably better getting home super late than being stuck in Dallas with no hotel room waiting for the San Diego airport to open again. \n\nI'm sorry you had to go through it, wouldn't wish that on anyone, but it's just one of the things we still have to deal with in the age of taken-for-granted air travel. "", 'Normally the San Diego curfew allows arrivals any time, but prohibits departures between midnight and 6:30am. However the airport is currently in the middle of resurfacing the runway (there is only one so they just do a little bit each night) so that means no arrivals either.', 'https://thepointsguy.com/2016/08/how-to-get-compensation-flight-issues/\n\nhttps://www.simplemost.com/airlines-compensate-delayed-canceled-flights/\n\nAnd for academic purposes, https://www.simplemost.com/airlines-compensate-delayed-canceled-flights/\n\nThe rule is ""you never know until you ask"". By your description, the delay was not caused by a force of nature, a third party that AA didn\'t have control of, or any other excusable reason. They failed to provide a crew, which would be their fault in any case, and the fact that it happened in their largest hub city where they probably have thousands of crew members living should make it doubly frustrating. \n\nStick to the advice in the articles above and you just might have some luck and your email will land on the screen of someone in a good mood, and they might send you a voucher. Maybe add that last time you were delayed on Delta they provided compensation, because they seem to have a policy on that that AA may not. Don\'t get too frustrated if it doesn\'t work out, it is not worth the energy.\n\nI mostly agree with /u/agha0013 but I think he let\'s the airlines off too easy on their end of the culpability.\n\nYes, there are cascading weather delays, but there are literally infinite approaches to address that challenge and this specific scenario. Some examples would be (1) building resilience against cascading delays into the schedules, (2) paying off-duty or over-time flight attendants a premium to work extra that month (all the airlines have such clauses in their contracts), or (3) shuttling the passengers in small planes for a final leg into a local GA airport in San Diego so that you didn\'t have to bus from LAX. \n\nAs you see in that third article I linked, the European Union actually does have delayed flight compensation rules, including the provision of food, drink, and entertainment, for all delays over 2 hours, and the provision of cash compensation for all delays over 3 hours. People will argue that such rules would make tickets more expensive, and I agree, however there is no denying that air travel is cheaper in Europe than in the US, so even after factoring in that additional protection for passengers, they get lower prices. Why? Because the Europeans do a much better job of regulating towards competition. But that\'s a debate for another thread.', ""I'd ask and they'll probably throw some miles your way but you aren't owed anything.\n\nRemember, the airline is probably even more inconvenienced than you. Now they have to get a crew that was supposed to be in San Diego to LA and then move an expensive airplane down to the right airport before flying out again which will mean they are starting with a delay that costs them money."", 'Very well put. ', 'How long will the construction take?', 'Ok, so something to consider here in your analysis of the possible irregular operations solutions. Lets start with the aircraft schedule. airlines fly the plane so many hours a day with precisely scheduled turn times on the gates. With this they have to take into account of where the aircraft starts the day and where it ends the day. Sometimes they need to be routed to different cities for maintenance. In the airline schedule there has to be balance. By AAL canceling the LAX-SAN leg, they now have an aircraft out of position to start the SAN service in the morning on one line of flying, and they have an extra aircraft in LAX. The easiest solution would be to cancel a SAN-LAX flight to balance the schedule. \nThe crew problem faces another issue. You cant rush a crew to get to the airport and get going due to the safety nature of the work. There is usually a bidding process for crews to pick up trips so work is fairly distributed as well as a time to report which is 2 hours in the earliest cases I have seen. So a new crew solution is really a only viable if you have at least 4 hours notice of the pending issue. airlines do have reserve crews, but they are usually used up by the evening. Sometimes they are assigned to other assignments to fix issues. The big issue is that Reserves sit on duty most of the day in a reserve availability period and they have to be assigned a trip that falls within that period. They could take a flight attendant crew off of another inbound flight that has longer scheduled ground time at LAX, and pull them from their later assignment. This defers the problem later and buys an opportunity for more time to find a complete solution. \n\nAt the heart of this issue is the geography. The most traveled corridor in the US is the Northern CA and Southern CA markets. With SFO having more ATC ground delay programs than any US airport this year, these programs propagate delay to all flights arriving in SFO, as well as the following flights for the rest of the day on each on of those aircraft. \n\nI do agree that the Europeans have an efficient system and nice incentives to keep airlines on time there. One benefit is that average flight segments are significantly shorter than those in the US. This is relevant because European destinations have higher densities of populations located closer together. This has been a driving factor for large rail infrastructure. While in one view point this causes a lower demand for air travel, but its also an advantage for airlines as well. Imagine if the US had a similar railroad infrastructure to Europe. It would then be possible for AAL to work with a rail partner to move you to BUR, SNA, LGB, ONT, or SBA which might have a flight to SAN which could have gotten you to your destination if not taking rail to your destination. \n\nSo to conclude, each airline network is unique. Having spare aircraft, crews sitting around waiting for something to happen all cost significant amounts of money. These are factors that affect ticket prices and having too little productivity could actually cause an airline to be unable to compete in the market. not all flights make a profit, and some are priced at losses just to keep market share (See DFW ticket price history when restrictions were lifted for Southwest at Love field). Profitable flights vary depending on a lot of factors of delay and weather. Typical industry target is an 8% profit margin. This builds large numbers when airlines operate thousands of flights a day.  \n', 'The project is scheduled to run through October 2018 (it started this month), but I don\'t know if the overnight closures will be required through that date.\n\n> She reported that the Airport Authority received an Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grant award for nearly $16.77 million from the FAA for rehabilitation of the runway.

27,Never flying American Airlines again,3,3018fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/3018fb/never_flying_american_airlines_again/,8,1427161376.0,"Never flying American Airlines again. This is an epic read so the TL;DR version is that they were extremely rude and condescending to a non-white, ESL couple and threatened to call police because I was upset about it.

First, the gate agent called Groups 1 and 2. An older Asian couple who are in Group 3 goes when all of 2 is finished but they haven't been called yet.

Gate agent: You're in the WROOOOOONG group. Don't you understand? I said 1 (holds up finger) and 2 (holds up two fingers). You're in 3 (holds up three fingers) and points to their ticket where it says ""Group 3"".

Then she announces to everyone ""If you're in groups 3 and 4, then you have to check your rollaways. All the overhead storage is full. You will not get on this flight if you do not check your baggage.""

She then pushes the older couple to the side where the American Airlines desk agent is and they confer with each other in Chinese and then tell the desk agent that they don't want to check their luggage because they have valuables.

Desk agent: You don't understand. You. (Points to the couple). Have. To. Check. (Waves baggage tag around). Your. (Points to them again). Luggage. (Waves his hands around their carryon). 
Woman: (In perfectly good English) Yes, we understand you but I'm saying that I don't want to. 
Desk agent: Nooooo. The plane. (Spreads his arms out wide and mimics a plane). Is. Fuuuuuull. 
Woman: I want to carry my bag. 
Desk agent: Your luggage. (Waves arms above luggage). Will go under. (Gestures something going under). The plane. (Points towards the breezeway). You can take whatever you need out of your bag. (Waves arms over luggage).

So he forces them to open their luggage on the floor in front of everyone waiting to get on the plane, dig through their personal belongings and pull out valuables to carry by hand.

Then my crew gets up in line and we tell them that we have company property that we cannot let out of our possession. Hence the reason why WE PAY (they charge for each bag) to check our personal stuff and carry our company laptops, hard drives, official scores, etc. They tell us that it's not their problem and we need to take out all valuables and bring them on board with us so they can check the rollaways.

I say, ""Fine. Tag it."" And kick my bag towards them (it's on wheels so it rolls towards the desk) and nudges the older woman who is still on the floor going through her stuff. I apologize to the woman and ask if she's ok and she's so angry with them and tells me that they can't talk to her and her husband like that.

The gate agent: ""Ma'am, if you don't calm down, I'm going to call airport security"".

I'm still talking to the woman and the agent says, ""If you don't stop talking to her, I'm going to call security. STOP. TALKING. TO. HER!""

I turn to her and say, ""And tell them what?""

Meanwhile, B and Sean are going through our company cases and pulling out the sensitive equipment.

Gate agent: Ma'am, I will call the STATE police. 
Me (to Sean on the floor): Did you hear that Sean? She's calling the STATE police. 
Sean: Yeah, I heard. 
Gate agent: I can deny you boarding.
Me (to Sean): Hey Sean, she's gonna deny us boarding. 
Sean: Yep, I knooooow.

She's making threats to us even though we're clearly cooperating and trying to pick out what's most important in the bag.

I get my receipt for my luggage and the older woman tells the desk agent that she didn't get one. He says, ""Yeah, I handed it to you. It's probably under all your stuff."" You know, the stuff that she now has to carry in her arms.

I told him that he should print her out another one so she can get on with her trip. And he tells her, ""I. (Points to himself). Gave it to. (Gestures handing something over). Yoooooou. (Points to her)."" I tell him that he doesn't need to treat her like that and the gate agent pretty much tells me to get on the plane (in other words, mind my own business).

The woman asks for the desk agent for his name. He gives her his first name. And she presses, ""And your last name?"" And you know what he does? HE GIVES HER THE WRONG LAST NAME. He said ""Shapiro"" when his ID badge says ""Dassow"" (or something similar to that). I only know cause I made him to turn his lanyard around.

So now my crew and I are carrying our laptops, hard drives, iPods and the cash (including pouches of heavy change) we fundraised for our non-profit which pays for children's cancer treatments in our arms on the ride from Hartford, CT to Los Angeles, CA. Oh and there was plenty of overhead storage space when we boarded.

This also isn't the first time something like this has happened to me with American Airlines. Years and years ago, I was sitting in the exit row and standard procedure is that the flight attendants ask you if you are willing and able to help out in an emergency. When we were asked this, we all said ""yes"" but then she looks at me and says, ""You have to be able to follow instructions given in English."" And then leans over to ask, ""Do yoooou understand English?""

39,"Banked hub-and-spoke vs. unbanked point-to-point has any airline ever attempted a ""hybrid"" model that combines huge banks with lots of connectivity with lots of unbanked point-to-point service in between to maximize resources utilization?",13,994z9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/994z9o/banked_hubandspoke_vs_unbanked_pointtopoint_has/,6,1534900105.0,"My understanding of the narrative of airline economics goes something like this: back in the days of airline regulation in the US and Europe, what are now called ""legacy airlines"" chose to opt for a hub-and-spoke model over point-to-point service. The hub and spoke model combined with ""banks"" of flights where flights would all arrive and depart within a short time span allowed them to connect people in hundreds of cities to each other with a single quick connection. This was very attractive to customers that wanted to fly out of medium and small airports because it allowed them to get pretty much anywhere with a single quick stop. However, it also was inefficient: firstly because nonstop flights use less fuel, maintenance, and crew time than a connecting flight that has to fly somewhat out of the way to the hub airport and then take off for a second time, and secondly because scheduling for the hub banks meant that airplanes spent a lot of time on the ground doing nothing as they wait to take off so that they will land in time for the bank, and then wait at the bank during the inflated turnaround time as thousands of people are switching flights simultaneously.

Enter deregulation and the rise of low-cost carriers, new airlines started focusing on nonstop flights between city pairs with enough demand to justify them. Additionally, rather than arriving and departing in banks, they would simply turn each of their planes around as quickly as possible, to maximize their utilization. These changes to the flight model meant that the low cost airlines could fly people at significantly lower CASM with the same airplanes and same airplane capacity, since their planes were flying more nonstop routes and were flying more hours per day.

The response from the legacy carriers as far as I can see in the US has been to shift to a model with a greater number of smaller banks. Rather than having a fewer but larger banks, the legacy airlines are basically running banks nonstop at their hub airports: as soon as the last flight has departed from the first bank, the first flight is scheduled to land from the second bank, and so on all day and night just going from bank to bank. Some banks are bigger than others but they are running all day. The benefit is that with more banks, it is easier to schedule the airplanes to get higher utilization. Airplanes aren't sitting on the ground waiting for bank timing as much simply because there are more banks. Also, for major destinations and airports that have the demand to justify many flights per day, you can offer a flight with every bank, giving customers better choice of flight timing.

However I would think that there is a major downside to having so many banks in the form of decreased bank connectivity. If each bank has flights from fewer cities, you are connecting fewer cities with a single quick connection. For example, say you are talking about a smaller airport in rural oregon and flights to ORD. If American Airlines only ran 2-4 huge banks each day at Ohare, instead of running 6-8 smaller banks, with each bank they would be able to justify a flight to that small oregon airport. In contrast, with a higher number of smaller banks, in no single bank would they be able to aggregate enough customers trying to fly to that oregon airport, so they wouldn't be able to justify the flight. Or maybe they would be able to justify the flight once per day, but that one smaller bank that it flew from wouldn't have incoming flights from as many cities, so people from fewer cities would be able to connect onto that flight to oregon. They would have to fly into the previous bank and have a 3.5 hour layover at ORD, or would have to connect somewhere else such as at DFW in order to get on a flight that would arrive at ORD in time for the Oregon flight.

So to me it seems like the constant ""rolling banks"" are perhaps ""the worst of both worlds"": they neither achieve the efficiency of low cost carriers nor the connectivity of traditional large hub and spoke banks.

So my question is, have any airline ever attempted a model that would combine both large banks for their connectivity to smaller airports, with point-to-point service for its higher efficiency and utilization?

To continue my example, say that American Airlines would run 2-4 large banks per day at ORD, and then the rest of the day would operate point-to-point service. Since they would have so much point-to-point service across their whole nationwide network, it would be trivial for them to schedule airplanes to arrive at the banks efficiently. If a plane lands at an airport at a time when it is not convenient to immediately turn around and leave for a bank, then they would simply take off for a point-to-point flight. Schedules would be crafted so that lots of point-to-point flights would be able to turn around and immediately fly into a bank for utilization efficiency. There would still be the extra cost of waiting at the bank for the inflated turnaround time, but that's a small cost relative to the benefits of large bank connectivity where people from 100 cities could be simultaneously flying into ORD to take off for another 100 cities.

To my best ability to guess, I would think that such a flight model would be able to achieve nearly the utilization of low cost carriers while also recouping the connectivity benefits of large hub and spoke banks. The only downside would be flight frequency between city pairs that don't have the demand to justify nonstop flights but who do have enough demand to justify connecting flights at even smaller banks. With fewer banks, there might have fewer flights available each day, many price insensitive travelers are willing to pay more to fly at their preferred times, so this is a downside for airlines. But that wouldn't even necessarily be the case, since each larger bank would be able to service more destinations. For example, again take that small Oregon airport, and say that the status quo with rolling small banks is that American Airlines only flies to that airport from their Phoenix hub. If you had fewer larger banks, maybe American Airlines would fly there not only from Phoenix, but from LAX, DFW, and ORD as well, and in total across all these hubs they could support the same amount of daily flights into the small Oregon airport. The difference would only be that since each of the flights was flying from a larger bank, travelers from more cities would have an opportunity to make the quick 1 stop connection.

TL;DR: What if American Airlines purchased a low cost carrier like Southwest Airlines and continued to fly all of Southwest's point-to-point routes, but also routed some of those planes to fly into their hubs when the schedules were conducive, to produce larger hub banks without the downside of decreased aircraft and crew utilization, to achieve the best of best worlds: nearly maximum aircraft and crew utilization from quick aircraft turnarounds combined with the 1 stop connectivity of large hub banks.","['I don’t really have an answer for you, not an expert in network, but that’s a really interesting and well thought out question. Unfortunately this sub gets very little traffic so you’re unlikely to have much of a conversation here. You could maybe try posting in r/aviation, there’s a bit more activity there but that’s more about actual flying than airline economics.', 'Great question: Take a look at AF in CDG: basically a waved structure to feed the long-haul, superimposed unto a non-connecting structure to serve the domestic market. TK in IST tried something similar a while back (2015-16, IIRC), but never to AF’s extent. Good luck exploring the topic. ', 'Wow a real post not “can I get a refund on my Atlanta to Memphis that was 100$ and I flew half of” :-) thanks!', ""I don't know if a US airline has ever attempted this, but there have been LCC ventures by major airlines that you may be interested in researching (Delta/Song, United/Ted).\n\nMy thought is that with the use of regional jets most small-medium cities are able to achieve high hub connectivity/high frequency that wouldn't be economical on mainline jets. It's the question of frequency vs volume, and as you mention higher frequency can come at the cost of higher CASM. By utilizing regional jets CASM is kept in line even at higher frequency.\n\nRunning fewer banks/flying point to point more is an interesting idea, but the airlines don't exist in a vacuum. For each point to point flight United runs from PDX-PHX American is running the same flight at a lower cost due to their PHX hub. Hubs are highly measured by not only their connecting traffic, but also their O&D. For passengers living in a hub market they essentially have point to point service at a high frequency.\n\nAs far as the downside of connecting fewer cities in each bank that would technically be possible I think it's somewhat insignificant. If a market can't sustain a flight to the hub in each bank that means there isn't a huge impact to the number of customers potentially not being serviced as efficiently as they could be. The connection time should still be short for most customers, as most customers will be traveling to another major airport that is serviced by each bank. But you're right that someone going from PIA-BTV may have an extended connection if each city pair isn't served in each bank. With that being said, there would have to be a cost analysis of whether the O&D revenue in that market is worth the cost of running a point to point flight. There would also be operational considerations of more aircraft spending more time at non-mtx locations. "", ""You're missing one key element for banks in the US, which is the smaller but more frequent banks are clustered by directionality and are reducing circuity as spokes have redundant hub access.\n\nAlso, the major efficiencies of an LCC aren't always in fleet utilization, it's mostly ownership and labor agreements that reset the clock - airlines get more expensive as they age."", 'Great points. Yes part of this idea actually came to me partly from thinking about new legacy airline low cost ventures, not the US-based ones you mentioned that have already been shuttered, but rather a recent spate of news about major Asian legacy carriers launching their own LCC brands.\n\nI wondered, ""why are they creating separate LCC brands after that business plan failed in America, why aren\'t they just introducing \'Economy Basic\' type tickets to their normal economy class?"" Then I thought about how cabin quality and included amenities is just a small part of the difference between LCC and legacy operators, and that the biggest difference economically is probably around scheduling and banking... but then I still couldn\'t wrap my head around why they didn\'t just fly more flights under their legacy brand rather than create a separate brand. If they were already at max airport capacity during their banks, then just run the additional flights at off-bank times.\n\nRegarding regional jets, as you probably already know, they are only able to achieve viable economics by ""cheating"". In terms of their fundamental costs, how much fuel they consume, how much maintenance, how many crew members they require per passenger, they have much higher CASM than mainline airliners. They are able to operate because the industry has carved out regulatory and labor exceptions that allow them to hire inexperienced crews at McDonalds-level wages and to have their maintenance conducted by shadetree mechanics. Still they exist, and so fewer larger banks would see some of the regional jets on routes that already exist replaced by mainline jets, and would see some new thin routes that didn\'t exist before at all serviced by regional jets.\n\nThere have been constant complaints about the legacy airlines no longer servicing very small airports that previously provided feeder service to legacy hubs, and the excuses have included the operating costs of the smaller airplanes, slot availability at hubs, and competition from LCCs. One thing that never gets mentioned that I think is a factor as well is this switch to more smaller banks. If you live 30 minutes away from one of these tiny airports that relies on once daily service by a ~70 seater, you might fly into a hub and can\'t connect to your destination at that bank, so you have to wait for one of the next couple banks, or have to connect a second time somewhere else. By the time you sit through your 6 hour layover or make that extra connecting flight, you may as well have just driven 4 hours from your house to the nearest larger airport. Fewer larger banks would definitely increase the viability of these smallest of airports, allowing you to connect in one stop to many destinations without having to sit through extended connections.']"

No extra leg room, same size seat, same pitch, same everything. But because it's an aisle seat it they are charging $64.25 more for it. Not $20, $30, but $64. AND they don't tell you when you book your flight that they will be charging you all these extra fees. When will they start making you pay for the air you breathe on their planes?","[""Just like at a sporting event - location matters. The same size seat with the same legroom in a prime location is going to be more expensive than a nosebleed or middle seat. Some travelers are willing to pay a premium to be seated on the aisle or near the front of the plane. The airline is just capitalizing on this. American is certainly not the only airline doing it.\n\nI am still surprised that people have such high expectations while flying.. When you buy a ticket on an airline you need to have the expectation that you are buying a seat from point A to point B. That's it. You can send your luggage fedex, bring your own food and be happy with your airline assigned (probably middle) seat. OR you can pay the airline more the convenience of additional services. \n\n"", 'They have been doing this for awhile. If you skip seat assignments for now you can probably select one at check in (and more coach seats will open closer to check-in as upgrade requests for elites are processed.)', 'Foreign airlines don\'t do this. Also, $64 seems a bit much, don\'t you think? \n\nHow is it high expectation to expect to be told in advance that if I wanted a ""preferred seat"" (again, identical size and space as any other coach seat"" I\'d be expected to pay a premium? Why do we just sit back and take whatever crappy decision the airlines make to squeeze more $$$s out of us because ""that\'s just how things are""? It\'s true, I have not crossed the Atlantic in 2 years so I had no idea this was a thing now, but why is it? \n\nNot only do the airlines reduce the size of the seats, leg room, seat padding, not only do they charge you for Internet, water, food, blanket, they also reduce the number of hubs they have so when you fly in from Europe to the East Coast you have to fly to some hub on the West Coast making your transatlantic flight a couple of hours longer than it would otherwise be thus prolonging your agony, then you have to take another plane for another 3 hrs to the East Coast. It\'s ridiculous and it doesn\'t happen everywhere. Believe it or not, there are people who are happy with their airlines, although they live mostly in Asia or the Middle East. In the meantime, we take it up the wazoo one more time because if the airline says a seat it ""preferred"", then it must be so, right?\n\nThe many airline mergers continue to leave consumers with fewer and fewer choices in the US. Can\'t wait for Emirates to come here and when they do, I will never fly an American airline again. Emirates is THAT much better.\n\nThis looks like false advertising, plain and simple me. They advertised a rate, but they should have qualified it with an asterisk or something saying ""applicable only for the crappiest seats we can assign you; if you want to sit in a seat we arbitrarily decide to call preferred, you will be charged an extra $64.25 per person"". When you book a flight you can choose which class you want to travel: 1st, business, or economy. They don\'t have further choices in economy to let you know that there are different rates for different seats, so really one can not know that they are expected to pay more for their seats until they have purchased the tickets and now want to select their seats.\n\nThere\'s 2 of us flying. For the $130 difference I would have booked a different airline on a shorter route, too. ', ""I DO think $64 is too much, but I don't work for American airlines, so I don't know what their supply vs. demand charts look like.. Obviously $64 is a number a good amount of people will pay (supply/demand) for a premium seat.\n\nOn AA.com, choosing your seat is the 4th step while purchasing your ticket. If you booked on AA.com, you would have had MULTIPLE opportunities to back out of your purchase if you weren't happy.\nIf you booked on a 3rd party site, you were just being sold the cheapest seat possible.\n\nAgain, NOT FALSE ADVERTISING - you just didn't pay close enough attention, and you were obviously going for the cheapest seat. Airlines are only selling you a seat from point A to point B. Not hard to understand, not false advertising. \n\nP.S. Emirates IS here. They fly to JFK/IAD/IAH/DFW/SFO/LAX Among others. You can book flights from Europe(which I gather you are traveling from) through Dubai to the US on Emirates.com. But let me warn you, they have THE LEAST seat width in coach on their 777s- less than any US carrier.\nAnd they don't serve caviar in coach - shocking to you I know.. "", ""You really have no reason to mock me, I don't expect caviar treatment, I expect regular service that I (and all of us) was receiving until 2 years ago. And no, I wasn't going for the cheapest seats. My 1st concern was the shortest total flight duration with the most decent layovers (no 19 hrs, 8 hrs, or other crap layover like that) which, since so many airlines merged is getting harder and harder to find, and my second concern was price. I couldn't book on American because American doesn't fly everywhere I was going so I had to go through a flight consolidator. \n\nFor the life of me I can't understand why you continue to defend the undefendable. You continue to say that it's supply and demand, that an aisle seat is now a preferred seat although it didn't used to be, and so on. What are we getting in return for all the extra fees they keep piling on? Are the tickets getting cheaper? Do you have better service, better choice of routes? If not, how can you defend the nickel and diming? In my experience the flights have been getting more expensive, the service has been getting worse, the layovers longer, the routes less convenient.

70,Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it...,2,7ac8ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7ac8ox/could_us_legacy_carriers_bring_back_domestic_3/,3,1509665206.0,"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?","[""If a 2-3 configuration was mixed with 2-2 and 3-3, wouldn't the aisle be crooked?

My partner and I just got married and he's in the airline industry. His MyIDTravel just got updated and shows that I can be booked just as he was prior in MyIDTravel. The issue arising is that we're fostering a child currently(age nearly 20 months) and wanted to test out the new travel benefits. Does anyone have insight into whether non-revs can bring a lap child with them on any airline? UA, American, Delta, Alaska preferably.","[""You should be fine. Looking on MyIDTravel both AA and DL show infants as a fare type (CL and ZL, respectively), so that'd imply you can list an infant on them. \n\nIf you look in the ID Agreements section, you can find lots of information on each airline. \n\n\nAS:\n> Infant tickets are not required for  travel within the United States. For travel to/from Mexico and Canada, please see a Customer Service Agent at any Alaska Airlines ticket counter for infant ticketing. We cannot accept infant etickets from other airlines.\n\nUA:\n> Infant/lap child eticketing on United Airlines can now be purchased on MyIDTravel.\n\nalso, great resource: http://www.flyzed.info/\n\nEDIT: Your carrier's internal website should have a bunch more info on each airline."", 'Despite being lap child, you’ll still need to be able to list all of you. He might need to call his pass office or HR to have your foster child added as a dependent, but it shouldn’t be a problem after that. Not sure about his company’s policy, but typically you are given a window of time after a “life event” such as marriage, adoption, birth of a child, etc. during which he can add the child to his benefits easily. Barring that, if he must wait until an open enrollment period, those usually happen in like October or November, so he should talk to HR (or whatever office handles travel benefits) soon. Special note: If you are planning on any international travel, most definitely do your homework ahead of time. Some countries are very particular about admitting children with someone other than their biological parents. This is to address human trafficking, custody issues, etc. Lots of boxes to check. Just a heads up.', 'The lap child can be added to your travelers documents at the airport for AS.']"
72,Seated next to an extremely obese passenger.,2,9q72vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/9q72vb/seated_next_to_an_extremely_obese_passenger/,3,1540184081.0,"Today I flew American Airlines Basic Economy.  Seated in the last row of a completely full plane.  I arrive to my seat and notice that in the middle seat was an extremely obese woman.  There was another passenger in the window seat. I walked directly to the back of the plane and quietly asked the flight attendant what I should do.  She said, the plane is full.  OK, so what should I do, she is taking up half of my seat?  Sorry ma'm, the plane in completely full, I have nowhere else to seat you, but it is a short flight!  I was incredulous.  I have no problem with sitting next to people of any size, as long as they are in their seat and I am in mine.  There was absolutely NO way the arm rest was going down.  So, I go back to my seat.  The woman immediately apologizes and says that she's happy that I am small and the was good since now we fit much better!  She was VERY likable and we chatted a bit about her grandkids, jobs, etc.  But.....I also sat at an angle the whole time because of the space issue.  Even with this, we were closely touching the whole flight.

I am going to contact AA today and provide photos (I had my husband, who was across the aisle, take a photo when she was sleeping so that she didn't know.  In no way did I want to embarrass her as there is good chance she was already feeling awkward about it).  I just wondered if there were others with such an experience and what the airline did to address the situation.  The website says that if the arm rest is not able to be lowered, the passenger has to purchase a second seat (not possible as it was a full flight) or be assigned to another flight.  Honestly, I think the issue should have been addressed BEFORE the flight.","[""Haven't experienced that (yet) but feel for you. On one hand it's not passengers' fault that seating has become ridiculous, but if you are obese you probably know it. They should buy two seats if that's the airline's rule. \n\nAirlines are not blameless when they insist on cramming more seats in. "", 'If you cannot sit squarely in your seat then your safety is at risk in an emergency. That’s reason enough to raise a concern. ', ""AFAIK, AA and most airlines policy is if they're over the arm rest by more than 2 inches, they must purchase the second seat.  On a full or oversold flight, the aircraft can not depart with an empty seat.  That means the obese person must be left behind with two people that will fit in those seats.\n\n\nDon't take my word for it, I just hear that from coworkers and never looked it up.  Additionally, don't throw my name under the bus with AA :)""]"

Back in August I book a flight from DFW (Dallas) to London Gatwick, with a connection in Reykjavic (and a stopover in Iceland on the way back).

Then about 5 months later, Icelandair has decided they don't want to fly out of DFW any longer, and give me an extra connection on both ends of the flight. It then becomes a flight from DFW to Boston, Boston to Reykjavic, and Reykjavic to London. 

The flight from DFW to Boston was cancelled, resulting in a full 24 hour delay. But the cancelled flight was operated by JetBlue. Since I bought the ticket on an EU airline with a destination in the EU, am I covered under their compensation rules? Or since it was the domestic US portion, do I go by the American rules?

Due to a situation that's come up at home, I was hoping to catch an early flight that day; there are numerous flights available all throughout the day, starting at 6:30 AM.

When I called the reservation line to try and make a same day switch, the person I was speaking to told me that they were unable to put me on the 6:30 AM flight or any other earlier flight for that matter, due to there being no ""inventory."" However, the website shows seats available for all flights Thursday that get me from RSW to SEA.

Furthermore, when I asked if I could just get to the airport early that morning and go on standby, I was told that was also not an option due to aforementioned lack of ""inventory"" and even if I went to the airport at 4:30 AM, no agent at the gate would allow me to go on standby. The only solution initially offered was for me to swap flights for a fee of $490, when the 6:30AM flight is $455. Then, the American rep on the phone literally suggested I just book the 6:30 as a one-way ticket so I could ""save on fees"" and framed it like she was being helpful.

Any advice on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated; I fly frequently, but this has been my first time with American in many, many years, and I've forgotten how awful of a company they are. Both the planes from SEA to RSW ran late due to 'maintenance issues' and I only have 40 minutes or so to make a gate change at O'Hare on the return leg. The absolute last thing I want is to miss my connection and arrive in Seattle even later/next day.

Thanks to all.
","['""Inventory"" likely refers to availability in the same booking  class that you\'re originally booked in. The booking class is generally how airlines limit the number of seats available at a particular fare. \n\nThe complexity comes from making changes to a trip in progress. Typically if the same booking class is available and the new flight meets the restrictions of the original fare rules (since all you want to do is take a different flight on the same day, it\'s likely they do), then you only have to pay a change fee. But since that booking class is no longer available, all they can do is reprice based on currently available fares. \n\nThis page seems to say that you can change the same day for $75. I think this means make the change on the same day you\'re flying. https://www.aa.com/i18n/plan-travel/extras/same-day-travel.jsp', 'On the day of departure, AA has two options for you to change your flights. Show up early and see if you can secure it. The first is called a Same Day Flight Change which is sold for $75. If the right inventory is available, you can confirm the changes to your reservation and travel like normal. The inventory control is not nearly as restrictive as it is on the days before travel so usually this can be purchased. If the flights are full and none of the SDFC inventory is available, they can do a same day standby for $75 as well. Most of the time you can get on as a revenue standby. You should get there earlier at least.\n\nThis saves on the $200 plus fare difference that AA charges for pre day of departure changes. \n\nHope this helps and safe travels!']"

Dear Ms.X:
 
I apologize that your travel was interrupted by severe weather conditions on March 13, 2017.
 
I can certainly understand how upsetting this was as it disrupted your travel plans. Keeping safety our top priority, we work closely with Air Traffic Control (ATC) to determine the best possible flight path and departure times.
 
 
I'm very sorry to read about the confusion at the airport about your return ticket.
 
I can only imagine how this made you feel. We never intended for your ticket to be canceled. I'll make sure to pass along your feedback so our airports can focus on improving our process. As a way to show we appreciate your patience, I'm sending each of you an Electronic Travel Certificate, which can be used on a future United Airlines or United Express flight. It should arrive via email in the next few business days.
 
We take issues regarding safety and security very seriously. The concerns about how we handled your ticket are understandable. While we do ensure our passenger count matches before departure, there may have been a technology glitch which canceled your return ticket. I do understand, though, as we should have been ready for you when you arrived at the airport. Your time is important. We'll work on getting better at the recovery process.
 
Montreal Convention covers actual provable damages caused by a controllable. Please send me receipts for reimbursement consideration.
 
Your request for a refund is respectfully denied as we do not refund used tickets.

Laval, March 25th 2017
 
My name is X and I’m writing this formal complaint to the person in charge of customer incl. cc legal and eservice. On February 23th, I paid 1324,90$ for 2 people(My brother, X and myself)to go to Mexico City for 6 days (March 13th to March 19th). We chose to pay more to be back on the Sunday since we both go to school and have jobs. Our problems started on March the 13th, when we arrived at the Montreal Airport (YUL), we learned that our flight (UA8481) was cancelled to Chicago due to weather. After an hour of questioning and asking United Airlines members for a solution, we finally got transferred for a flight going trough Toronto by Air Canada. We finally arrived to Mexico City, 2 hours later than our initial arrival time with flight (UA1547).
 
On March 19th 2017, we showed up at 9h30 am at the MEX airport for our flight back to Montreal. As we check in at the counter, we are told in Spanish that there is a problem with our reservation. For 15 minutes, the lady at the counter couldn’t answer any of our questions since she spoke no English. Finally, the team leader named Diana came to us and told us that the system cancelled our tickets for the flights UA1066 and UA4026! When asked why, she couldn’t give us a clear answer and said that there was probably a glitch in the system. When we asked her what the solution was, she couldn’t provide us with any solution. She offered to reserve two seats to go to Newark, USA, but after that, she had no idea what’s next or how we get to Montreal (final destination). She suggested we would call someone to pick us up in Newark, which is more than 600 miles away in a another country. We asked her to check with other airlines for a flight to Montreal but she said that she wasn’t allowed to do so. During the whole process, we are calling our parents who are panicking because their 20 and 24 years old are stuck in Mexico without any money or hotel. Our parents are able to see online some flights that we could board on time, but the lady at the counter advised us that if we book them, we probably won’t get a full refund from United Airlines. We stayed at the counter for more than an hour without any suggestion from United Airlines staff. The team leader finally suggested that we take the flight from Newark on the next morning (UA3938) and that we could be standby for the flight in the evening. We finally boarded the flight to Newark without any winter apparels. Once in Newark, we have trouble going trough the border control since we don’t have any hotel or seats for a flight. We were questioned for more than 20 minutes because of the situation. We finally arrived at United Airline’s counter to print our boarding passes and once again, we have to tell our whole story because United Airlines didn’t document any information. We go to our gate to wait and see if we can make it but the flight is overbooked. We can hear staff offering a 700$ voucher, a night in a hotel and meals for anyone who is volunteering to fly on the next day.
 
It’s now 21h30 and we still didn’t have any meals since 10 am and we didn’t get any vouchers to eat. The plane left without us and we are now stuck in another country without any information. We go to the United Airline counter and we are shocked to see that we have to retell our story since nothing was documented again, even if it was told an hour before in the same airport. The lady at the counter named “Shamonette” explains us that we cant have a hotel or any vouchers since she doesn’t understand what happened to our initial reservation. We asked to speak to a manager named Robert and after half an hour of asking, we are told we will have a hotel room. We are advised that there is only one bed in the room, and I
had to beg to get a 2nd bed since sleeping with my adult brother wasn’t an option. We then get a 10$ coupon for food in the airport, this 10$ is suppose to cover 2 meals. I had to literally beg to get a second coupon for a breakfast since we didn’t have any American money. They offered to check in our bags for free to excuse this trouble. We finally go outside in the freezing weather to wait for a shuttle for the hotel, we had to wait 40 minutes outside. We arrived at the hotel at 23h00 and we were told that we have to take a bus at 5h00 am for our flight. After a very short night (we had to sleep in our bathing suits since we had no clean clothes), we arrived at the airport and we went to check in our bags but we are asked to pay the 25$. For the fourth time, we have to retell our story and the lady at the counter goes to ask her manager. The manager accepts, but asked to keep our old boarding passes. We asked him to do some copies since we were planning to document the whole incident and it took 10 minutes for him to finally accept to copy our boarding passes. We landed in Montreal at 10 am, more than 12 hours later than our original arrival time.
 
 
 
For all the issues mentioned above I believe it is not only against the Montreal Convention, but the United Airline convention, and believe we should be refunded and compensated.

Even with all the privileges that I do have they don’t compare to the days sitting at the airport all day long waiting for my flights that are getting delayed, cancelled, or moved to twenty different gates; today is one of those days. 

The weather is terrible in Chicago IL on March, 15th, 2015.  I woke up thinking we would have spring weather and I truly feel like we are back in January.  Even though my 7:35 flight to Texas is on time it’s a two hour car ride to the airport.  Sure enough I miss my flight.  I probably wouldn’t miss it if American Airlines would update their online system before 7:20am showing that the flight is still there.  As I pull up to O’Hare International Airport I am on the phone with American Airlines and lucky for me there is another flight to Texas.  I am rebooked in less than twenty minutes.  As I step out of my cab I look at the screen and sure enough my flight that I was just booked on is cancelled.  I call the people I was planning to meet and tell them to go ahead without me.  My next flight out of Austin was supposed to go to Denver where I would spend until Friday before I go home again.  I decide to go straight to Denver from Chicago.

As I approach the gate I ask for an upgrade and sure enough I get a first class seat.  Cool right? NO!  We spend 35 minutes getting deiced, 30 minutes wondering why we are not moving, 30 minutes waiting for the mechanic to get on the plane because the pilot notified us there may be something wrong, 15 minutes waiting for the mechanic to tell us he is grounding the flight, and another 20 minutes for American Airlines to tell us that they don’t have any other plane to give us and that we must deplane.  How long was that?  Lets count (30+30+15+20)=1 hour and 35 minutes sitting on the plane without any movement.  First class did get some juice. YEY!

The rebooking nightmare begins as we all scramble to the gate agent who is looking at us like vultures.  With all my status exemptions, bla, bla, bla, I get a 9:15pm departure.  Its now close to 1:30PM.  Yikes!!!  Good news is that there is another flight out at 3:15pm and I am 2nd on standby.  

We live in a world of internet so I open up my Kyak app around 2:30pm and realize that they five seats available on United Airlines.  I call my most amazing Platinum Advantage Desk.  Sounds fancy, right?  NO!  They tell me they cannot put me on this flight because their system is showing 0 seats available.  I decide to call my company’s booking agency and sure enough I was right.  There ARE seats available.  I call Advantage Platinum Desk again and ask for a supervisor.  Gloria Garcia, a very condescending supervisor is telling me no way will she put me on that flight.  

I tried calling the customer relations department but all I get is a very lengthy voicemail of some hotshot explaining to use the web services.  I decided to write a complaint still.

Besides trying to kill time and blow off some steam, there is a point to all of this nonsense.  Accountability.  There is none!!!  Airlines like American Air keep people in the dark, which gets people frustrated and confused.  I missed two important meetings today and my job was on the line.  Knowing all this American Platinum Desk still did not want to help their Platinum member, a member who buys tickets every week two at least two or more destinations.  I am truly disappointed.   What could they have done?  Instead of giving me a juice cup they could have taken my schedule seriously and considered that there might have been a reason I woke up today at 5am to catch my 7:35am flight.  They might have figured something out.  To them, it’s a business and I get it.  But I as a customer bring them this business.  Its pitiful that they had me stoop so low as to write this.

95,Today I learned - USAir is the WORST Airline on the planet!,0,2hwvql,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/2hwvql/today_i_learned_usair_is_the_worst_airline_on_the/,2,1412130611.0,"Today is a tough day...

I will preface this story with the fact that I understand everyone dies and I don't want any sympathy.  My beautiful Grandma lived an amazing life and losing her is like losing a piece of myself.

I flew to California last Wednesday, 9/24.  My 101 year old grandmother had just died and my dad was heartbroken and the only sibling left alive to setup her arrangements.  I booked a return flight for Wednesday 10/1, on USAIR.  In retrospect, I should have booked an open-ended ticket but I was using my frequent flyer miles/dividend miles, which I had saved for this very instance.  I traveled using the lowest fair miles - 12,500 each, and you can't travel one way with dividend miles unless you just forfeit the other end of the ticket.  

When I got to California and my dad and I began making arrangements, the cold, hard reality of dying in Southern California slapped us in the face - the first available time for the mortuary and the chapel was not for seven days, on Wednesday, October 1, 2014, the same day I was due to fly home.  We tried several times to alter the days, to no avail.  This meant that I would need to change my reservation for my flight and my rental car.

Today, 9/30, I called to change my arrangements.  I had actually booked my tickets online and it didn't occur to me that it really mattered that my return flight was an American Airline flight.  As far as I was concerned, they were utilizing joint services due to their merger and that was fine.  Pre-flight they spoke about being one airline and there was no mention of this being an issue.  And then this happened...

The young lady I was speaking with was kind and courteous.  We picked a new return flight on Saturday, 10/4 and stated it would be a $150 change fee.  I understand that airlines don't believe anyone when they say they are flying due to bereavement.  It is too difficult to manage that process.  I work for a huge corporation and I get that there is no way to police that policy.  There is, however, a way to be courteous and compassionate, regardless if you believe someone or not.  

The young lady I was speaking to took my credit card information...twice, and placed me on hold for an enormous period of time, first explaining that she had issues with her computer and them stating that she needed to get the rate ""backed out"".  When she came back on the line a second time, she stated she had made an error and because my return flight had been booked on American Airlines, she could not book my return flight and I would have to use another 25,000 frequent flyer miles, forgo the other half of the roundtrip ticket and book a new flight - thus, I was being penalized because their systems were not merged with American's yet even though they were advertising that they were merging.  She stated that had my return ticket been in USAir, she would have had no issues re-issuing the ticket for the $150 fee and not having to charge me the extra miles.  

I was dumbfounded and frankly furious.  I was already at the point of tears earlier in the morning as we are preparing to bury a woman that basically raised me and that is hard enough but seriously?  Now you are taking advantage of people like that?  This is ridiculous.  I asked to speak with a supervisor.  

In comes ""Vanetta"", I think.  Her attitude was so poor and her voice so monotone, that it was pathetic.  She really didn't even care what I had to say, saying ""to the average customer it may appear that we are merged, but we really aren't.""  Frankly, that is insulting and manipulating.  You are using your systems for your advantage when it is convenient for you and taking advantage of your customers when it works to your advantage.  

""Vanetta"" did waive my $75 fee for booking within 14 days but did charge me $60 for the dividend miles that they forced me to use again, which is even more of an outrage.  I am just blown away here.  My grandmother dies, I am helping my parents take care of her funeral and this slack airline needs these nickel and dimes from me when they are making billions.  I have been a dividend mile holder for more than a decade, not that that means anything anymore - we are treated like trash anyway.  I plan on converting every last dividend mile I have to whatever else I can and getting rid of them and never, EVER flying this airline again.  This pathetic excuse and example of customer service during a time of weakness is shameful.  Redditors, help me put this pathetic airline on blast!!

Just a final note - my grandma was 101.  She lived an amazing life...you would think that would be good for something, huh?    

********************    
EDIT: I did as suggested and did some digging on the Interwebz to find the best form of contact to USAir to submit my issue. Everything I read stated to submit directly to the USAir website with meticulous documentation of the times and dates, which I did. This is my response:    

Dear Mrs. Griffin, Please accept our sincere condolences for the recent loss of your Grandmother.

The merger and our codeshare agreement with American Airlines brings you one step closer to more convenient travel, including access to more destinations, more schedule options and a truly global network.

Although we're now one company, we are still operating as two separate carriers. Our codeshare agreement is treated as with any other codeshare partner and there may be limited availability on each other’s network until we obtain and are operating under a Single Operating Certificate (which we anticipate to have 18 - 24 months after merger close).

We're sorry to hear we may lose you as a customer because of our program changes. We’re working to combine our two companies to create a better travel experience for you.

We appreciate you taking the time to inform us of your concerns. We apologize that the request was not resolved to your satisfaction; however, the matter was given every consideration and we are unable to provide the resolution requested.

We do value your business and hope you'll continue to fly US Airways and the new American in the future.

Sincerely,

Sarah Vallegas
US Airways Dividend Miles 
Case: US-14GRIFFIN-K61L11

************************    
Frankly, I am blown away. Someone help me out here because, for the life of me, I can't see the forest for the trees. I have now paid for the equivalent of four flights, with extra fees thrown in for good measure and flown only twice and no one at USAir sees anything wrong with that. I am sorry but I have an issue with just walking away from being screwed over like that. I don't care how much your systems don't talk to each other. There is a moral right and wrong here and this is just not right.   
 

Your merger and Codeshare agreements mean nothing to me. If you cannot honor the rules of your own frequent flyer program, you should not allow flights on American. You are using the merger to benefit you when it ""benefits"" you and screwing the little people in the process. It is no surprise to hear reports of unhappy workers, filthy planes and horrible treatment of our military servicemen and women.    


My request was to refund my 25,000 extra miles, and return my fees. Charge me the $150 that every other dividend miles customer gets charged when he or she has to make a change. I think that was reasonable, rather than take advantage of someone/anyone traveling to lay a loved one to rest. Having just helped my dad pay for my 101 year old grandmother's funeral, I think I have paid enough...frankly, if you have lived that long, you should be buried for free, but that is a whole other 'Reddit'. My grandmother ran out of money years ago, never imagining she would live this long - there is absolutely no beauty or grace in any of this. It was the most painful and hardest time in our entire lives and still is. We are thankful she is at peace.
","[""I'll start with, I am very sorry for your loss although I am happy to hear your grandmother lived such a long and amazing life.\n\nAs to the actual airline issue at hand...they really are telling you the truth when they say it appears as if they are merged but they really aren't completely merged. It is the grand public misconception when it comes to airlines, or really any large companies, for that matter, merging. Everyone assumes that once the merger is announced and in this case, the lawsuit is settled, that they are now one big airline that is completely intertwined. It takes multiple years for an airline to truly merge. The amount of IT systems and databases behind the simplest of transactions is unfathomable to most folks. It really is an unbelievably complex process. The same issues, including frequent flyer cross-transactions occurred during the Southwest/AirTran merger, the Delta/Northwest merger and the United/Continental merger.\n\nCould they have done more? My personal guess would be there may have been additional steps they could have done to help, but we don't know. Perhaps they could have waived ALL of the fees, but we don't know. Perhaps they could have taken normally drastic measures for them, given the situation, to figure out a way in their systems to get you a new flight without using extra miles, but we don't know.\n\nI think the best thing you could do at this point is write to an executive at the company and voice your frustration where things can really change from the top-down. Lower level staff, even managers, literally might not have the ability to make an exception or give you the service you are looking for without breaking a rule that jeopardizes their job. So go up the chain...it certainly can't hurt!\n\nBest of luck!"", 'Thanks so much. I appreciate the time and the compassion. ""Writing"" this down was just as much an exercise to help calm my already beaten nerves as it was an attempt to just get my story out in print. \n\nHaving worked for large corporations for years and been through two mergers and one acquisition myself, I do have an understanding of how some of the pieces to those puzzles work. Having flown on USAir multiple times this year, it doesn\'t really come down to the general public not understanding but rather the airlines themselves giving misleading information about where they are within the merger. This implies that the companies are operating as one. We can only go by what information us being fed to us. Take the personal factors of bereavement and emergencies out of the equation...there remains no reasonable excuse for the poor behavior or the lack of willingness to help and be cooperative. \n\nThank you, again.  I appreciate the advice and plan to use it wisely. ']"

Just as I was about to board, I had the gate attendants force us to gate check our bags. I told them I did not want to and that the last flight we took they did the same thing and there was plenty of room. They threatened to not let me on the flight, so I obliged. Then, we get on the plane and the entire bin above our seats was empty, with plenty of room. This was American Airlines. 

Do I have any rights for the next time this happens to at least try and fit my bag on the plane?","[""You can ask, but they're trying to avoid congestion when people board and can't find room, then have to back track up the aisle to gate check the bag.

As this is her second flight ever, I wanted to suprise her and upgrade this one flight to first class.

I've contacted American Airlines, who said that I'll have to go to my travel agency. At my travel agency they told me that an upgrade of a single flight (booked several more; Vienna to London, London to Miami, Miami to Exuma, ...) is not possible. I would have to upgrade all flights - which is too expensive...

My contact at the travel agency told me there is no legal way to do that.

What does this mean?
Are there other ways to upgrade this one flight?
Any other tips on how to get an upgrade?

Alaska is also increasing the price for a third checked bag, to $100 from $75. That is still below the $150 fee charged by American, United and delta.
