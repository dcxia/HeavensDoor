3,Unique air travel question .. one round trip ticket and a single one way ticket on the way back,1,9rpgda,https://www.reddit.com/r/airtravel/comments/9rpgda/unique_air_travel_question_one_round_trip_ticket/,1,1540623065.0,"Ok, so I am in a unique position- I am traveling from New York to South America round trip. When I arrive to my South American destination I will stay for a few weeks but I am bringing my wife and infant child back home with me. What can I do so that I can maximize my money and pay for my round trip and their one way ticket back to NYC ? Should I just buy a 1 way ticket to South America and a couple one way tickets to return to NYC ? Please advise as I am not familiar with how airlines and air travel works. Thank you in advance !

4,Afraid to Fly and the American Airlines Mechanics Union Dispute?,1,dkwu5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/airtravel/comments/dkwu5f/afraid_to_fly_and_the_american_airlines_mechanics/,0,1571671302.0,"Hi all, first time poster, long-time fan of Reddit. Apologies if this post is not the right area for this...but damn, I'm unfortunately one of those humans who is afraid of flying (I have taken 6 flights within the past five years via US Domestic...but I always get this sense of dread, like I'm walking The Green Mile or something).

Ironically, I'm interested in aviation, from various Youtube channels like Wendover Productions: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIdzF1\_b5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIdzF1_b5M) And Airforceproud95: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeC0ZTT8n7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeC0ZTT8n7E)

I have an American Airlines flight, Chicago O'hare to LAX in Nov. I just found out about the Labor dispute with AA's Mechanics Union, and unfortunately this has fed into my irrational fear of flying, coupled with the incident that occurred with the mechanic in Miami.

I'd love to hear from an AA mechanic about working conditions (or even anyone in the aviation industry), and I appreciate any and all folks in this community who have read this post. Thanks and take care.",[]
