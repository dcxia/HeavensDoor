1,Tips for travelling cheap,275,1ugqg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ugqg5/tips_for_travelling_cheap/,67,1388966759.0,"Here are some tips I've used to keep [my travels](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dustinbrett/sets) cheap.

**Accommodations**

* [CouchSurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org): I've used CS in many countries and besides the fact that it takes care of your accommodation costs, it's a great way to meet locals and get tips from them about there city/country. This site is about hospitality exchange and not *just* a free place to stay. Choose hosts/guests carefully based on there profile, references and request/messages. ([My CS Profile](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/dustinbrett/))

* Work Exchange: I've used these sites in San Francisco to find a hostel job and again in Medellin to find a place to teach English. Both of these jobs took care of my accommodation costs and gave me a different experience/perspective on the place I was visiting. The [Working Holiday Visa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_holiday_visa) program allows citizens under 30 to work legally in different countries, restrictions/rules vary by country. ([HelpX](http://www.helpx.net), [WorkAway](http://www.workaway.info), [World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms](http://www.wwoof.net))

* Hostels: I've stayed in hostels in many countries and can say they are great places to stay cheaply if you don't mind that atmosphere. I've stayed from $1/night in Siem Reap to $35/night in Paris but you can typically get a nice hostel for $15/night or less, unless it's last minute on a busy day. *(Get earplugs and an eye shade)* ([HostelBookers](http://www.hostelbookers.com), [HostelWorld](http://www.hostelworld.com), [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/hotels/))

* [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/): I haven't tried this myself but it's typically cheaper than hotels and you get to live like a local.

* Overnight Transport: If your trip to your next destination is going to take 7+ hours, then typically I book it as an overnight trip and sleep on the train/bus/plane, which saves a nights accommodation.

* Airport Sleeping: This can be hard sometimes but can save you a lot if you find a flight that's much cheaper but has a long layover. ([Sleeping in Airports](http://www.sleepinginairports.net/))

**Food**

* Groceries: If you have access to a kitchen then you can make your own food and save a bundle. For $20-$60 you can typically get enough food to last a week in most places in the world. ([Food Prices](http://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/))

* [Street Food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_food): This stuff is usually cheap ($0.50-$7) and can be really good. It lets you try local foods and get a local experience. ([The World's Best Street Food](http://www.frommers.com/slideshows/818551-the-world-s-best-street-food-12-top-cities))

* Fast Food: If you don't mind eating at places like McDonald's, then in some countries you will find they are a cheap option. This rule is mostly true in ""Western"" countries. ([Big Mac Index](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index))

**Transportation**

* [Public Transport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport): This is a great way to live like a local and is typically the cheapest ($0.10-$5) option to travel within a city. Check the prices for weekly and special tickets/cards as they often will save you money if you want to use the transit system often. ([Prices in 80 Worldwide Cities](http://www.priceoftravel.com/595/public-transportation-prices-in-80-worldwide-cities))

* Buses: They're typically the cheapest option and go from anywhere to anywhere. You can usually look up and even book your bus tickets online. ([Greyhound](http://www.greyhound.com), [Megabus](http://www.megabus.com), [Eurolines](http://www.eurolines.com/en/), [Willer Express](http://willerexpress.com/en/), [MakeMyTrip](http://www.makemytrip.com/bus-tickets/))

* Budget Airlines: They aren't as popular in North America but in a lot of the world there is extremely cheap flights with these budget carriers. I've flown all around South East Asia for plane tickets that were sometimes as little as $10. ([AirAsia](http://www.airasia.com), [RyanAir](http://www.ryanair.com), [JetStar](http://www.jetstar.com), [Spirit Airlines](http://www.spirit.com))

* Booking Tickets: Search several different booking sites and book with the cheapest option. You can save yourself $100's easily. Nomadic Matt did a few great articles on how he does this for flights, as well as a guide on Reddit. ([How to Be a Travel Hacker](http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/travel-hacking-guide/), [How to Find a Cheap Flight](http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/), [Guide to Airfare Search Engines](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pkl3z/can_we_get_a_few_links_into_the_sidebar/)) This method can be used for bus and train tickets as many routes have multiple carriers. ([Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.com), [KAYAK](http://www.kayak.com/flights), [Rome2Rio](http://www.rome2rio.com/))

* Bicycle: If your going to be staying a while you can buy a used bike to get around the city. If your doing a shorter trip then many cities have [bike sharing system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_sharing_system) in place where you will find a row of bikes and you can pay (typically by credit card) to rent them for 1-24 hours, or more. ([List of Bicycle Sharing Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle_sharing_systems))

* Walking: This is my main method of getting around in cities. It's free, healthy and you get a great perspective of the city and it's layout. Research where the ""bad areas"" of a city are before going on a walk so you can avoid them, unless you wanna go there.

**Gear**

* Clothing: Wear comfortable weather appropriate clothes. I've found that jeans work just about anywhere, special travel clothes are not needed, except maybe for socks and underwear. ([SmartWool](http://www.smartwool.com), [Icebreaker](http://www.icebreaker.com)) You can pack less and buy new clothes at thrift shops when you get sick of the stuff your carrying. Bringing clothes that can be combined into outfits and used alone will make it feel like you have more options.

* Backpack: Go with a pack that's small enough to be considered carry-on and you will save the $10-$50 fee for checking your bag. Check the specific airlines website for what dimensions they consider carry-on. This also cuts out waiting at baggage claim and the chances of a lost/stolen bag. ([Airline Baggage Limits](http://wikitravel.org/en/Airline_baggage), [Osprey Packs](http://www.ospreypacks.com), [The North Face](http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/sc-gear/equipment.html))

* SIM/Phone Card: If you have an [unlocked phone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_lock) then you can save a lot by buying a local SIM card for your phone rather than getting involved with roaming charges and then you'll have a local number. Some phone companies will unlock your phone if you tell them your going to be traveling. If you need to call outside the country you will likely need to [dial a code](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/dialing.html) before the number.

* Money: Instead of travelers checks use an ATM/debit card to withdrawal from ATM's, which are everywhere. Look for the [PLUS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_\(interbank_network\))/[Maestro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maestro_\(debit_card\)) symbols on ATM's and the back of your cards. You'll get a good rate and some cards don't charge a fee for withdrawals abroad. ([TD All-Inclusive](http://www.tdcanadatrust.com/products-services/banking/accounts/chequing-accounts/all-inclusive.jsp) (Canadians), [Charles Schwab](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account) & [Capitol One 360](http://home.capitalone360.com/online-checking-account) (Americans), [CAXTONfx](http://www.caxtonfx.com) (Britain's)). Bring a credit card such as VISA or MasterCard for online bookings & emergencies. Currency exchange rates are based on several factors so don't expect that the rate you get on [xe.com](http://www.xe.com) will match what the ATM/bank gives you.

* [Visas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_\(document\)): For some countries in the world you will need to get a visa to visit/work. This depends on where your from, or more specifically which passport you hand the border guards. I've found that these are easy to get in neighboring countries or at the border which can save a lot of money over getting them all in advance. Some countries require this be obtained before arriving at a border. ([DoYouNeedVisa](http://www.doyouneedvisa.com), [Schengen Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area), [VisaHQ](http://www.visahq.com/citizens/))

* Souvenirs: My preference is to avoid buying them altogether but if you decide to buy something then consider shipping it home rather than carrying it, some countries have incredibly cheap post office shipping rates. ([Post Offices](http://www.postoffice.com/))

**Sightseeing/Activities**

* Tours: There are companies that do ""free"" tours of cities with the expectation of a tip at the end. Also if your staying in a hostel they often have free tours/events during the week. ([Free City Tour](http://www.freecitytour.com), [NewEurope](http://www.neweuropetours.eu))

* Museums: Many museums have ""free"" days in which you typically pay what you want. ([International Museum Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Museum_Day), [Free Museum Day](http://freemuseumday.org/cities.html))

* Events/Meetings: There are communities within cities that organize events/meetings for free. They are a great place to meet people and learn new things. ([MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com), [CouchSurfing Events](http://www.couchsurfing.org/n/events))

**Health**

* Insurance: Check with your credit card company as they may give you free flight/travel insurance just for using there card to book flights. I think travel insurance is good to have if you can afford it but I also feel that insurance is a personal choice and I don't personally buy it anymore. Your health insurance plan within your state/province can effect the price you pay and length your allowed to be insured with certain companies. ([WorldNomads](http://www.worldnomads.com), [Travel CUTS](http://www.travelcuts.com/Insurance/))

* Vaccines: Whether or not you get vaccinated is a personal choice but certain countries do require you to be able to prove you've been vaccinated, typically for Yellow Fever. Certain health plans will give you free vaccines if you tell them where you are going. ([CDC](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list), [Infectious Diseases](http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Infectious_diseases))

**Amenities** *(Many of these places require you to be a customer)*

* Internet: Most hostels, cafes and restaurants have free WiFi that you can either directly connect to or just ask for the password. ([Hotspot Locations](http://www.hotspot-locations.com))

* Toilet: You can find a free toilet just about anywhere in the world if you look hard enough. Sometimes they are amazing and sometime it's just a hole. But it's free. ([theBathroomDiaries](http://thebathroomdiaries.com))

**Free Travel** *(I haven't tried these options and they may be illegal in some countries, but they work)*

* [Dumpster Diving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_picking): I've seen people do this and bring back an amazing amount of perfectly good packaged food. ([Trashwiki](http://trashwiki.org/en/Main_Page), [Freeganism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeganism))

* Hitchhiking: I would say this is much safer than it's portrayed and even a normal practice in some countries. ([HitchWiki](http://www.hitchwiki.org), [Tips for Hitchhiking](http://wikitravel.org/en/Tips_for_hitchhiking))

* Camping: Pitch a tent somewhere sensible such as a park, either in or outside of the city. You can use Google Maps with satellite view to look for good spots. Watch out for local wildlife. ([Countries Where Camping Can Be Totally Free](http://www.greatfamilyescape.com/10-countries-where-camping-can-be-totally-free/), [Freedom to Roam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam))

* [Street Performance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_performance): People can have a lot of fun doing this and it can easily make you enough money to survive for a day, in many tourist heavy countries.","[""Another tip about hostels: try to avoid going anywhere The Lonely Planet recommends, but look at hostels in the immediate vicinity to the recommendation. Whenever a hostel makes it into the Lonely Planet guide, they usually raise prices while letting service fall because they can and tourists will still come. However, the hostels right around that one will likely be experiencing a slight drought of customers because of the reviewed one next door and they will often do a whole lot more for you for a lot less money because they are grateful you're there.\n\nAlso, it never hurts to shop around and tell each vendor the prices of the others, giving them a chance to match it or beat it."", 'This is actually a very good and useful post. Well done!', ""What's busking?"", 'I might have to try the helpx for at least one country on my trip! Thanks for this wish i could save this thread :/', ""One of the most helpful travel websites I've found: rome2rio.com\n\nGives you info on prices and modes of transportation from city to city. Its great."", ""Good tips! I will emphasize camping, especially in forested regions. My strategy is this: whenever I get to a new city, I google search for parks, then use google satellite image to find out if there is tree cover. If so, you can stay pretty well hidden usually, and live for free. In my travels on the West Coast of Canada and the US I very rarely payed for accommodations. The downside of this is not meeting people in a hostel, which is fun sometimes. Also at least in the Coastal forests you need to beware of wildlife if you are doing any cooking or storing food. Raccoons and even coyotes will tear up your tent to look for food if your not around, and then of course there's bears."", ' Great advice!  Thanks for the post.', ""I've written an extensive guide to finding cheap flights (in the sidebar) if you'd like to add that to your post: [Guide to airfare search engines](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pkl3z/can_we_get_a_few_links_into_the_sidebar/).\n"", ""Thanks for this summary!

2,Who gets booted first due to airline overbooking (in light of United Airlines incident),38,64lun9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/64lun9/who_gets_booted_first_due_to_airline_overbooking/,67,1491882072.0,"Hey everyone, I'm not a regular to /r/travel, but I think I have a little research others might find valuable. In light of the [doctor being violently dragged off of a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/64jmub/doctor_violently_dragged_from_overbooked_united/) and the resulting social media backlash, I decided to do some digging into what airlines do when it comes to overbooking. All of the below information came from each individual airline's Contract of Carriage, which can be found on their websites (I've provided links to the ones I researched). Naturally I'm not going to have everyone's preferred airline, so don't hate on me too bad if I didn't include your go-to. 

Per regulations, every airline asks for volunteers to give up their spot for compensation. After that, airlines can set their own rules to decide who gets left behind. Now then, in no particular order...

**United Airlines** looks at several variables: Fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and time of check-in without advanced seat assignment. Basically if you're not a loyal customer and/or early bird, you might not want to get too comfortable in your seat. [Read United's full policy here - Rule 25](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec25)

**Southwest Airlines** is pretty simple. The person in the last boarding position will be denied boarding, regardless of fare. [Read Southwest's full policy here - Page 39](https://www.southwest.com/assets/pdfs/corporate-commitments/contract-of-carriage.pdf)

**American Airlines** bases the decision primarily on check-in time, but also takes severe hardships, fare paid, and frequent flyer status into consideration sometimes as well. [Read American's full policy here](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#oversales)

**Delta Airlines** has a pretty complex policy. Essentially, if you paid a premium fare, you have nothing to worry about. That said, passengers with boarding passes are safer than those who don't have them or didn't check in. In those cases, rebooked passengers or frequent flyers are safer than a passenger who didn't check in and doesn't have a boarding pass. Exception: Special needs passengers (disabilities, unaccompanied minors, etc.) are likely good to go no matter what. [Read Delta's full policy here - Rule 245 on Page 42](http://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract_of_carriage_dom.pdf)

**Frontier Airlines** has a policy about as simple as Southwest. Passengers who check in after all seats have been assigned won't get a seat. [Read Frontier's full policy here](https://www.flyfrontier.com/legal/contract-of-carriage/)

**Alaska Airlines** favors the early bird. Anyone with a confirmed seat assignment won't get booted. Don't have one? Show up early and you're more likely to get a seat. [Read Alaska's full policy here](https://www.alaskaair.com/~/media/Files/PDF/contract-of-carriage/Alaska-Airlines-Contract-of-Carriage.pdf?INT=AS_Legal_||20160816_CoC_ENG||)

**So you've been involuntarily bumped. Now what?** If they can still get you to your destination within an hour on a different flight, airlines aren't required to pay you anything. If you get there between 60-119 minutes after your scheduled arrival, you're owed 200% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $675). If you arrive 120 minutes or longer, you're owed 400% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $1350). There's other small print to go through, but that's the gist.

Like tariqabjotu, I found it interesting and neutral.\n\nWhat I don't really get is why they would assign him a seat and let him on the plane, only to expulse him afterwards. Surely, by the time they were ready to start boarding, they should have realized they had too many passengers or if they hadn't realize it, they could have left him in his seat and denied the flight to a person that wasn't on board yet, but I guess their own employees getting delayed isn't as fun as their clients. If people weren't incentived enough, they could also have offered more. The lies and shit apology also didn't help. It's incredibly poorly handled from finish to start and definitively turns me off using UA."", ""What most people are getting wrong is this: the airline was not overbooked. The airline wanted to get 4 UA employees to Louisville. It was not that they overbooked the flight. That is a logistical error on United's part and a paying passenger who's already boarded should not be removed like that when UA could have gotten them a car and taken a 4 hour drive, or put them on a later flight.\n\nI totally agree with everything you said in the case of an overbooking, and think it's a great post.

That\'s ~~75 out of 100,000~~ 75 out of 1 million passengers. We\'re talking about a very, very low chance of it happening.

Used credit card points for all long flights.",25,1y66z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1y66z0/ama_quit_job_traveled_lived_around_the_world_for/,60,1392696237.0,"I debated whether to do this because I feel kind of obnoxious being like ""Oh I'm so interesting that people will want to ask me things"" but I do find that some people are curious about what we did.

My husband and I (mid-30s, no kids) quit our jobs and rented out our home. We'd been collecting credit card airline points for years and stepped it up to earn more. We spent less than $1,000 per person total on airfare the entire year by using points, and that's with 3 international flights in business & first class. That's counting short little flights we paid with cash, too. Pretty excited about that.

I run a website that makes a little money and we maintained that on the road. My goal was to break even....but we probably spent more than we made. I had all these hopes that I would come up with new business ideas and implement them on the road. It didn't really happen. It was a combination of not being disciplined enough to put in the hard work, plus ""travel planning burnout"". It can be a full-time job just doing hours and hours of research on your flights, lodging, and sightseeing options every day. 

We have traveled quite a bit before so it wasn't ""life changing"" like first trips often are. We were very fortunate and able to see and experience some awesome things. I think many people think that ""taking a year off and seeing the world"" is some magical cure-all, but it's not. You come home to the same problems you had before. I'm sitting here at my same kitchen table right now exactly the same way I was a before the trip. Nothing huge has changed. 

Of course there were a few things I learned! I realized that I do not want to go back to a cubicle as it is detrimental to my temperament and health as an introvert and HSP. I am determined to find a way to make a living working from home. Other people can do it, why can't I? We also met tons of inspiring people who are making a living (sometimes LOTS of $$) doing all kinds of interesting online business.

Where did we go? We spent about a month each in: Playa del Carmen, Budapest, Krakow, around Bali, Melbourne & Sydney. Four months in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Shorter periods in: Sarajevo, around Croatia, Cuba, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan. We drove from Paris to Marseille (with my mom!) over two weeks. We started the trip by driving from Southern California to North Carolina.

The biggest thing I'd want to share with my fellow Americans is... **STOP THINKING THAT PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL ARE RICH. It's an excuse you make to yourself to feel better about NOT traveling.** We are totally middle class and do NOT make a lot of money. But we made travel a PRIORITY. That's the key. You have to save, plan ahead, and work hard to make it happen. We probably spent less on the road than we would living in the U.S. Example: our apartment in Thailand was $300/mo. Basically, if you dream about traveling, then just MAKE IT HAPPEN.

We were really casual about earning but stepped it up when we started this trip. You should do an app-o-rama every 91 days (this is assuming you have excellent credit and pay all your bills on time). 3 months is not a long time--that's basically just one app-o-rama.\n\nYou also need to be ready to jump on an amazing deal. About a year ago, there was a 100,000 point bonus for the Amex Platinum that worked out great for us. Use Bluebird and Amazon Payments to hit minimum spend. It does take some hours of research to learn this stuff, but I think it's so worth it. I would just start reading Million Mile Secrets as he explains things really thoroughly.\n\nIt also depends where you want to travel -- make sure you get points that will work with the airline you will be flying or hotels you are staying at. For example, we saved all these Club Carlson hotel points to spend in Japan, then realized there were almost no Carlson hotels there. Doh!!!\n\nAnd don't start earning a few points spread out on a bunch of different airlines. If you can, focus on one airline or one point currency that can transfer to your selected airline. If you've earned 20,000 points in Delta, 20,000 in United...etc. That doesn't do you much good. "", ""I personally like Sydney better. I know there's a big debate. Melbourne might be a fantastic city to live in, but I didn't find it very exciting to visit. I'm sure a lot of people would disagree. However, the food in both Sydney and Melbourne was amazing.

We didn\'t plan very far ahead, which was both good (freedom-wise) and bad (anxiety-wise).\n\nBut in cheaper places like Thailand and Bali, Airbnb doesn\'t make sense because it\'s too expensive. In Chiang Mai, we rented apartments by going to them and visiting. It sucks doing it last second like that, but that\'s just how it worked out for us.\n\nWe\'ve actually never Couchsurfed. (But we went to Couchsurfing gatherings all the time.) I\'m too much of an introvert to couchsurf and I like my own space and not having to be ""on"".  This also meant that when we rented apartment for longer periods, my husband and I required a 1-BR rather than a studio. When you are together all the time, you need your own space sometimes. This is especially true for me...I need time to recharge and focus. But we would have saved a lot of money if we got studios instead of 1-BRs all the time. Just a necessary expenditure to maintain my sanity.\n\nWe find that hostels usually aren\'t as cost-effective as private rooms when you\'ve got two people. (And even though we travel on a budget, if spending an extra $5 means we can have our own room, we do it.) I like booking with Agoda because they are cheap and you earn points for booking and for writing reviews. We earned like $90, which was awesome.', 'Most cards I have waive the annual fee the first year. And sometimes if a card has an awesome bonus but *doesn\'t* waive the fee, I still think it\'s worth it. Depends on the individual card\'s benefits.\n\nI think where you are getting a bit mixed up is the notion that the amount you spend is where you get the points. It\'s not. All my points are from sign up bonuses (for example, if a card gives you 40,000 points for signing up.) So, as long as you can reach the minimum spend, that\'s all that matters. (By ""minimum spend"", I mean if the card says ""you must spend $1,000 in 3 months to get the sign up bonus"")\n\nSo, for example, if I sign up for a card that gives me 40,000 points after spending $1,000 in 3 months, I spend that $1,000, then I\'m DONE with that card. Forever. Move on to the next card and work on reaching the spending for that one. Cancel it a year later when the annual fee hits, and the fee is refunded. (This is oversimplified, of course, but basically how I do it).\n\nIf you can\'t reach the minimum spending, there are ways to ""manufacture"" spending. These are legal--sometimes people assume you are doing something shady. It\'s not, really. I\'m getting long-winded here, so I won\'t go further into detail, but you can find it all the the blogs I mentioned earlier. :)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!

You can transfer Chase points to United, BA and other airlines.\n\nAt the moment, there aren't any decent bonuses with no minimum spend that I'm aware of."", ""The thing with miles is you can get travel for nearly virtually free (sometimes small fees) but you have to plan far in advance and work at it.

Should I go?",8,895ozg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/895ozg/question_im_a_us_citizen_my_dear_friend_invited/,60,1522735300.0,"Here is the US State Department page to which I am referring:

[Travel.State.Gov - Iran - Do not travel](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html)

Since January 10 of this year (2018), the US State Department has placed Iran on the ""Level 4 - Do not travel"" list, which is their most strident warning for US citizens to avoid a particular country, which is fairly terrifying.

I have found travel agencies and magazine articles that make it sound far less terrifying, but they do admit the fallout from the strained political relations. My friend assures me that Americans come and go all the time and they ""usually"" don't have problems, and he is sure that I won't. He is an Iranian citizen living in Tehran and I would stay with him in Tehran.

**Secondary Question:** My Iranian friend's family also has ""a house in the country"", but it is quite a few hours away by car, and he guessed that the nearest foreign embassy from *any* country is likely all the way back in Tehran. He would like to bring me there as well, but leaving the major metropolitan area where they are accustomed to foreign businessmen and tourists and crossing through areas that are far less accustomed to foreign visitors seems inherently more dangerous. Am I being crazy to think that Tehran is safer than some rural portion of Iran? This is just a gut feeling, I will probably do both locations or else avoid the whole country. If Tehran is actually safer than some other regions of the country (for US citizens, not general safety), then I will ask my friend where exactly the country house is, because that will be relevant.

* Once in the city, easily get around by walking / public transport
* Good cycling infrastructure (or at least bike awareness).  It would be nice to do a little bike tour if possible
* Neat things to do (art galleries, breweries, hiking, museums, etc).

7,"Allowed to fly to Brazil without visa on Avianca, sent home tail between legs. Recourse?",0,8pbyft,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8pbyft/allowed_to_fly_to_brazil_without_visa_on_avianca/,47,1528419451.0,"Short version: American citizen flew Avianca airlines to Brazil but didn't have a visa so was sent back to origin country. Yes, stupid to not realize Brazil required a tourist visa before landing, but why TF did Avianca let me board the plane, let alone check in, without showing proof of visa? 


I decided quite last minute to join a friend on a trip to Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I found a cheap flight from my current home base of Santiago, Chile, and did extremely minimal planning since this friend knows his way around and already had an itinerary. This was going to be my first time in Brazil but my ~10th Latin American country and I have never needed a visa before landing (except Cuba and even there I was able to get my visa in Ft. Lauderdale day of the flight). 

I get to the Santiago airport, have zero problems checking in and boarding, an uneventful flight with a subpar quiche, and landed in Sao Paolo at about 4am. I get to the immigration desk in my just-woke-up daze, hand over my passport, and after flipping through it a few times the immigration officer brusquely asks where my visa is. I tell him I don't have one yet, where do I go to fill out the paperwork or pay the fee, whatever. He looks through my passport again and angrily tells me he won't let me in, I need a visa, WTF am I doing there without a visa, frothing at me like I just ruined his day and this isn't his fucking job. 

At this point it feels like I'm in movie. I imagine I went very pale, my mouth got bone dry, everyone was looking at me. The Brazilian couple behind me tried to help, explained to the guy in the booth that I was probably just transferring through Brazil and it shouldn't be a big deal. I said no, I am here for 10 days on vacation, and they looked at me kind of incredulously like am I an idiot, why the hell didn't I get a visa first, and then wished me luck as though they knew I would have none.

It's very strange to be in a country illegally. Obviously the plight of the illegal immigrant in the US is far worse but I feel like I can sympathize better now. I sat around for a few hours, watching Joao the immigration officer gloat to all of his friends about the stupid American who tried to get into Brazil without a visa, waiting for someone from the airline to come arrange a return flight. Finally this extremely sheepish Avianca rep shows up and explains to me that I'll have to fly back to Santiago, I don't have to pay extra, they'll bump forward my original return flight, etc. There was another American girl in the same situation and I got the impression from the rep's manner that this was not supposed to happen, that he was hoping we didn't know it wasn't supposed to happen and wanted us to feel like it was our fault even though he knew someone had fucked up on his end for us to even be there. An old, bored looking airport security guard was assigned to watch us, escort us through the terminal to my gate through the back hallways that staff use. After a few more hours of waiting I boarded my plane and was home about 16 hours after I had left, not even a Brazilian passport stamp to show for my shitty adventure.

I'm not even going to ask if this has happened to anyone else because I know it must have if it's actually policy to let people board flights when they don't have visas. It seems to me that some lazy Avianca employee in Santiago overlooked the missing Brazil visa and gave me my boarding pass. But then the immigration officer who gave me my Chile exit stamp, who I told I was going to Brazil, should have noticed I didn't have a Brazilian visa, so at least 2 people had to have fucked up (Ok, 3, I take most of the blame for this myself but I would have saved a hell of a lot of time and self pity had they just turned me away at the Santiago airport).

I found an [IATA article](http://airlines.iata.org/analysis/document-verification-travel-trouble) about how common this actually is: as of 2016, more than 60k passengers a year are turned away at their destination due to inadequate airline vetting of paperwork. Each time, the airline has to pay a fine to the offended nation. But I can't seem to find anything about compensation to the passengers who waste time and money and leave (more than) a bit humiliated.","[""Why are you blaming airline personnel for your own mistakes? Most of their customers probably don't need a visa on that route, so it's easy to overlook. Exit immigration isn't focused on your visas either, they just check if you didn't overstay and have the proper papers.\n\nYou're the only one to blame for this."", 'I cannot see why you should be offered compensation for this! You are the one that made a mistake not checking if your visit required a visa. Why would you even ask that?

But as far as their relationship with you the passenger goes, they actually were trying to perform their part of the bargain when you bought their ticket. \n\nAnd no, you shouldn't blame the exit immigration officer either, as you shouldn't expect them to know what visa requirements are needed for any citizen given any destination. All they care about is whether you are exiting lawfully or not.\n\nYou actually have to thank Avianca that they were willing to modify your reservation so they would fly you back earlier than expected.\n\nBy the way, there are 4 billion air passengers that fly a year. 60K is actually rare if you look at the bigger picture."", 'If you were flying from the US more than likely they would’ve checked for visa prior with an American passport.

8,A Travel Agents Confession (warning this is long),78,83mp1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/83mp1t/a_travel_agents_confession_warning_this_is_long/,46,1520803685.0,"I just want to start off and quickly mention that I am not a writer, I apologise in advance for poor sentence structure and grammar, but this is something that I need to get off my chest. I’d also like to mention, that I will be speaking in particular of the Australian industry, however do note that this company  operates worldwide, and therefore I would not be surprised if what I’m about to say holds true for most, if not all Travel Agents, and the industry as a whole.I’ll start at the beginning. Why I got into the job, and the reason most people enter the industry. You have the travel bug, maybe you’ve backpacked through Europe, had a beer in Munich, and a coffee in Florence. You’ve flown to Japan and watched the colourful Autumn leaves pass you by, as you ride the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka.  It suddenly dawns on you; that you would love to work in a job, where all you did was talk about travel, to other like-minded people. You get to send families on their dream holidays, or organize a honeymoon for a newlywed couples first time overseas. 

&nbsp;

You know from the start that it’s going to be a sales job, your selling travel after all. But people get along with  you; you have a bubbly personality, and actual passion for what your selling. You get excited when you talk about travel, people can see that and in turn get excited themselves. So you take to the internet and apply for the job. Shortly after you’ll get a phone call.  You get asked why you applied for the position, and express your excitement and experience. Phone call is short and quick, next is the group interview. For some people this can be daunting. You’re in a room with 40-50 other people. You’ve got this though, you make sure your voice is heard, and that the interviewers notice you. You aren’t shy, and your confident in group environments. Excellent! You’ve been chosen. Shortly after you’ll get another phone call formally offering you the job.  It’s off to training! 

&nbsp;

I won’t go into too much detail, training for this company was long, and consisted of primarily sales based workshops. How to handle objections, closing a sale, etc... You get set up on the computer systems, flight software, and so on. They spend most of the time getting you excited. They tell you how lucky you are to be in a job selling something everyone loves! Your told of all the incentives and rewards that successful agents attain. Your also told that you decide how much you earn. Yes it is minimum wage, however you are constantly reminded that you have uncapped commissions! The sky is the limit. They do however explain that you also won’t earn a huge amount of money in your first year. It makes sense how they explain it. You have a client base of zero. You spend your first year building a client base, and the following year you should be getting lots of repeats from the previous year. Ok I got it. Work hard my first year, build my client base, and earn more the following year. 

&nbsp;

Initially, most new agents are placed in quiet stores; so you have time to build up your skills before your placed in a busier location. I call these stores recycle stores. The store itself is most likely to be a non-profit store. That simply means that the store is working at a loss. It may be a lower income area, or simply because agents cycle through these stores at an alarming rate that local clients are hesitant to re-book as their last agent “just up and left”. The real reason you are here is to prove to other stores how good of a salesman you are. You’ve used the slow paced environment to get the hang of how the industry works. How to pay off suppliers, issue name changes for flights and so on. Agents who don’t do well all end up quitting. It’s understandable, uncapped commissions mean nothing if you’re not selling enough travel. This is why I call them recycle stores. Sell enough TTV (total transaction value) and the poaching begins.

&nbsp;

You’ve proven to the company,  and to other in-profit stores that your worth having. Soon enough you’ll get an offer to work for another store. It may be in a busier location or higher income area. You jump at the opportunity, you’d be crazy to turn it down right? You’ve made it through all the interviews, proven your sales skills and now’s your chance to earn those higher commission bonuses. Yes you got into the job because your passionate, but at the end of the day you have bills to pay, and your excited to see how much you can earn. So you accept the offer, and off you go. 

&nbsp;

You’re in a whole new ball park now. This store is an in-profit store, you’re in the big leagues boy. I’ll take a brief moment to explain how in-profit stores work, as it will give you more context as to why they run the way they do. The manager of the store has “bought into the businesses” think of it as a mini-franchise. The manager now gets a small cut of the profits. The better the store does, the more money the manager earns (as well as any commission they make). This is why your often sent into a recycle store first. No in-profit store is going to want to take a newbie, who is constantly asking questions, or requiring help. Nobodies got time for that.  The store also pays for your “seat” out of its profits. The manager is spending money on keeping your ass on that seat, so you better dam well start earning your keep. 

&nbsp;

This is where mark ups, or so called “service fees” come into play. You realize that you can charge the customer any amount you want. Your invoice system allows you to put any dollar figure you want into it. But that’s not who you are, you aren’t here to rip people off. Your good at what you do…. 
Wrong.

&nbsp;

It doesn’t matter how good you are. You’re not going to sell enough travel to satisfy your targets, or make any money for that matter. I won’t go into any specific details on how the commission structure works, but I will clarify a few things. When you deal with “preferred” suppliers, those who have strong relationships with the company, you are paid specific percentages for your service in selling that product. Airline tickets make you shit all. On average 0-4% of the base fare (not including taxes), hotels and tours can make you 8-12%. You might be thinking wow! I can make a lot of money selling big holiday packages. Short answer is no. That commission you make goes into the stores profits. The company takes a big slice, the store manager takes another slice. And your forced to lick up the crumbs off the floor. 

&nbsp;

You’ll have daily meetings, one-on-ones with your manager, asking why you’re not making enough commission for the store. If you don’t start earning more, you won’t be worth the cost of the seat your ass is perched on. You proclaim that your selling travel as best as you can. Your super passionate. People have brought you in gifts, or bought you a cup of coffee for your services. However, there just isn’t enough volume for you to make any more commission. You’re not the only agent there. Everyone else is trying to hit their targets not just you. During one of your daily meetings your manager starts talking to you about “service fees” They way its explained makes sense, but it does rise some conflict inside of you. Its explained that people are coming to you for a service. They want the hassle of organising a holiday taken over by someone else. Well ok! How do I charge my service fee. Do I tell the client at the start that It will cost then a fee to use me as an agent? Absolutely not your manager will proclaim. We do not tell clients that they are being charged a fee, they should just expect it. Well, ok then, how do I Invoice them the fee? Simple he/she will say. By marking up the products that you are selling. You see, any mark-up you make is pure “commissions”. Mark something up by $20 and that’s another 20 for the stores profits, regardless of what the supplier is paying. 

&nbsp;

 Alice…. Your deep into the rabbit hole now. 

&nbsp;

You see. People don’t just come in everyday and ask you to put together a massive holiday package, or to drop 20 grand on a luxury European river cruise. Most of the time people will come in for simple flights. These things take time out of your day to book. Time that could be better spent chasing up leads for bigger bookings that will actually make you money towards your target. You can’t just turn them away so you have to sit there, smile, and all the while try to calculate how much you’re going to mark up their flight to make it worth your time.  Against what your guts telling you, you bump up the ticket by $20 dollars. They pay for it,  all the while your smiling and assuring them this is the best price. 
Your colleague next to you sends you a cheeky email and asks how much your marked the flight up by. You tell them, to only hear laughter. See, this is the colleague that’s always smashing their targets, when seemingly see them getting just as much business as you are. The answer is simple; service fee service fee service fee. See while you’re sitting there feeling guilty about your $20 mark up, colleague over there is marking flights up by hundreds. 

&nbsp;

You might be thinking, people are going to catch on, they’re going to go home, maybe check the price of their flight and come back with a vengeance. While yes that does happen, it’s not as common as you think. There are two types of people who come in and just buy flights. The first are those who are ignorant about travel agents. They already have a price in their head, they just have this insane notion that agents get access to special deals. You tell them your price, and they walk off laughing. The second group are those who aren’t so tec sav. Grandma isn’t going home and jumping on Skyscanner and putting together a multi stop trip in Europe. Or Bob, he doesn’t know that you can fly into one airport and out of the other on the same airline ticket. He’s essentially searched for two one way flights. Stacy doesn’t know that Virgin Australia partners with American Airlines. She’s googled a return flight LAX and searched for internal fights separately. Little did she know that if she booked it all on the one ticket she could save thousands on her family holiday. The way its explained is that you have done a service for these people. They would of spent so much more (through their lack of knowledge) that you shouldn’t feel guilty applying a $500 service fee for a simple multi stop airline ticket. 

&nbsp;

Your job now becomes a game. Your trying to figure out how much the client knows, how much you can mark up their holiday while still seeming like you’re giving them a good “deal”. You know how the game works. You’re a born salesman, you can read people. All of a sudden, the money comes rolling in. You’re a top seller. It’s all about the numbers baby. Your constantly getting shout outs for being a high performer.  You’re out for celebratory drinks during one of your monthly award nights, you’ve smashed all your targets and you’re really going places. After a few too many you stumble into an Uber and make your way home. During that ride it suddenly dawns on you. You’re not that bubbly person you once used to be. You’re not passionate about selling travel anymore. In fact, no one you’ve met in the industry that is successful has that passion. You saw new agents walking around that night, with a spark in their eyes that you once had. They’ve done really well and have just been offered a transfer to a higher profit store. 

&nbsp;

You realize that you have sacrificed who you once were. It’s all a numbers game now. How can I charge this person the most amount of money without them noticing. That excitement in your voice is still there, but only because you know it gets people excited, and more likely to spend money with you. You stumble out of the cab and drop into your bed. You need to get everything off your chest. So you turn on your laptop and start writing this confession. ","['[deleted]', 'Good read, i wouldn’t say most of what you wrote is surprising. Ofcourse you guys need to make money for your time. Do you believe however that it is too predatory? That the sales staff has too much flexibility on the markup? For instance would someone change an elderly person 700 AUD for a 200 AUD flight with a 250% markup? Or do most try to stay below 10 or 20% ', ""Thanks, that was a very interesting read. Obviously you guys do need to make money and there's no shame or guilt in that but the lack of transparency is certainly concerning."", 'I worked as a travel agent for a short period of time. My experience actually sounds like it was pretty different from yours, although it was equally negative. \n\nMy agency was an independent, standalone store (so there was no opportunity to transfer to other affiliated stores) and my training was more technology-oriented rather than sales-oriented (i.e. learning how to use the various booking and client systems). I also liked the owner and other agents a lot, although most of them didn\'t work in the store like I did, they worked remotely.\n\nWe also were very open about the fees we charged. If someone came in to book a trip, I would tell them upfront ""there\'s a $500 service fee."" It was kind of shocking how many customers didn\'t expect there to be service fees, or even assumed booking through a travel agent would somehow be cheaper than booking on their own. \n\nWould you assume it would be cheaper to file your tax return through an accountant rather than doing it yourself? Would you assume your mechanic wouldn\'t charge a fee for their time to fix your car? Probably not. Travel agents are in the service industry - you pay them money so you don\'t have to do the work yourself. However, I would say the majority of potential customers (mostly families with kids or elderly adults) didn\'t expect it to work that way, which was a bit odd to say the least.\n\nHowever, we were also located in a high-income neighborhood, so we did have a decent number of customers come in wanting high-end trips and not caring what the fees were (mostly couples). These people were obviously our target market, and the only true opportunity for making money. \n\nThat said, because I was the newest agent at my store I almost *never* got to work these clients, and therefore I made almost no money. I was stuck working with clients who wanted to book a Carnival cruise, or who thought I had the magic powers to make a $500 weeklong trip to Paris possible (including flights).\n\nIn the end, I just found the trips I was booking to be extremely dull (family of four going to Seaworld, yay!) or so far beyond my personal travel experience that I couldn\'t even relate ($15k for 2 weeks in Thailand). As a mostly budget traveler myself, I just started to feel weird about the whole thing...and the extremely poor money I was making didn\'t help.\n\nIn the end I quit after just a few months.

9,Visa tips and requirements,134,3s3gnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3s3gnl/visa_tips_and_requirements/,45,1447073089.0,"The rules for visas can be confusing, so I thought I'd put together some info on applying for them.  Some of this info will be a little US-centric, but the general process will be the same regardless of which passport you have.  

A visa is basically permission to enter a country.  You **always** need a visa when visiting another country, but some countries have set up a (reciprocal) 'visa-waiver' where you don't need to apply for one if you meet the visa waiver requirements.  These requirements will depend on which passport you have.  For example, US citizens (and Australia/Canada/etc) can visit certain European (Schengen) countries for combined 90 days out of 180 days without a visa.  However, if you want to stay more than 90 days in the Schengen zone, you **will** need a visa.  Thailand is another example, where US citizens don't need a visa if staying less than 30 days (arriving by air) or 15 days if arriving via land.  Most Western Europe/Canada/USA/Australia passports are lucky as many European/North American countries do not require visas for short visits.  Failing to check visa requirements beforehand can be a very expensive problem! Airlines will refuse to let you board unless you have the correct documentation.  One other important thing to check is how much time is left before your passport expires, many countries require your passport to be valid for 6 months (even if your stay is shorter).

A good place to start checking visa requirement is the Wikipedia page.  Search for 'Visa requirements for X citizens' where X is your passport.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Australian_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_British_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Canadian_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens

etc.

Or check the 'visa policy of X' for the country you are planning to visit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Thailand

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Vietnam

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_India

etc.

Really the best way to check if you need a visa is using the TIMATIC database, this is what the airlines will use.

**Visas at an embassy/consulate:**  If you require a visa, usually you must apply for a visa at a country's consulate or embassy.   The actual visa is a stamp or whole-page sticker in your passport.  Visa requirements unfortunately can vary per embassy, but the basic things you will need are a filled out application, visa fee, and your passport.  There are usually three ways to go about applying.  First, you can go to the embassy/consulate yourself.  This is obviously inconvenient if you don't live in a city with a consulate.  This also involves some amount of waiting time, so you will need at least a free day.  Another way of applying is using a visa service.  You send them your application, passport and visa fee.  The visa service also will charge their own service fee on top of that.  The final way to apply is to send the application directly to the embassy/consulate via USPS/FedEx, with a pre-paid return envelope.  However, some embassies (eg. China in the US) no longer accept mailed-in applications and you must use a service or apply in person.  Best to check the application requirements on their website.

However you apply, the visa can take several days or weeks to issue, so be sure to give yourself plenty of time.  If using a visa service, add an extra couple of days.  Some places offer same-day or next-day processing for an extra fee.  I always use some sort of tracking (FedEx, US Priority Express) so that I can keep track of where my passport is and when it is on it's way back.  I actually applied for a visa last week and I saw my return tracking go live yesterday, I'll have my passport back tomorrow.

Payment for visas is usually via cashier's check/money order, at least in the US.  In some other countries, if applying in person you must go to the embassy, get a form then go to a bank and pay, get a receipt, then return to the embassy with that receipt.  Pretty inefficient unfortunately.  This is what I had to do when applying for my Iranian visa in Istanbul.

Checklist for applying for visa (* are sometimes requirements):

* Passport
* Filled out application (usually x2)
* Passport photos (usually x2)
* Visa fee
* Copy of flight itinerary
* Prepaid return envelope (if applying via mail/visa service)
* Copy of Hotel reservations(*)
* Cover letter(*)
* Copy of Bank statement(*)
* Copy of Yellow-fever vaccination(*): required for some African countries
* Letter of introduction from travel agent(*) : required for Russia, some African and Central-Asian countries

The visa application can usually be downloaded from the embassy website.  VisaHQ is another good (US) resource for finding applications and requirements (generally http://<countryname>.visahq.com)

For the copy of the flight itinerary, I will use something like TripIt and generate an itinerary without actually buying the tickets.  Not completely kosher, but I like to pad my planned visit dates by a day or two on either end just in case plans change (I still put in the same flight numbers I plan to use) or the visa gets denied for some reason (luckily Iran's so far the only one I've had denied).  I ended up needing this padding when visiting the Congos a few years ago... my flight to Kinshasa (DR Congo) was diverted to Brazzaville (Rep Congo).  If my Rep Congo visa wasn't valid yet I wouldn't have been able to get off the plane.

The cover letter is usually optional but I'll usually write one. Basically it just lays out what kind of visa I would like, and my planned itinerary and perhaps something nice to say about the country I am visiting.  

**Visas on arrival:** Some countries can issue a visa when you arrive at the airport or at a border.  These on-arrival visas may have different stay requirements or fees than one obtained in an embassy.  Some visa on arrival require pre-authorization before travel.  This can be arranged usually though a travel agent, hotel, or website.  The pre-authorization can take a few days.  You will receive a confirmation email that you show at airport checkin and on arrival to receive your visa.  There will usually be a window labeled 'VISA' before immigration where you will get your visa sticker.  

**e-visas: ** These are the latest type of visas, which require applying and paying online ahead of your visit.  Similarly to pre-arranged VOA, you will get a printout/verification that you show at immigration on arrival.  This verification can take a few hours or days to receive.  E-visas may also have different requirements/limitations than a visa issued at an embassy.

**Passport photos:** Most paper visa applications require one or two passport photos.  It's actually quite easy and cheap to make your own.  You will need a tripod or someone to take a photo of you against a white background.  An easy way to do this is to drape a sheet over a door.  Don't worry about getting the photo perfectly centered.  Just make sure to have a neutral face, nothing covering your face, etc.  Then use an online photo-sizing tool to center the face.  2""x2"" are usually fine when applying for visas.  You can then use GIMP/Photoshop/etc to create a tiled 4""x6"" image (6 photos).  Some online sites can do this as well.  You can then upload & print this at Walgreens/CVS/Walmart/etc for $0.30 or so.  I'll usually get 3-4 printed at a time as I apply for a lot of visas! If you use European/UK visa photo (35mm x 45mm) tiling you can get 8 per page.

Here are some countries that require some sort of visa:

* USA: Requires pre-approval (ETSA) if from a visa-waiver country.  (https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/)
* Australia: requires pre-authorized ETA (US) or eVisitor Visa (UK)  (https://www.border.gov.au/Trav)
* India: e-visa (https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/info1.jsp)
* Turkey: e-visa (http://www.evisa.gov.tr)
* Iran: Complicated.  Some countries get visa-on-arrival (Aussies).  Brits/Canadians/US need a visa beforehand. 
* Egypt: Visa on arrival, easy
* Bahrain: e-visa (https://www.evisa.gov.bh/) or visa on arrival.
* Jordan: Visa on arrival (at airport), easy. Visa required beforehand if crossing overland at Allenby bridge.
* Brazil: US citizens need a visa, Europeans don't
* Argentina: US citizens must pay reciprocity fee before travel ($160) - https://reciprocidad.provincianet.com.ar/ but good for life of passport
* China: Visa required beforehand.  Some countries can get 72-hr visa-free transit (eg. flying USA -> Beijing -> Thailand you could stay 72 hrs in Beijing).
* Vietnam: Visa-free (Brits, some Europeans) for 15-day stays.  For longer stays, or US citizens, pre-authorized visa on arrival available at airports only.  Otherwise visa required beforehand if arriving via land.
  Pre-authorized visas can be arranged through http://www.myvietnamvisa.com , http://www.vietnamvisa.org, etc.  There are lots out there, just pick the cheapest.  Takes 2-3 days to get the visa authorization.

* Thailand: Visa-free for 30-days if arriving by air. 15 if arriving via land.
* Laos: Visa on arrival
* Russia: Visa required beforehand.  It may be possible to visit St. Petersburg and some other cities for 72-hrs without a visa if you are on a cruise/tour.
* Sri Lanka: e-visa (http://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/center.jsp?locale=en_US)

If you're new to solo travel, I recommend reading the whole guide, but if you're pressed for time I have a tl;dr tip list in the comments. The tip list has stuff the guide doesn't and vise-versa, so if you're genuinely looking for info and advice, I'd read everything. Please forgive me if this isn't the type of content this sub likes :(


**Intro**


I don't claim to know everything or to be an expert on this sort of travel. As far as these things go, my trip was fairly short (2 months). Despite that, I feel like I have some good information on things I wish I knew before I left and things I learned along the way that will be useful for the next trip. The countries I visited were Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia. I would say that I'm a 65/35 extrovert/introvert split, 24, Canadian, white, and male, so keep that in mind if I mention social behaviours. This post will be thicccc and daunting but don't let that discourage you! I learned most of this stuff as I went and didn't have a stressful time doing so. Hope this little guide helps someone out there!


**Resources**


Subreddits like /r/travel and /r/solotravel were super helpful. They were good for pre-travel questions and advice. During the trip (booking, transportation, etc.) I used:


- HostelWorld. It's an app for booking hostels and it's the best. Pay attention to reviews before booking!


- Booking.com if you can't find anything worthwhile on HostelWorld.


- Google Flights, SkyScanner, and CheapFlights for flights. If you're familiar with the airlines operating in the area, check their websites directly too. They're usually cheaper for booking.


- Rome2Rio (an app and website). This is for figuring out how you can get from point A to point B.


- FlixBus (app and website). Pretty much always the cheapest option for getting from place to place. I used FlixBus exclusively to get around the entire continent.


**1. Before you leave**


*~ Planning the trip*


I don't suggest planning. The last thing you want is to hear of a cool thing or a cool place from other people and not have room in your itinerary to do it. Be flexible. Have a starting city/area in mind. I would also not suggest booking a return flight if you know you're going to be travelling for a month or more. If you need to be back by a certain date, figure out a rough trail you'll be taking and decide on an end point. Book your flight from there. Aside from that just go with the flow. I'd maybe suggest being aware of travel season though. Europe gets really busy in the summer. Autumn and spring are still busy, but less-so. Winter is usually the most quiet but a lot of the typical tourist things aren't available or aren't as accessible.


*~ Banking*


Generally, banks can charge you in 2 ways for cash withdrawals when you're abroad: exchange fees and transaction fees. The exchange fee is for converting your home currency to your withdrawal currency. Transaction fees are what they charge you for withdrawing from ATMs abroad. Ideally you'll want an account that is low-cost and allows for unlimited withdrawals with no, or a small foreign exchange and transaction fee. It's important to talk to your bank directly. Most banks have deals with European banks to waive these fees with certain account types.


*~ Credit cards*


Sometimes it's easier to get a credit card with no exchange fees (explained above) than a bank account. Of course, as with any credit card, you want to avoid withdrawing cash. Most places take Visa, Maestro, and MasterCard. Don't take your American Express and expect to use that everywhere. Do a bit of research to find a card that's best for you. It won't always be through your bank. For example, I have the Amazon.ca Visa, which had a free sign up and waives exchange fees completely. Try to bring 2 credit cards: your travel card and your normal at-home card.


*~ Cash*


Bring enough cash for a cab from the airport, if you need a cab. More on transportation later. 99% of airports have ATMs so if you're uncomfortable with your bank's exchange rate for foreign currency, just withdraw from an ATM when you arrive. **Make sure you're familiar with exchange rates before you withdraw.** If you take out too much money there isn't anything you can do about it unless you Western Union it back to yourself. You *will* lose money doing that though. Be cautious.


*~ Currency exchange*


Avoid this when possible. Avoid all ""0% commission"" places LIKE THE PLAGUE. They advertise 0% commission but will absolutely ravage your wallet on in-house exchange rates. For example, if your currency exchange is sitting at 0.25 (1$ buys 0.25 of whatever), these places can and will charge as low as 0.10 ($1 buys 0.10). Western Union endorsed exchange booths are usually more reasonable. They'll have the WU sticker in the window. Just make sure that you know exactly how much money you're getting when you do the exchange. Again, it's best to avoid this altogether if you can. If you do your banking right (explained above) you should not have to do any currency exchange.


*~ Insurance*


Yes, you need travel insurance. You don't want to be caught without it. Don't be shy about spending more on a premium package for your insurance if you're not sure about which package to get. I was diagnosed with myocarditis in Germany and got stuck in the hospital for 11 days. My bills topped $12000 CAD. The insurance will be taking the brunt of that. Get. Travel. Insurance. If you have them in your country, I recommend Blue Cross. Otherwise, most banks offer travel insurance packages at reasonable prices if you're their customer already.


*~ The pack*


Pack light. Generally, you'll want your main bag to not be over 8kg to avoid baggage fees. Keep in mind you'll be carrying your bags around *a lot*. Don't overencumber yourself and consider getting a hiker's pack instead of a rolly suitcase. Each airline has different regulations surrounding personal carry-on items so check that before your flight. It's usually 2-4kg on top of your 8kg main bag. The clothes you bring will depend on weather. If there's one big tip I can provide here, it's that you can and should buy things while you're away. Humana is a vintage clothing shop with something for everyone at good prices. I needed a coat when I got to Vienna and bought a good one for 10 euro. I never had to pack it up since after that point I wore it everyday. In terms of toiletries and hygenic products, bring enough for the first week or so, then buy as you go. Here are some items I recommend bringing that you may not have thought of:


- Towel. A small one.


- A separate bag that you can easily put in your pack. This will be for when you're just walking around the city or on a day trip. I recommend a drawstring backpack.


- Reusable water bottle.


- At least 2 pens and the smallest notebook you can find. You never know when you'll need to write something down quickly.


- Advil/Tylenol. If you plan on being hungover this will be a very precious item. Bring allergy meds if you're prone to allergies.


- Sunscreen. If you're in a sunny place, sunscreen will be stupid expensive. Bring some with you.


Things that a lot of people bring, but that you should ditch. Please remember this is subjective but it's what I suggest:


- Camera. Bring a cellphone with a competent camera instead. Unless you're crazy about photography and absolutely need to bring that heavy DSLR, then just leave it at home. Thank me later.


- Laptop. I was thankful for having my laptop when I was in the hospital (more on that in the insurance section) but otherwise it was weight I could have done without. If you reeeeeally want to bring your own laptop, get a Microsoft Surface or some other full Windows tablet.


- Umbrella/poncho. Bring a water resistant windbreaker or something instead, or better yet, do indoor stuff on rainy days.


- Travel books. Just look online or have e-books on your phone or e-reader.


And finally some must-haves. These are classic items most people know about but that you should definitely not forget:


- Cellphone. Most hostels have public computers but if not, your phone is your lifeline. More on the phone later. Bring one.


- Ear plugs AND eye-mask. Yes, both. These aren't just for hostels. They can transform a bus or a plane into a decent sleeping experience. I had foam ear plugs personally. They don't block all sound of course but they make noise less harsh.


- Plug adapter. I bought a pack of 3 small ones and brought all 3 to Europe. Used all 3. That's a bit overkill but if you have the space I'd suggest bringing at least 2. Lending them out is a good way to make friends as well :)


Optional items and/or weird things I brought that I was thankful I had. You can do without these items for sure but I was pretty happy I had them:


- Travel-sized blanket. I had 2 or 3 hostels that didn't provide thick enough blankets for how cold the dorms were. I used this blanket a heck of a lot.


- Travel pillow (one of those donut ones). I got a shitload of sleep on buses because of this bad boy. If you put the ring on your shoulder and lean on the window, you'll be super comfortable. Promise.


- E-reader. I'm not much of a bookworm but sometimes scrolling through endless memes on your phone gets a bit old. Battery life on these things is excellent as well. Charged mine once in 2 months.


- Swimtrunks. These are good to wear on laundry days because you don't necessarily need underwear for them and they (somewhat) get clean when you go for a swim :) If you don't bring trunks then bring something to wear on laundry days that is not a part of your main clothing cycle. When you are using so few clothes you want to maximize what gets washed.


*~ What to download on your phone before leaving*


- Maps.ME. This is a great app for offline maps. Download the area you're landing in and take it from there.


- Offline Google Maps of where you're landing. You can do driving directions and search stuff by keywords/name while you're offline as well so this is a must.


- Screenshots of public transit directions. You won't be able to get these offline so make sure you know what you're doing. More on this in the transportation section.


- Google Translate with offline languages for at least your first country. This way you can do offline translations if you need to.


- Pictures of your passport and any important documentation surrounding health insurance or visas. Send these to a friend or family member from your home country in the event of an emergency and keep copies on your phone.


- Obviously movies/TV shows/music. Don't forget that Netflix lets you download a big chunk of their library for offline viewing.


**Tourist info hubs**


These places are your best friends. Ask them anything from how public transit works, to which clubs are good, to which hikes are available outside the city. They are a wealth of information and they're free so take advantage. You'll see them everywhere but mostly at train/bus stations.


**Transportation**


*~ Local transportation*


Don't be afraid to take public transportation. Cabs are really expensive and that will add up. If they know you're a tourist then they might try to gouge you as well. I got charged 35 euro for a 10 minute cab ride in Lisbon when the Uber for the same route was under 10 euro. Generally people are more than happy to help if you're unsure about where you're going or how the system works. Google Maps is your best friend here for directions. Most European cities operate with ticket machines. If you can't find a ticket machine, you can typically buy a ticket on the bus/tram directly from the driver with some change. You might see some little machines with ticket slots on them on buses, trams, and before going into the metro. Those are for validating your ticket. Make sure you do this! Tickets are usually time based so you need to validate the start time of your travel.


*~ Regional transportation: Trains*


This is a bit controversial. A lot of people swear by the Eurail passes for trains. They're good because you can hop on/off anywhere in Europe (well, in participating countries) and depending on the country and duration of travel can be relatively hassle-free. I personally don't like the Eurail pass because it's stupid expensive and they limit you to travel days. For example, you can get a pass that lets you travel 10 days within a month. When I was booking, that pass was $700. That's way too expensive. Check the pass prices very far in advance (a year or so before your trip) to see if the costs are more reasonable, and check which countries your pass is valid in. Without the Eurail pass, trains are generally maybe 20 euro or so more expensive than buses but are faster and more often on-time. For short distances (e.g. Genoa to Cinqe Terre) costs are low and are absolutely the most recommended method of travel. These rail lines are more local than regional so your Eurail pass would not count for them.


*~ Regional transportation: Buses*


This is my preferred method of travel through Europe. Companies like FlixBus and EuroLines are dirt-cheap and go EVERYWHERE at many different times during the day. Book through their apps or websites and keep a copy of the ticket on your phone for them to scan. Keep in mind that the buses are sometimes late so don't make plans too tight around your arrival time. 95% of the buses (at least with FlixBus) have charging outlets and wifi, though the wifi doesn't work sometimes. The drivers typically don't speak English either so be ready for that. The closer you get to departure time, the more expensive the ticket, so book at least a day in advance if you can.


*~ Regional transportation: Planes*


I'd suggest avoiding planes altogether unless you need to get across a huge chunk of land in a reasonable amount of time. The reason for that is almost entirely scenery, hassle, and comfort. Airports suck, let's be real. Bus or train stations are better. You can get there closer to when you depart and often have more room on board with plugs and wifi. However, having said that, flights can often be stupid cheap for large distances because of how many budget airlines are in Europe. Keep in mind that these are the definition of budget - you get *nothing* aside from a seat with a basic ticket. Often you won't really get any leg room either. I'm a little biased, but in all honesty a 2.5 hour flight from Budapest to Paris is probably better than a 24 hour long FlixBus ride.
 
 
**Hostels vs. AirBnB vs. Hotels**


*~ Hotels*


Everyone knows hotels. Private but expensive. I'd only suggest hotels for downtime where you want to be alone to recharge and get a solid night's sleep. You can book hotels last minute but this will likely leave you getting a room that is not ideal for your needs, or in a shitty location. I'd suggest booking hotels at least 3 days in advance.


*~ AirBnB*


These are best for groups. Splitting an AirBnB with others can often be cheaper than paying individually for a hostel. It's not unheard of for people to meet others in hostels then finish their stay in the city at an AirBnB together. Generally you need to book these a little in advance. Last minute bookings will give you few good options in most cities. I'd suggest booking maybe 4-5 days in advance minimum.


*~ Hostels*


These are the prime choice for solo travellers because of the cost, but also the social community (more on that under the ""meeting people"" section). Some European hostels can get as cheap as 8 euro a night (that was the cheapest decent quality one I had) and sometimes lower. 99% of them have wifi. Some things to look for when you book are free or cheap in-hostel meals, in-hostel laundry, and good reviews. Unless you book specifically en-suite and/or private rooms, keep in mind that the entire place is communal (shared). That means you're sharing bathrooms with a shitload of people and will be sleeping in dorms with anywhere between 4 and 16 beds (most commonly). Hostels typically have common areas where people hang out, and usually (at least in Europe) have kitchens for you to use with public pots/pans/plates/appliances/etc. They sometimes organize events like pub crawls or day trips themselves to really establish that community. Party hostels are the same as regular hostels but geared around the idea of huge daily partying. The nightlife at party hostels is wild. They usually serve alcohol in-hostel and do a lot of their own nightlife events. If you need to catch up on sleep I wouldn't recommend party hostels. For booking, I've personally booked hostels the day I planned on staying there. I saw a lot of people who didn't even book either, they'd just show up and hope for a bed. Ideally, book 1-2 days in advance.


**Food**


Not much to say here. If you have access to a kitchen, take advantage. In hostels you'll usually be able to use food from a ""free"" box if they have one, and if they don't, they sometimes have public spices and oil for people to use. Minute rice is great for hostels and so is pasta. If you make enough of it, sometimes you'll be able to find a few people who are willing to trade something or buy a bowl :) Giving out free dinner is also a really good way to make new friends. Lastly, KEBABS! Kebab shops are everywhere in Europe. They're some of the cheapest food you can find and are delicious and (mostly) healthy.


**Laundry**


A lot of hostels will have in-hostel laundry machines, or a service that can do it for you. Watch for pricing though. They usually charge a lot. Don't be afraid to look up a local laundromat and do it there instead. A huge chunk of laundromat and hostel machines provide soap automatically, or they'll give you some when you buy the machine time. If you're feeling especially thrifty, you can do your laundry in the sink and hang up your stuff to dry either in your room or outside if the place has a clothesline. I did my laundry once with handsoap. It worked well!


**SIM cards**


I went 3 weeks without a SIM card and wish I got one sooner. The amount of times I got lost was really quite astonishing. Data plans are pretty cheap in Europe depending on where you go. You could write an entire guide on how to take advantage of local deals. Pricing (even with the same company) is highly dependent on country. You can get some pretty good deals in the UK for instance, and the same plan in Hungary will cost you twice as much. I'd suggest just biting the bullet and hopping into a Vodafone shop and getting the plan that suits you best. Other carriers I'd suggest are O2 and Orange. Ask them which countries your plan works in before buying. Remember that thanks to Skype/Facebook/WhatsApp/Google Hangouts you can call people using data. Also, as a tip, if you have access to a computer and a gmail account, you can use the gmail phone to call anywhere in the US or Canada totally free, from anywhere. Click the little phone icon in the left bar of gmail to access that feature.


**Language**


English has definitely become a sort of lingua franca in Europe. Not everyone speaks it, but a loooot of people do. It's obviously an advantage to speak multiple languages (I speak English and French, and my French came in handy). I'm not suggesting learning new languages for your trip, but you should at least know a phrase or two. E.g. in Germany/Austria/Switzerland, ""Sprechen Sie Englisch?"" (""Do you speak English?"") goes a long way.


**Meeting people**


You have to be pretty socially lacking to not meet anyone, or staying exclusively in hotels. Just remember that everyone is in the same boat as you in hostels. 90% of those people are solo travellers and looking for friends. Just sit down and say ""how's it going?"". You'll find after some time that you'll have the same small talk openers to get comfortable with someone. They're usually along the lines of ""where are you from?"" and ""where have you travelled so far?"". Easy! Free walking tours are also a great way to meet people. More on those in the ""What to do?"" section. I'd suggest doing events organized by your hostel (meals are good) or finding local events for tourists (restaurant tours, pub crawls, club nights, etc.) for meeting people as well. Common areas are key here too. If your hostel has a shitty or no common area, you might have a harder time, but most hostels do pretty well in this department. Personally, whenever I got to a new place, it always felt like ""this is the place where I won't meet anyone"" but that was never the case. Just be friendly, be approachable, and don't be afraid to start a conversation.


**What to do?**


I can't tell you that! But, I can tell you how to find stuff to do. Google is great, obviously, but aside from that you should take advantage of the knowledge your hostel/hotel staff have. You can also pop by a tourist information office. It's literally their job to give you options on what to do. European cities practically always have free tours available as well. Ask around about those, or Google ""Free walking tour [city]"". They're typically high quality and the guides have lots of info to give on the city you're in. They can be used as a resource for finding other things to do as well so keep that in mind. Personally, the first thing I did in any new city was a free walking tour. They're also terrific for meeting people as I mentioned in the above section. Very important: **do not feel like you have to always be doing something!**. I actually highly suggest taking breaks every now and then for an entire day, two days, or if you're travelling a while, an entire week! Just lounge around the hostel and take it easy. 


**Don't worry, be happy**


Something will go wrong. Your plans will fall apart, you'll miss a bus/train/plane, but life goes on. You'll figure it out and keep going on your trip. This *is* where being flexible comes in handy, however. As mentioned at the start of this guide, planning will make your adventure rigid. Missing a bus could potentially really screw things up. Being flexible grants you the ability to change anything at any given time so a missed bus is no big deal. You may feel anxious or stressed about where to go, what to do, if you'll meet people, if you'll have fun...Just remember that you're abroad to enjoy yourself. Everything will fall into place. Personally, I had extremely bad anxiety my first week of travelling. Not sure what the source was, probably just a mix of everything. It was my first hostel experience, first solo travel experience, nothing was planned, so it was stressful for me. After that week though I realized that nothing had gone wrong and I was worrying about nothing. The trick is honestly to just stick it out and try to remember that your trip is for you and that you're there to experience different places and different people. As long as you're doing that, you're succeeding.

Is it a quality experience? Are my worries groundless?

I'm trying to book a flight from Europe to South America. The search engine keeps throwing up results that include American airlines like United and Delta (and a stopover in the US). They are accompanied by warnings that American officials have strict rules about filling in forms in advance.

I don't travel on these American airlines ordinarily. Is there something I should know? Are all three airlines roughly the same?

13,Questions about a layover in London,1,diqa6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/diqa6b/questions_about_a_layover_in_london/,40,1571265870.0,"Hi!

Sorry if these are ""dumb"" questions, I've just never travelled internationally alone/as an adult before. I'm 20F, and travelling solo from the US to Germany (Frankfurt) over thanksgiving. I'll be flying out of the US at around 4pm on a Friday, landing in Frankfurt (after a layover in Spain), around 11am on Saturday. Then I'm in Frankfurt until the following Friday!

Initially I was going to fly out of Frankfurt early Friday, then have a short layover at Heathrow before flying straight back to the US. However, my flights were changed! I now land in Heathrow at about 8:20am, and then my connection isn't until 5:20pm. I'm flying British Airways into Heathrow, and my flight home is on American Airlines. 

I really really want to leave the airport and see London, as I've never been! I was planning on taking public transportation around London and just exploring for the few hours. I just have a few questions about my layover :)

1) Will I need to get my checked bag from baggage claim if I'm leaving the airport? Or will it just be sent straight on to the US? I want to make sure I don't muck this part up. I'm fine with bringing them because if I do, I'll just use a luggage storage company! This is my most pressing question.

2) How much time should I allot at the airport for security and customs? I have TSA Precheck/Global Entry, but I'm not sure if it works in other countries? I only have used it travelling domestically and to the Caribbean before! I just want to make sure I give myself enough time at the airport. 

Thanks! Any recommendations for how to make the most of my layover are appreciated! :)","[""I'm jealous.  A few hours in London sounds amazing.  I'm a big fan of walking and just looking around, so  I'd take the regular underground to Waterloo Station and walk to Paddington Station where you can pick up the Heathrow Express back to the airport.   \n\nIf you start at Waterloo Station, you'll be able to see the Thames, Houses of Parliament, Leicester Sq, Soho, Oxford Street, and Hyde Park.  Depending on how much time yo want to linger in places vs how much ground you want to cover, you can add/take away stops.   \n\nJust beware it's easy to get lost in London.  I'd buffer my time at the end to make sure I can make it back to Paddington Station/Heathrow in case I end of walking in the wrong direction."", ""> 1) Will I need to get my checked bag from baggage claim if I'm leaving the airport?

It’s a fairly efficient airport but you can face long queues for check in and security if it’s a busy time. 2 hours is usually more than enough time but personally I wouldn’t do 1.5 hours for an international flight, as that’s very little buffer time. \n\nFor getting from Heathrow to central London you can either take the heathrow express (more expensive, faster) or just ride the Piccadilly Line (slower, cheaper), given your timeline I’d probably pick the former. Always good to be aware of both options though in case one is down/has delays', 'Take the London Underground’s (the “Tube”) Piccadilly line to Piccadilly Circus from Heathrow and just walk around and enjoy. Without major delays it’s about an hour trip each way. \n\nThe London Underground is pretty fantastic and a great way to get around London. I’d recommend getting a day pass from the ticket machines at Heathrow. (Machines will take a credit card or your bank debit card, but be prepared for some lines (“queues”). \n\nMake sure you leave LOTS of time to make the return journey — 90 minutes once you’ve returned to Heathrow plus figure at least an hour journey back from London, etc — manage your time smartly! \n\nHave a great layover!', 'Your bag should be checked though on the same ticket. Make sure you get your boarding pass for your AA flight when you check in at Frankfurt.\n\nNow. You\'ll be arriving into Terminal 5 heathrow. Leave the airport and follow the sign for ""Trains"" as you exit baggage reclaim/customs. Then you\'ll want the [Heathrow Express](https://www.heathrowexpress.com/) train. Buy a day return. You might also book the ticket in advance and get a better rate. Dont waste time on the underground, it takes ages.\n\nThis will then get you to Paddington Station and from there you can use the underground anywhere, use a credit card with the contactless logo on it, and tap it on the yellow pad of the entry turnstiles, and again when you exit. You MUST USE THE SAME CARD each time, use it all over london, underground, busses, whatever, there\'s a daily cap for the price so use it a lot. If your card doesn\'t work, go to the ticket office and tell them you want a 1 day travel card. You\'ll have to work out what you want to see, and plot a route with less important things at the end.\n\nWhen you\'re done with all this you\'ll head back to heathrow, but remember that AA leaves out of Terminal 3.\n\nIf you\'ve got your boarding passes already you\'re fine up to an hour before your flight. If not, then 2 hours is more then enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an additional note, Frankfurt is probably one of the most boring places on earth, and london one of the most interesting. Since the airline has messed with your flight times (I\'m assuming this is an AA ticket) they\'re usually quite accommodating in making changes if you call them and say it\'s not particularly suitable for you. I\'d find a cheap hotel take the same flight getting in at 08:20 but ask them to put you on the flight home to the US the following day in the evening, maybe the same 5:20pm flight, but a day later.

Some people might hate that. Me? I\'m just pumped to see London!\n\nI also love walking and looking around. I normally make a list of like 3-4 things I want to ""do"" or see while there.

I definitely am an ""err on the side of caution"" type person, so I\'ll definitely leave wayyy too much time on the return trip to the airport!

Thank you so much!', '> personally I wouldn’t do 1.5 hours for an international flight, as that’s very little buffer time.\n\nI regularly do 45 minutes for an ""international"" flight to Europe and 60 minutes to a long haul international.

So I booked through British Airways because it\'s all OneWorld so all the airlines work together. I fly Iberia on both legs on my way OUT to Europe, but then I fly British Airways from Frankfurt to London, then AA from London to home! \nI tried yesterday to see if I could change my flight to later at all because I really would love to spend more time in London. Unfortunately, because it\'s the multiple airlines, it\'s for some reason SUPER confusing. I always fly American and am pretty good about knowing how to change my flight etc. However, because some of my flights aren\'t actually American, and because I booked THROUGH British Airways, it complicates everything. Like, even on my Iberia and AA flights, I need to select seats through British Airways. And for some reason, I can\'t do it online, I need to call the offices and speak to someone to do it. So yesterday, I tried to change my flight home. You\'d think that because it\'s the one AA leg, it would be easy! Instead, I had to call British Airways and sit on hold for 30 minutes. Then when I got through, he told me that I was on the latest flight for the day and there was nothing they could do. I might try reaching out and seeing if there is an early morning flight the next day, but I\'m not sure what they\'ll do :( But you do make a good point about it being THEIR fault my flight was changed in the first plae!

My girlfriend and I are traveling to Thailand for a vacation in January. We prefer to fly American Airlines and it looks like they only fly to Bangkok, not Phuket where we need to be.

15,The 65+ Hours I Spent in AA Purgatory,120,4bsg3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4bsg3m/the_65_hours_i_spent_in_aa_purgatory/,39,1458867624.0,"TL;DR: Due to a combination of American Airline's (AA) incompetence and bad luck, including missing plane staff and an airport strike in Barbados, I still have not arrived to my destination and have spent over 86 hours on airplanes, in airports, and in shitty airport hotels. I was supposed to arrive at Barbados Tuesday afternoon, and my newest flight is scheduled Friday morning, and I'm still not convinced that it'll leave on time.

UPDATE: I MADE IT!! 86 hours later. Time to go give AA a piece of my mind... 

&nbsp;

EDIT: I consolidated some details and added updates at the end. If you enjoy stories that drone on and on, feel free to read below! I also realized that in spite of these inconveniences, I am very fortunate to be able to make the trips I am making. This is meant more as an angry rant and just me letting off steam.

&nbsp;

Buckle up kids, this is going to be long.

&nbsp;

My two month trip to South East Asia had come to an end. I spent time in Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and I was ready to go back and visit some friends from home. I had an overnight flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong, where I would catch a flight to Beijing in the morning and then arrive in Chicago. 

&nbsp;

The flight to Beijing was uneventful, but I was delayed a few hours. I arrived in Beijing around 6am local time, with my flight to Chicago leaving at 10:10am local time. Perfect, I thought - I have time to check in and rest a bit.

&nbsp;

I will start my journey at 8:30am Beijing time on March 22nd.

&nbsp;

*March 22nd, 12:30AM UTC. 8:30AM CST.*

*0 hours.*

&nbsp;

I am in line at the American Airlines (AA) check in counter, waiting for my flight AA186. As I'm moving through, I see a small piece of paper taped to the check in desk: 

> AA186 DELAYED UNTIL 17:40

Oh no. This is definitely some other AA186 flight, right? Don't tell me my flight has been delayed 7 hours. I get to the desk and ask, and they say to me:

&nbsp;

""Hello Mr. Wang, the flight has been delayed because the flight crew has not shown up. Additionally, since you are on an award ticket, I cannot place you on the 17:40 flight, and [will have to put you on the flight for the next day](http://i.imgur.com/c5plUG3.jpg)."" 

:|

Fine. My sleep deprivation and less than stellar Chinese skills cause me to just accept my fate. I go to the Hilton @ Beijing Airport and stay the entire day and night. I'm able to board my flight the next morning without a hitch.

&nbsp;

*March 23rd, 2:00AM UTC. 10:00AM CST.*

*25.5 hours.*

&nbsp;

I somehow got stuck with the middle seat in Economy on this flight. I find my left hand seat mate is a [rather large fellow](http://i.imgur.com/FJ8TeZC.jpg). No worries, he's nice and I am a pretty skinny guy myself so I don't mind too much, as long as the guy to my right isn't taking up too much space. As soon as I think this, almost on cue, another gentleman who was at least 30% larger than the one on my left starts walking down the aisle. I thought to myself, ""wow, wouldn't that suck if he sat next to me?"" At this point, I was still brave enough to tempt fate.

&nbsp;

Turns out, the fellow walking down and the man to my left know each other. The man walking down is scanning the row numbers, until his eyes narrow on…

&nbsp;

My row.

&nbsp;

As he squeezes in to his seat, I am faced with a dilemma, I try to squeeze my shoulders in, but I am stuck between these two men and I have no space to myself, literally touching their shoulders, no matter how I contort myself. I contemplate crying, or asking to switch seats, or both. As I’m trying to decide the best way to hide my tears, an angel with blonde hair and a blue AA uniform walks down and asks the man to my right if he would like to move to a more comfortable seat, as, she says, “it looks a bit cramped in here.” She must have sensed the desperation in my eyes - either that or the nervous sweat that was now accumulating in my armpits. 

&nbsp;

He moved, I sat on the other aisle seat, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Little did I know that this was an omen, a sign of worse to come.

&nbsp;

*March 23rd, 3:30PM UTC. 10:30AM EST.*

*39 hours.*

&nbsp;

We land in Chicago and I run to catch my flight to Miami. 

&nbsp;

I get to the gate, it’s a long process to board the plane since the overhead compartments are smaller than normal and people are struggling to fit their luggage in. As soon as everyone is done and settled in, we hear an announcement.

&nbsp;

“Sorry folks, it turns out that the lavatories on board this aircraft are not functional. Due to FAA regulations, this plane cannot fly. We apologize for the inconvenience. Everyone must now deboard.”

&nbsp;

Cries of anger are heard throughout the plane. Why did they wait until everyone was on board and settled? The plane had been sitting at the gate for an hour, had no one gone and checked? Why do airlines suck? Of course, asking these questions is futile.

&nbsp;

The plane ends up taking off two hours later. 

&nbsp;

We land at MIA at around 5:15PM. My flight to Barbados takes off at 6pm so I'm not too worried. We hear the captain: “Sorry folks all the gates are full, we're currently trying to get you all an open spot. Should be about five minutes.” No problem, I still have plenty of time to catch my flight. 

&nbsp;

Five minutes go by. 

&nbsp;

Ten minutes go by. 

&nbsp;

It's 20 minutes until we hear the captain again. 

&nbsp;

“Sorry folks, the plane just left the gate. Should be another three to four minutes.”

&nbsp;

I know this game. We are the proverbial children on the car ride, asking “are we there yet? Are we there yet?” And the captains, just to appease us, keep saying “just five more minutes. No, I know it’s been five minutes - i meant five minutes from *now.*”

&nbsp;

Of course, the “three to four minutes” takes another 20 minutes. We finally start going to the gate. It’s too late, I’ve already accepted my fate - my plane takes off at 6pm, I get out of the plane at 6:10pm. I go to the ticket counter to get a new ticket, and the man tells me that the Barbados flight is actually right next door - and to run, since the plane is still there.

&nbsp;

It takes me ten seconds to run there. I get there and I see.

[This.](http://imgur.com/RnBSgVv.jpg)

This is my plane. They refuse to let me on because the door has closed. I don't even try to fight it since I know that there is no way they will let me on board. I am so close, yet so far. Fate had dangled a carrot in front of my nose, then pushed me down into the dirt, ate the carrot itself, and gave me a voucher to a shitty hotel along with its “sincere apologies”. 

&nbsp;

I use my meal voucher to order a chicken sandwich from Burger King. She rings it up and I am actually 30 cents short. I had to pay 30 cents for my crappy airport chicken sandwich.

&nbsp;

I get on a shuttle to my hotel and open up the Reese’s pie I had also ordered. [It turns out it was a hershey’s](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDUPpwogdG3/). This is the cherry on the shit pie - I wanted some god damn peanut butter, and I can’t even have that. I turn on Transformers 2 on the hotel TV so that I feel marginally less alone. I pretend Shia LaBeouf is my friend, but like everything else good in my life, we both know that he’ll entertain me for two hours and get up and leave without saying goodbye. 

&nbsp;

I wake up, eat the hotel breakfast, get on my shuttle, and get to the airport. I am 2 hours early, so I hit up the Centurion Lounge. [I get a rum and coke](http://imgur.com/Wp2gPx6.jpg) - even though it’s 7am here, it’s 6pm in Thailand, so technically I’m not an alcoholic. 

&nbsp;

*March 24th, 12:00 noon UTC. 7:00AM EST.*

*59.5 hours.*

&nbsp;

I finish up my meal and head to my flight. We board without incident. I am on edge, knowing something is going to be wrong. And, if you've read this far into my story, you can probably guess what's going to happen.

&nbsp;

We are informed by the captain that...
... the Air Traffic Control in Barbados is having a strike, and they have closed down the whole airport.

&nbsp;

He does not know how long we are going to be stuck. After half an hour of waiting, he tells us:

&nbsp;

""Uhh, folks, looks like we'll be departing a bit later than we planned. At least **four hours later.**"" 

&nbsp;

He gives us permission to leave this AA metal prison. I leave, go back to the lounge again, grab some lunch then proceed to get a free massage and very, very drunk.

&nbsp;

I was supposed to make it to Barbados at 9pm on March 22nd. It is now, if everything goes well, supposed to be 6pm on March 24th. 

&nbsp;

I have been defeated by AA.

&nbsp;

*March 24th, 5:30PM UTC. 12:30PM EST.*

*65 hours.*

&nbsp;

And, as you probably can guess, everything did not go well. The flight went from showing up as a boarding time of 2:30PM to being showed as ""cancelled"". I stood in line at rebooking for half an hour and turns out all flights are canceled because the airport in Barbados is still closed. I managed to be one of the very few people from the original 10am flight to get on the 10am flight for tomorrow, March 25th. The agent felt bad for me so she booked me, while there were 60 people on standby on that flight. The family next to me had their flight rebooked to Saturday - a full two days after. Unbelievable. This will add 21 hours to my ordeal, and I will be up to 86 hours in this cluster fuck. And yes, I'm staying another night in the same hotel.

&nbsp;

I realize that this is not all AA's fault. They couldn't have seen the Barbados strike coming, and it was procedure that I am not allowed on a plane that closed its doors. I have no problems with that. And to be fair, they did give me vouchers for food and a hotel. But I believe that should be the bare minimum. The two instances where I believe AA was at fault was in Beijing, where the airline staff just didn't show up AND because I booked an award ticket they pushed my flight a day back, and in Chicago, where they didn't have mechanics check to make sure the bathrooms were working. The plane had been sitting on the tarmac for an hour and no one bothered to check, causing us to be very late.","[""I'm almost impressed by how many unrelated things seemed to go wrong for you."", ""> I get a rum and coke - even though it’s 7am here, it’s 6pm in Thailand, so technically I’m not an alcoholic.\n\nI laughed here a little bit, but then realized the cloud of shit you've flown through and then felt sad.

By the 3rd day they took me into a small office and interrogated me as to why I've been living at the airport. I explained my situation and was free to go back to the terminal and wait for the next available seat. Nothing was offered. No hotel vouchers, no food or drink vouchers. Being broke (hence flying standby), I lived off of McDonald's and slept on plastic for 4 days. The only reprieve is that when I finally got a seat it was in business class.

Its the middle of Feburary, freezing (and I only brought tropical clothes) and even though it would take 30-40 minutes to get a hotel (and thus back meaning the 6 hour layover would only afford at most 2-3 hours of sleep) I try to call around to get a hotel room. No dice. Major conference means all nearby hotels are sold out. And since the airport is officially closed, there are no taxis. I ended up sleeping in the entryway of a closed car rental agency, by tethering my newly acquired hammock to a bench and a pole, which didn\'t work out well, so essentially my but was on the ground, while my head and feet were slightly elevated.

All within arms distance from each other. She literally watched my by the OJ and didn\'t say anything. She must do this every day. I stood off to the side as I drank my juice. I watched a half dozen other poor souls buy their coffee, and get turned away. Many throw their drink out to get into the ""secure"" area before realizing there is no coffee on the other side. (Really people...you can see that there is nothing for sale, there aren\'t even bathrooms!) As it gets closer to takeoff time, I\'m still not through security. TSA Lady keeps saying if I don\'t go through I\'m not going to make it. (Again, lady, you manage security for one gate. There are no other people waiting in line to get through this gate.) I just calmly drink, and wait for boarding to start, and then go through security. She took her sweet time patting my down, asking if I had any other liquids, etc. Stupidest airport ever.

16,How to get escorted off a plane with United without doing anything wrong at all - it's a long story.,41,xqjhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xqjhh/how_to_get_escorted_off_a_plane_with_united/,36,1344239774.0,"All you need to know about me is this: I live in Upstate New York, I had a summer internship in Michigan, and I have family in Southern California.

Back in April I bought a round trip flight with United Airlines for my internship. The return flight to Syracuse (Grand Rapids-Cleveland-Syracuse) was scheduled for August 4. Then partway through the summer I decided to go to California with my family and bought a ticket for the same day, but
 it was cheaper to buy a new roundtrip flight through American Airlines than it was to change the United flight so I bought the California one (Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County) for later in the afternoon on August 4. I figured I'd meet up with my mom, say hi and give her some stuff I didn't need and then fly on to California.

So in the morning on Saturday August 4 I set out for Grand Rapids, checked in with United - they gave me both my ticket for Cleveland and for Syracuse, all ready to go - and in texting my parents I got this weird text from my mom - u r flying rite 2 cali. I had NO idea what she was talking about so I called her and she said, “Your Cleveland-Syracuse flight got canceled, United called the house yesterday and said they were going to call you.” I have no idea how they got my home phone number, and that hasn't been useful to me in over a year because I’ve been studying abroad and not home at all, but they never called me, never emailed me, nothing. So then my dad is calling them again while I'm trying to find someone in the godforsaken Grand Rapids airport - there is ONE person working there for United and he says he can't help me right now because he is boarding the Cleveland flight and I said no, you need to help me right now because I either need to get on this flight or not. And he won't help me so I leave and go back to the check-in desk outside of the secure area to get them to fix it.

I explain to the guy at the ticket desk what's going on, and he brings out a lady who must be higher up than him because obviously it's all too complex for him to understand. She says our contract with you is to get you to Syracuse not California. I say yes, but your contract was also to get me there at a specific time and you cancelled the flight that would get me there on time so I could make my next flight and get to Orange County. She says well we'll have American Airlines fix this for you and prints me an itinerary for American that says now Grand Rapids-Chicago-Syracuse and then I can get on my American Airlines flight - Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County. I say fine - they basically passed me off so that I can't yell at them and get anything else out of them - and go to the American desk. The man there is really nice and fixes it so I just go Grand Rapids-Chicago-Orange County. So I fly to Chicago and it's all sorted out.

My brother, sister, cousin and grandmother are also in Chicago, flying with United of all things, leaving a good 6 hours earlier than me, and I know that United owes me compensation for the canceled flight so I figure I'll try and get on that flight, I might as well try and save my grandmother a trip to the airport late at night. So I go to the customer service desk for United and there's a huge line and so I call customer service while I'm in the line. The woman I spoke with gets me exactly what I want, says my itinerary is now changed for Orange County and I just need to print my boarding pass for this flight at 3pm local time. I thank her and thank her saying she's the first person with United who's been any help to me all day. So I have the lady at the desk print it for me and I'm all set to go. I get on the plane, no issue, sitting a good 20 or so rows ahead of my family and right as we're about to take off a security woman comes down the aisle, addresses me by name and says, “You need to come with me. You have not paid for this flight and you need to be going to Syracuse. You cannot go to another state Orange County is in another state.”

And I said I know exactly where Orange County is and where Syracuse is but I've already sorted this out and I have my boarding pass, it's right here, United printed it out for me just 20 minutes ago. And she said no look and she points to four letters at the top of the ticket - PTKT - and says that makes it not valid and it means you haven't paid for this flight. I ask if anyone else was scheduled to be in this seat and she said no but you still can't sit there we can't take you to Orange County for free. I say you aren't taking me for free I paid you $420 for my flight months in advance. She says I need to go now and I figure I could get myself in much hotter water than I am already so I get my stuff and go.

So my family still hasn't noticed what's going on because they're so far back and I yell to my sister as I'm standing in the aisle getting my bag, ""HEY, I'll make it to California. ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT EVERYONE."" As I exit the plane I say to one of the stewardesses, “Would you mind at least explaining to my family why you've taken me off the plane? And then I'm standing in the jetway expecting to talk my way back onto the plane. The woman says I need to go to Syracuse. I said, “If you had actually done your homework you'd see that your company cancelled my flight from CLEVELAND, not Chicago, to Syracuse over 24 hours ago, and this is how the woman on the phone fixed it for me, because you ruined my travel plans and made it impossible for me to get from Syracuse to Orange County on time.” She kept saying ""Syracuse and Orange County are in different states"" and I said I KNOW. Then it started to dawn on me how long I'd been on the defensive, and I was tired and frustrated, and I burst into tears.

“You humiliated me in front of a hundred people, you took me away from my family, I haven't seen them in over a year between school and travel and work and I just want to go with them to see my aunt in California.” They escort me out of the jetway and I follow a guy in a dumb looking suit to the desk in front of the gate and say how are you going to fix this? And he says I'm printing you a boarding pass for Chicago-Syracuse. This gets me into Syracuse at 9pm. I say, “Have you not been listening to me? This is absolutely useless to me. My flight from Syracuse to CHICAGO is leaving at 4 pm IN ONE HOUR.” He said, “You'll have to figure it out with American Airlines from there. I tell him that I and other customers pay United an awful lot to be treated like livestock.” I take the boarding pass but go back to the American Airlines counter and ask if the boarding pass I was given in the morning, the one for Santa Ana at 6:50 pm, is actually a boarding pass and if I'll be able to get on the plane, and they say yes your boarding pass is valid. I say thank you and find a corner with some carpet and nap for a while, read a bit, and cry now and then because I'm just stressed out and tired of being alone.

That flight is delayed about an hour but sure enough I get on the plane and it leaves the ground without anyone coming on and making a fool of me. I get into California around 10pm West Coast time - I have now been awake for almost 20 hours - and my aunt picks me up and takes me to the house where I pass out on the couch for the night. Now I’m with family and I’m glad to be, but I want justice. I want to spread this story and give United Airlines the publicity it deserves, and I hope the Internet can help me out with that.

*Maybe if I was an Olympic athlete, they would have treated me better?*

**TL;DR: I tried to get my flight changed with United Airlines after they cancelled one of my flights, they printed me a boarding pass and I got on the plane, they escorted me off saying I hadn't paid.**","[""OP, you had an angel looking over you. If you had been on the United flight from chicago to SoCal, you could have been completely boned. \n\n\nOk, I have had similar had problems with United and other airlines. The root of the issue is your ticket so lets start there.\n\nYou have two tickets one to SYR and one to SNA. Those tickets are on UA and AA respectively. Separate but attached to the tickets are the reservations on specific flights.\n\nNow for whatever reason UA cancels one of your flights. This has the effect of killing your unprotected connection (unprotected connections are connections on two different tickets). Now, UA reroutes you on AA into SYR. You get to ORD and ask the UA agent to reroute you from SYR to SNA so you can short circuit your trip into SNA. \n\nHere's the problem when you spoke to phone agent she changed your reservation from SYR to SNA. However, she didn't change the ticket. your ticket still said SYR. So the agent when she pulled off the plane was technically correct. though this should have been caught before you got on the plane. If the agent actually had changed the ticket and not just the reservation, the system would have demanded the add collect for the ticket change fee $150.00 plus any change in fare.  \n\nHowever, you were actually very lucky. If you had stayed on the flight to SNA and you missed your AA flight out of SYR, AA would have canceled your return flight. You have to take the outbound of a round-trip ticket or have a really good reason to miss it in order to keep AA from canceling it. You would have been real surprised to find out when you to the airport for your return trip to find your ticket was canceled. Then you would have had to buy a much more expensive walk-up ticket home. \n\n(I actually did this once, the end result was me renting a car in the Miami airport and driving to Atlanta.)\n\ntl;dr. UA didn't change the ticket, just the reservation. However the horrible service provided saved the OP's butt from being stranded in Southern California. "", ""I've never had a decent flight experience with United.  First it was a delay from New Jersey to North Carolina during clear skies and while Southwest and Delta were still flying out.  Then it was bumping me to an alternate flight and giving me a $250 voucher, when their flights are at least $400, so I can't even get a decent value out of it.  The last straw was a flight attendant telling me my bag was too big to be a carry on (I check at the gate to save money) and insisting she shouldn't let me check the bag as policy states.  I avoid United and American at all costs.  I'll fly Southwest and Jet Blue whenever I'm given a choice."", ""Every time I fly with United I have a bad experience. Actually anytime I fly with any airline other than Virgin America , Southwest or Jet Blue I have a bad experience. I don't understand how these airlines are still in business"", ""I'd love to see a United rep try to explain this somehow."", 'Aww, that sucks.  I had something like that this week - I was coming home from a study abroad, and my travel agent (that I had to go through) had me fly into JFK and then my next flight was at LaGuardia.  By the time I got off at JFK though, I had already been up for like 30 hours so after going through security when the lady asked if I had a connecting flight, I said yes, and put my stuff on the baggage drop like she said.  Of course, since I had to fly out of another airport, that was not the right thing to do.  Definitely my own fault, but there was crying at the airport because of that.\n\nBut luckily it was with AA, so they dropped my bags off at my house for free (a day later, albeit at 2am) and it saved me the trouble of switching airports with a shit ton of baggage.', 'United is the Greyhound bus with wings.', ""I have NEVER had a good experience flying with United.

I call them, they say I need to fix it at the desk. I go to the desk and nobody knows what I am talking about, let alone how to fix the problem.\n\nI hope they reimburse you and hook you up with some free flights, but if they don\'t at least you never have to set foot on one of their planes again.', 'I\'m sick of airlines abusing passengers. I hear more and more stories like this, and it frustrates me to no end b/c the airlines are in complete control: They have our money, we are stuck in the airports with nowhere to go and no other way to get there, so we are at their mercy.\n\nThis is just ONE example of how we have been abused by an airline: When we were headed to California for a wedding two years ago (10 of us in all), our flight was delayed taking off. We still had time to catch our connecting flight, however, so we hurried to the gate--only to find that it had boarded and left EARLY (who ever heard of such a thing???)--with (at least) 10 empty seats--seats that we had paid for months in advance. When we tried to make arrangements to catch another flight, they had room for only five, so my in-laws and their friends took that flight. My husband, our three children, and I were out of luck--wouldn\'t get out until 24 hours later. I told the agent that it was unacceptable--we had paid for our tickets/seats (on another flight!), and we needed to be flying out that day. He looked at my husband and pointed at me and said, ""I am NOT dealing with THAT."" I was a ""THAT""??? I wanted to snap his finger off and ram it down his throat! We went to another ticketing counter and managed to find someone slightly more accommodating and less rude. However, it wound up costing us a lot more money because we had to fly in to San Diego, rent a car, and drive to Newport Beach, not to mention that it was very late at night after a ridiculously long day (23 hrs).\n', 'fuck united they treated me like shit when I flew with them.  ', 'My parents and I got fucked on United too I feel your pain.', '[deleted]', ""That is correct. You can't skip segments without automatically cancelling your itinerary.

Still, their service sucked.\n\nYou shoud be the top post, no doubt."", ""I agree, after working for many years in the airline industry particularly dealing with complicated ticketing issues - this poster has it spot on.  The moral of this whole story is do NOT buy tickets on separate airlines (that are not in an alliance).  If you do...and one flight is delayed or cancelled...you are screwed.  The OP said they argued that they had a contract to get to a city at a particular time..that's actually incorrect.  The contract of carriage most airlines use specify travel between Point A and Point B - but nowhere does it specify time.  It probably should because a lot of people end up getting screwed by things like this...but it doesn't.."", ""Usually I'm of the opinion that all airlines treat their non-gold-first-elite-superawesomerich-classes equally, so I always just go for what's cheapest when I buy, but I can now see a CLEAR difference in service between at least United and American."", ""The reason is that they are still in business is that Jet Blue, Southwest and Virgin America don't really fly outside the US. Jet Blue flies to the carribean but that's it.  While that's fine if all of your travel is done domestically its not a problem, it is however if you fly to Europe, Asia South America etc.  \n\nUnited and American rely on lots of business travelers most of which have lots of status and are loyal to one airline and don't book things the way you did.  \n\nsimply the nature of the beast. If your not a regular traveler I'd suggest sticking to Southwest/Virgin America.  "", ""Used to work at a call center for American a few months back before I escaped. The fact is, NOBODY there views flying as any form of service anymore. They view it as something that people should be grateful we provide, considering without them, folks would have to drive or take rail. By being so large and impenetrable, these businesses have developed one hell of a god complex. And it's tragic that it's spread through the entire company, in ALL of the companies. "", 'I\'m not a United rep, just a frequent traveler, but I\'ll try:\n\nUnited cancelled the CLE-SYR flight.  It sucks, but is happens.  Now, the terms of contract for the airlines are very complicated, but they are under no obligation to get you to your destination at a specific time.  This is why it is best to not book flights on different reservations close together.  In fact, if the cause of the delay is outside of the airlines control (i.e. weather), they can just cancel your reservation and return your money.\n\nIn most cases, the airlines do their best to figure out some way to get you to your destination, including securing mutual agreements with other airlines to use seats on their planes if they need to re-book cancelled passengers.  United, American, Delta, and US Air all have agreements between them to do this. (Note, Southwest, and I believe JetBlue, do not have these agreements, so they are on their own when they have a problem, like JetBlue did a few years ago).\n\nSo when the first United agent sent the OP to American, it was under this agreement.  ""Hey, this passenger needs to get to Syracuse.  Can you squeeze her in on one of your flights going there?""  The American rep was able to do so, and did.\n\nNow, next is where the problem arises, at least as I see it.  The flights to Syracuse and the flights to Santa Ana are still two separate reservations despite both being on American.  OP paid United to get to Syracuse, which through mutual agreement American is doing, and she paid American to get to Santa Ana.\n\nThe American agent should not have combined your two itineraries.  American only controls the reservation from Syracuse to Santa Ana.  If they changed that reservation to Grand Rapids to Santa Anna, OP might have been fine, but I suspect they changed the first reservation (Grand Rapids to Syracuse on United) to Grand Rapids to Santa Ana on American.  He likely then cancelled the second reservation.  As an American agent, he could change the American reservation, but not the United one.\n\nNow, when OP calls the United agent on the phone, she has no idea of any of the back story.  She just sees Grand Rapids to Santa Ana on American under an original United reservation.  This may seem strange, but she sees no reason to not switch that to a United flight, so she does.\n\nNow where are we.  OP paid United to go from Grand Rapids to Syracuse, but is going from Grand Rapids to Santa Ana.  OP also paid American to go from Syracuse to Santa Ana, but that reservation is now cancelled (with AA keeping the fare).  In the end United is now flying OP across the country on the fare for a regional flight.  I can see where United would have a problem with that.\n\nThis isn\'t to say the OP did anything malicious.  The airlines screwed up (I would choose to blame American more than United), but every person along the chain acted in good faith.\n\nHow to avoid this in the future?  Well to start don\'t book flights on two different reservations for the same day.  Always assume your flight will be late.\n\nWhen needing to change flights, I have found two things that work:\n1) If you can get to a gate agent or ticket counter employee early, be nice, explain the problem, and most will bend over backwards to help you.  If you go up to them yelling or when they have a line of 40 passengers wanting their flight changed too, they won\'t be as willing to help.\n2) If there is a huge line, call up the reservations number.  This gets you back to the 1-on-1 relationship you want so they can explore lots of options.', ""That's really unfair.\n\nThey clean the buses every so often, and there's no TSA harassment."", 'How did you all fit in the United bathroom? Those things are super small', 'That is a pathetic response. \n\nThe OP has every right to be upset with the appalling treatment received if the description is accurate.\n\nSize and complexity of the company is no excuse for their abject failure to communicate adequately both with the customer and between their own employees.  \n\nYour comparison with the past is simply irrelevant and ludicrous. \n\nI hope the OP gets a suitable compensation from the company, but I doubt it will happen.', 'That would be a good response if the only 2 choices available were covered wagon or United.

In retrospect I know I shouldn't have booked for the same day but I really wanted to get into California to be with my family and spend as much time with them as I could. The other problem I encountered was just FINDING anybody to help me. They have a lot of those auto-check-in machines but I don't know why they don't have that many real employees hanging around the gates. The American rep in Grand Rapids definitely acted on good faith, as well as the United rep on the phone, and then from there people were just rude and unhelpful (especially after I started crying - and that's something I try not to do when I'm trying to get something resolved - but after I started crying the man at the gate desk and the woman who pulled me off the plane were just completely unresponsive)."", ""Sounds like if the airlines gave their agents' information systems some more intelligence it would really improve the average customer experience."", 'Hanging my head in shame... you are right.', 'it was very hard ( no pun intended) but it was done.', 'Yep...I never have problems like this flying with non-US airlines.', 'As much as possible, yes.

Let them know that you aren't complaining about the flight being cancelled, and understand how it is possible the American agent screwed up, but that the way you were treated by the United personnel (both the lack of availability of agents and the rude treatment you were given as a boarding pass holding customer) is unacceptable.\n\nThere was an AMA linked to on here by an airline booking agent and she said the airlines take customer service very seriously and will look to give you vouchers or upgrades to keep your business.  Gas cost the same for the airlines.  Weather is the same for all the airlines.  Customer service is one of the few differentiaters, so they take complaints very seriously."", ""Unfortunately its not just technology, but training for gate agents, and there are just too many of them to train to be experts in re-booking flights.  At the hubs, you've probably noticed that re-booking isn't handled by gate agents anymore.  They now have dedicated re-booking areas where customers are sent.  Not only does this consolidate all the problem travelers into one place, but the agents who work there are specially trained to do the re-bookings.\n\nThe smaller airports just can't justify this cost.  Often, the people who check in customers are the same ones working the gate.  Heck, I've even been boarded by baggage handlers at small airports.  Consolidating operating hours and keeping a minimum staff is the only way the airlines can keep routes to some small airports profitable.  Unless the travelling public decides they want to pay more to fly from remote airports, expect more automation and continued staff reduction at those airports."", "">gave their agents' information systems some more intelligence\n\nthey would also need to give the agents some intelligence (rather, intellect) for this to be worthwhile."", ""I'll be sure to take this up with them."", ""That sadly explains a lot for me personally.

17,WARNING: Don't book American Airlines using Expedia! NEW sneaky AA Policy in effect for those who don't buy from AA directly!,0,4jiw49,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4jiw49/warning_dont_book_american_airlines_using_expedia/,35,1463388996.0,"I recently booked an American Airlines ticket using Expedia.com.
(From Los Angeles LAX to Chicago - ORD)

It was booked several weeks before I flew.  About a day after I booked it on Expedia, I logged into the American Airlines site (to make sure I was getting my miles, and also to pick my seats).

On the flight out I saw that a seat had been assigned to me (and here is the messed up part) I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE IT.
..which was a drag as it was a dreaded middle seat, way at the back of the plane.

I called Expedia and they said yes... that with AA ONLY the airline can allow me to change seats, that there was nothing they could do.

I then called AA, and they said sure... there are plenty of available seats, but I either had to pay AA a fee to change my seat (since I bought from a third party site).

AA said if I had purchased on AA.com then I would have been allowed to change my seats.

AA also said that there was nothing I could do, and that I could request a new seat AT THE AIRPORT, but not before (and even then, no guarantees).

Even worse than this, my return flight did not even assign me a seat, and that I was told that I would not even know what my seat was until i got to the airport.

So basically, AA has a new policy, if you dont buy your tickets from them you can NOT choose your seat, and you cant even request a new one (or in some cases even know what your seat will be until you get to the airport).

IF I HAD KNOWN THIS WAS THE CASE I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT THE TICKET!

So, when dealing with third party sites like Expedia, make sure that you avoid American Airlines (unless you enjoy being squished into a middle seat, or unless you love the mystery of not being allowed to know where you'll be sitting until after you've gotten to the airport)

Expedia should have notified me (obviously)

and as I will continue to use Expedia and similar sites for their (often) cheaper prices, I will be avoiding AA as long as they have this policy in effect.

p.s. Of course, AA will allow me to ""upgrade"" and pay more for the ""fancy seats"" but they purposefully give third party ticket buyers on their flights crummy seats, and wont allow them to switch (even when there are plenty of empty seats otherwise available).

20,Was not allowed to board flight for calling the manager a bitch - Etihad,0,8v5aya,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8v5aya/was_not_allowed_to_board_flight_for_calling_the/,33,1530424826.0,"Hi guys

So today I had an international flight on Etihad

I was at Toronto Airport waiting to check in my 2 large baggage, and they told me that my carry on bag was to big

This was shocking to me because I've used this same carry on bag with multiple airlines to multiple destination over 5 years. This was my first time with etihad

They asked me to put my bag in a container, and if it did not fit I could not take the bag

My bag fit mostly, except 2 of the wheels were sticking out slightly maybe by 2-3 inches. They told me I still couldn't take the carry on baggage, my only options were to check it in for $320, or not take it at all 

The employees all told me that if it were up to them they would let me through, but they would get in trouble by the manager

After lots of arguing with the very rude and obnoxious manager lady, she would not budge. I told her that she was very rude, and this was no way to talk to customers

I decided to break off the wheels from my bag so it would fit in the countainer. After lots of struggle the wheels final came off and my bag fit in the package. I was left with a large scratch on my finger, and blood all over my clothes after ripping off the wheels.

The manager still wasn't going to let me take the carry on bag with me, even though it now fit in the container. Final after more arguing she hesitantly allowed me through so I could check in my other 2 bags. 

After going to check in my luggage, she started taking pictures of my bag and me for some reason. I tried blocking my bag so she couldn't take a picture, and she said ""too late"" and some other snarky comments. I then let her know that she was a bitch. I know I might of went to far with this comment, but this ladies attitude to a paying customer drove me crazy. Everyone else in the line also had problems with her, and several arguments occured. People were defending me when she would not let me take in my carry on bag, and everyone was saying how insane this situation was. Multiple people in the line were not allowed to bring there check in baggage because they were slightly two large.

After caller her a bitch, she said I was no longer travelling with them and that my flight would be cancelled with no refund. 

All because I called her a bitch

She called over security/police, and after explaining my side of the story the sided with me and said that the manager went to far by cancelling my flight, but there was nothing they could do. 

What should I do in this situation? I called American Express to try and get a refund, but they need proof that my flight was cancelled and I did not receive and proof at all. 

Some observers came to me who saw the whole thing, and said that the manager went to far, and that she was very rude and unpleasant. 


Now I am out $1800 for the original ticket, and had to purchase a new ticket for tommorow costing me $2500

21,Scheduling flights to and from Italy (via Chicago) in June 2018: is this the cheapest way?,8,7j2hhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7j2hhe/scheduling_flights_to_and_from_italy_via_chicago/,31,1513031149.0,"My husband and I are going to Italy in mid-June 2018 for two weeks. We would be flying into Rome, and out of Milan (via Chicago). In my comparisons, I have found it's cheaper to fly into somewhere like London, then to book a separate flight into Italy (these flights are averaging around $100). 

Note that for the long-haul flight, I'm sticking with airlines like United, British, American, as opposed to budget. Once we're in Europe, it's whatever is cheapest.

Does anyone have any experiences (good or bad) booking a bunch of separate flights? Am I any more or less likely to run into coordination issues? As I've been choosing flights, I've been giving us several hours between to account for delays.

Any thoughts would be helpful.

Thank you!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your responses and advice. I've tried several combinations of round-trips, one ways, multi-city, whatever and this is the cheapest I've found with a good schedule.

The US embassy in Paris is closed. My family member is a dual citizen of both Canada and the US. Would it be possible for this person to return to the US with her Canadian passport? I don't think there will be any time to get some new documents from the US embassy in Paris before the plane departs.

She has digital copies of all her identity and passports on-line and can easily make copies of them if that helps. She lost her wallet (which had the US passport), but her Canadian passport was stored in her bags which is why she still has it.

However, most redditors think she won't be denied entry to the US. I have told my relative to go to the airport and attempt to board the plane anyway. The call center might not know what they are talking about. I will report back what happens.

I dropped them off at the airport exactly at 4:55am, and thinking that the first flight leaves at 6:25am. Keep in mind that Omaha Eppley Airfield is really small. It normally takes 25-30 minutes to get from drop-off to your gate. They first tried checking in through American Airline Kiosk but it took 20 minutes to be notified on the screen that they couldnt check-in bags there. Now they had to be on the back of the line of atleast ten servicemen going TDY to be checked in. At that time, we thought we still have time to reach boarding. They reached the desk at 5:42am but were informed that they couldnt be checked in anymore for their first flight which leaves at 6:02am. It was my family mistake thinking that they leave 6:25am but it happens. I'm positive that there was no call announcement for them either. 

What to do now? Second leg was scheduled  to leave at 12:32pm from Chicago to Korea. There were 13 available seat for flight to Chicago at 9:00pm. Buying a one way ticket to there wouldve let my family reached their second flight. American Airlines wasnt able to get our itinerary back.

 Business class with American Airlines RT - either Paris, London, or somewhere in Italy (depends upon the prices when I actually purchase soon). Eurail tickets are on sale with extra free days, so looking to use rail transport for vast majority of the trip. Probably will go with First Class to avoid most of the bustle on trains.

 Definites: England, Scotland/Ireland, France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and some part(s) of Scandinavia.

 Maybes: Greece, Netherlands, Spain.

 Not a hostel person, should be able to get about 20-24 days free accommodation through Airbnb with credit card points (Airbnb gift cards).
Happy to purchase groceries regularly, go out to eat only once a day or less, love to see the sights. I'll be out photographing often, as well :D I'm not a shopper, so not going to be setting aside for trinkets.

 Budget: $10,000-$15,000, all-inclusive.

 MY flight: ~$3100

 Spouse flight (Meeting up in September for a week) : ~$700

 Boutique hotel for a couple nights: ~$1160

 Eurail tickets: ~$1000 (3 months)

 Set aside for reservation fees: $200 or so?

 20-24 nights paid-for accommodation with Airbnb

 Thoughts? I know the formatting doesn't hold up when I post from my phone, my apologies =(

 ****Sorry I don't have an itinerary set in stone, have left it pretty open apart from some places/things I definitely want to see****


***Edit 3/28***
August-september for 58 days would significantly increase my day-to-day allowance, so I think I'll do that so I can go eat at more places, get a cheaper rail pass, and see more attractions :)","[""Impossible to know with this level of detail on budget.  In general I think Eurail passes are a poor idea, certainly not something to plan on unless you have an itinerary pretty fixed.  And remember now that taking budget airline flights also needs to be carefully considered in the cost-benefit of passes.\n\nOn a more abstract level, though, I think passes are generally a mistake because they promote a style of travel that isn't that compelling for a lot of people.  You're encouraged, because of the sunk costs of the pass, to engage in long distance, major city-to-major city travel. "", 'Without knowing a detailed breakdown, it\'s difficult to give specific feedback. \n\nSince you\'re a business/first style traveler, I\'m assuming you\'ll also prefer private AirBNBs. Even with 20ish free nights, you\'re still looking at >$3000 in accommodation charges. There really are some *very* nice boutique hostels with private rooms that could fit your bill and at the very least it may be worth looking into.\n\nOverall, does the 10-15k budget include the cost of two RT business class tickets? That\'s ~6k right there, a huge chunk of what you\'ve set aside. \n\nThe Boutique hotel estimate is also difficult without knowing what city you\'re planning on staying in and what ""a couple nights"" means- prices will vary widely depending on location. \n\n**Not** including your spouse\'s flight or meal expenses, but with $75/day set aside food/sights/misc. expenses, that puts your budget at $14200ish. That\'s a conservative estimate personally, I usually spend >$100/day myself. This also varies widely- northern Europe is quite expensive, so if you spend a lot of time in Scandinavia it could easily cost more.\n\nEchoing the other response, the Eurail pass may not be the best choice for you. You might prefer a car rental for some countries and unless you\'re frequently moving cities it\'s difficult to get the value out of the sunk cost + the reservation fees (and most trains in Northern Europe require them).\n\nedit: clarified ""two *RT* business class tickets""', ""Drop the business class and fly coach.

Car rentals aren't always the cheapest, but they make smaller towns and nature sights more accessible and you're not bound to train timetables. \n\nYou're right, one-way rentals sometimes have a hefty fee. In my experience, sometimes rental companies only charge the fee for dropping off in a different country, so planning an intra-country road trip can be quite affordable (which I did in Croatia). Other times, I've circular road trip where we began and ended in the same city (that time, we started in Paris, drove through Spain and Portugal, and then back to Paris).

29,American Airlines indifference to customers,0,4wqfmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4wqfmf/american_airlines_indifference_to_customers/,30,1470695682.0,"My family of four (me, my wife and my twin infants who are 20 months old) travelled from India in the wee hours of 25th Jan, 2016 on Qatar Airlines. My final destination was Austin, Texas where I was supposed to reach on 25th January, 8:40PM (CST). Our connecting flight was in New York through Qatar Airlines local partner, American Airlines. (Airlines that bear the name of the greatest country but do not live up anywhere close to average)
It took us close to twenty hours to reach New York (JFK airport). We were so tired by then and my kids were struggling with jet lag and hunger (They are habituated to Indian food and could not take any in the flight except some formula and milk). We were directed to American Airlines counter since the flight to Austin was cancelled due to snowfall two day earlier.
As is usually the case with international travel, we thought the airlines will provide us the accommodation and will put us through next immediately available flight. Boy, I was wrong. They have really cut throat people with no emotions dealing these cases. We were told that the next flight is not until next day and we should look for our own accommodation. Our whole baggage (5 check in bags and 4 carry on bags) was given to us and asked us to deal with it. I spoke to the lady addressing my case and pleaded her to provide the accommodation as that is not abnormal and I have two infants and whole baggage to deal with. As we did not plan on missing flight in New York, none of us had winter clothing. It was scary for all of us as that was the first time for all of us in New York City and do not know how to deal with two infants, the baggage besides being tired after the travel. My wife who was just surviving after dealing with babies in the flight broke down. She hit the breaking point. Then the lady who was addressing our case called her supervisor. Here comes another lady. She introduced herself as someone working for American airlines and she said something on the lines that she is related to customs as well. She kind of implied not to mess with her. Since I am on non-immigrant visa, maybe she thought adding “customs” to her introduction would scare me. She was outright rude and tried to drag us away by pushing our baggage carts away. She did not let us talk, has no respect for fellow human beings (us), obviously has no clue that she is talking to a foreigner who sees her as an ambassador of the greatest country and trying to use scare tactics on us. I told her that we paid American airlines to provide us the service and I am only holding her accountable as she is representing American Airlines. The reason I had to say this was, when I postponed my trip for a week, they charged me a bomb and now when I need them they are trying to scare us away. It looked as if we were begging for charity. I do not know what provoked her. She started yelling at us and treating us like we were her slaves. She said she cannot keep up with the drama without knowing what we went through in the past 20 hours. We asked her name and she was reluctant to spell it out for us. In her own words she was saying “CASE CLOSED, MOVE”. We felt insulted. My wife took her picture in the airport and we can share it with you if you would like to know who she is. The lady who initially addressed our case came to us and said sorry. This pissed me off because they do not know what sorry means and they use it as an escape path. I could see that in her eyes. To me, that sorry implied “FUCK YOU”. I asked her if she believes in Karma. She said yes. Then I looked away from her. Flight cancellation due to unfavorable weather is understandable, but the way we were treated is deplorable. In a way I am happy that my little munchkins did not make any sense of what happened.

Such a disgrace","[""Sorry, but this really just sounds like a rant, laced with dramatic storytelling aimed to elicit maximal sympathy. Airlines typically don't put you in hotels for weather delays.

Your comments on the name of the airline will not endear you to them and starts the conversation off poorly. Also, leave out the emotional bits. The CS agents aren\'t out to get you. They have a certain amount of power, but often not a lot. You be an ass or tell another sob story (trust me they will have heard every version of it) will make them gloss over and not want to use the upper limits of their power, or find a supervisor who can. Instead, just stick to facts not hyperbole, especially in what you want from them specifically. The only clear thing you ask for in this email is ""I request American airlines to change its name to something else as they do not live up to having the name of the world’s greatest country in its brand."" Is that really what you are asking for? You know that isn\'t going to happen. Instead use bullet points of the factual frustration points, and ask nicely for a resolution they can give you. Asking nicely for a refund or credit in the amount of your hotel lets them know what the starting place is. And lets the agent know you aren\'t just doing a bitch session, but you are willing to work with them on a proper resolution. \n\nIt is a good idea to use the above in your in-person interactions as well. You said ""She said she cannot keep up with the drama"" which makes me think you were incoherent or focused too much on telling a story to this agent, instead of being quick and factual of what your problems were and what resolution you wanted. \n\nNow you know that a hotel due to weather isn\'t likely to happen.

This will be my 7th time in 18 months. Typically I've flown with Lufthansa with a few other airlines mixed in occasionally (United/Canada/Brussels) Unfortunately military pay (hubby is stationed over there) doesn't allow for frequent international travel in anything nicer than economy. If you can imagine I'm feeling a bit worn with the monotonous 8-10 hour knee stiffening flights, and I'm feeling a bit tired of LH just in general.

* What I'm asking is, from your experience, for the long haul flights, (I couldn't really care less about the shorter ones) is Lufthansa economy, or United economy PLUS better? I've never taken United on a long haul so that one's new to me. I do know if it was between econo, and econo, I'd stick with Lufthansa, but is the infamous American airline worth the sacrifice for the leg room on a 9ish hour flight?

I do know that Lufthansa is implementing a new premium economy, but I can only seem to get it for the outgoing itinerary. The return will only let me book business, which unfortunately is not financially an option.  

Thanks in advance for your travel expertise!","[""If given a choice, I would select Lufthansa for sure, overall I've had much better experience on long hauls then on United, better food, drinks and service.  Overall just a better experience.  I personally don't find United Economy Plus to be worth the extra cost either. It's just a tiny bit more room.\n\n But keep in mind price, which really in your case is probably the biggest factor (it often is for me) and make sure the flight is actually a Lufthansa plane and not another airline booked under a code-share (United and Lufthansa are both Star Alliance)"", ""Any reason you're restricting yourself to UA/LH?"", 'United is a lottery, you never know what you are gonna get. They have improved for sure but chances are you could still find yourself on a plane with tight seats, crabby attendants and a small 14"" crt television that used to show colour... \n\nI have flown with them for long and short haul several times in the last few months. Short haul flight was great, new planes etc but the long haul flights were a mix of super old planes and simply old planes.', ""Check the aircraft for flying on UA. See if it's the newer/refurbed B767 or B777s. If so, I'd go with UA E+ for the leg room and seatback IFE.\n\nI flew on a LIS-EWR B757 which had the seatback IFE (not the old CO one) and it was pretty enjoyable."", ""British airways! :P  I'd vote Lufthansa.  I would never take domestic airlines for long haul flights due to their quality and service"", '[deleted]', ""If you are taller than 6'/180cm I would think the legroom may become much more important. Even then I'm 185cm and I would chooose LH (Well I'm a Oneworld guy, so IB or BA for my TATL) That said, if you can get into the LH premium economy it truly is a different travel class between regular economy and business, not like the U.S. Airlines' version of just adding a couple inches and being done with it."", ""I would fly with Lufthansa for one reason: A380\n\nIf you can make sure you're flying on one of those it will make your economy flight much more pleasant.\n\nreason being:\n\n1.  Quieter than most other long haul aircraft.\n\n2.  More room to wander about.  Also greater chance of empty seats so you can spread out (especially so if you reserve seats at the back of the plane)\n\n\n3.  Higher cabin pressure than most aircraft (other than the dreamliner) which helps mitigate effects of things like jet lag."", 'United long haul flights are pretty much the worst. I\'ve done it twice now, from LA to Melbourne return (14 hours to Sydney + 1 to Melbourne), and neither flight has offered seat back entertainment. Let me tell you, 14 hours is an extremely long time when all you have are gems like Beautiful Creatures and the remake of Footloose to entertain you. The food also left a lot to be desired -- there was a stretch of about ten hours where we were only given a wrapped sandwich, if we happened to be awake. The last flight I took with them I happened to get seated in Economy Plus because I booked through Expedia and couldn\'t check in online, and I wasn\'t super impressed with it. I would never pay for that ""upgrade"" - it really is just a few inches more space.

The flights I'm currently looking at are in fact flown by their respective companies. \nPersonally, I don't really eat much of the airline food to begin with, (picky eater, and a type 1 diabetic so I bring enough food to keep me happy) I also don't take advantage of the alcoholic beverages with LH, so that's not really a game changer for me.

I've run into some crabby attendants with Lufthansa as well. I'm never impressed with their short flights, but that's simply due to their lack of complimentary snacks lol."", ""I've never flown British Airways, what about them do you like?"", ""yeah, Turkish really is just a no go for me with this itinerary. I have medical issues, so I carry a lot of medical supplies and electronics with me, and really just need to get to where I'm going as quickly and as little fuss as I can, unfortunately. "", ""Thanks for your input! I just wonder about the space. My last 4 long flights the person in front of me has set their seat as far back as possible the moment they were able to and left it that way for the duration of the flight (except for meal time when the FA made them sit up) When they do that, I can't move my knees, or access my bag from under the seat (having it in the overhead isn't really an option since I need easy access to my medical supplies) I know that that's not the airlines fault, but I wonder if the extra space would be worth the sacrifice."", 'Most of this thread has been very anti UA. Did the trade of service for a little more leg room bother you at all?', 'I was wondering that, based on the mention of other *A airlines earlier in the post, but the specific mention of UA/LH surprised me a little.', 'Forgot to mention that all the flights I did were economy plus! I was expecting more... but love the luggage allowance!\n\nAs for snacks and drinks, I stock up in the airport nowadays, I know its expensive but its a much nicer experience to sit in your seat with a refreshing drink of your choice while the plane takes off and all the flight attendants are still seated for takeoff. And love that electronic devices are allowed during takeoff and landing, so much more enjoyable.\n\nHave a great trip! Im trying to get to Milan for a weekend soon myself...', ""I'm really not a fan of Lufthansa (even in business class it's pretty lackluster) so I don't see it as much of a tradeoff. \n\nWith United there are some truly crappy old planes and a few new ones. Seatguru.com will let you look up a flight number to see what it's going to be; that will help you make the most of your options. Sometimes moving to a later flight or a different connection will make the difference between a beater from 1950 with a puppet show for entertainment, vs a brand-new plane with video-on-demand and seats that don't smell like your weird uncle's bathroom carpet.\n\nThe crew on both airlines are unpleasant as airline crews go, and the food is nothing to write home about (again, even in business class).\n\nIf I really wanted an improvement I might fly KLM, Austrian, or if heading further east/south than Italy, Turkish Airlines. But transatlantic you don't have a lot of good options, so in your scenario you might as well go with the one serious distinguishing factor, which is going to be the legroom in UA economy plus."", ""haha now I'm confused! Your first post sounded like you don't recommend them, but your second one does O.o  Have you ever flown long haul on LH economy? A lot of people say that the food is better and there is free booze, but to be honest, I'm a picky eater, and type 1 diabetic so I take a lot of my own food anyway, and I don't drink on the plane, so those things are not game makers for me. I completely agree with you on having my own drink. I can't stand those tiny little cups when what I really want is a nice big chug of water. \n\nI also have an Ipad that I can load movies and shows onto, so even the in flight movies/screens aren't a big deal. \n\nAnd thanks! Have a lovely trip yourself! On my last journey the hubby and I took a trip to Venice and Florence. I haven't been to Milan yet, but I'm sure I'll get there eventually. (I highly recommend Florence over Venice though)"", ""After all of my traveling, I'm simply not a fan of ANY airline really. They all have their drawbacks. It just seems to me like the service from Lufthansa is going down hill, or maybe my perception has simply changed since all my major traveling started. I frequently use the guru, but unfortunately this one doesn't say much about the plane itself :-/ \n\nBut you're right about not having many options. Most the itineraries are either the same day to day, or massively more expensive to catch the next set of connections for some reason.  I'm always shocked when I see the low prices pop up on Kayak, and then I realize that it's just Turkish airlines. There's no way I'm going to do 35 hours of travel for what should only be 14-16, even if it's a nicer airline (I've heard mixed things about them)  What do you like about KLM?"", '[deleted]', ""Ah i can see your confusion!

The food was... well, Dutch, but the legroom was the best I've experienced in economy class.  I don't know what the seating arrangement is called, but I once had a Lufthansa red eye (ORD-FRK)where the seats were so tight that you were forced to recline if the person in front of you did. It was a miserable flight. That said, I've never had an exceptional transatlantic flight experience on either of the two domestic carriers that I've taken, US Airways and United. "", ""> what dont you like about LH J? seating?\n\nThe seating is uncomfortable, the IFE is miserly, and the food is disgusting - it's a bit of a caricature but I am rarely surprised when I anticipate a few bits of actual food slathered in giant dollops of mayonnaise.\n\nI just did a round trip FRA-NRT-FRA and was completely unable to sleep in either direction because the seat was so uncomfortable, the worst I've had in years (normally I use Asian carriers).

I know they're very close and it's possible to both but they're some factors involved. We've never been to either so all of my knowledge is based on the information I've gathered on the web, word of mouth, etc. Here's what I got:

**Dates:** Either October 3rd-8th or 10th-14th

\- Traveling from Atlanta. No problem with traveling on different airlines or with layovers, just don't want to spend a day in the air (unless necessary, see below).

\- Prefer to stay in AirBnB but not opposed to a nice hotel at all.

\- Want to do a few activities if possible and eat some good food.

**Seattle Pros**

* Easy walkability (depending on where we stay)
* Good seafood
* Water Lantern Festival (weekend of the 13th)
* Surprise concert (Wednesday the 10th)
* Possible wolf encounter activity about 80 miles north of Seattle
* Mt. Rainer hike
* Possible soccer or football (American) game
* Legal weed

**Seattle Cons**

* Higher plane tickets
* Higher AirBnBs
* Higher food (?)
* May have to travel a bit for outdoor activities

**Vancouver Pros**

* Looks a little cleaner
* Looks a little more outdoorsy
* Cheaper plane ticket
* Cheaper AirBnBs
* Possible 11 hr layover in LA (her parents live there who I've never met so this could be a soft introduction)

**Vancouver Cons**

* Besides hiking or walking through Stanley Park, doesn't seem like there's much to do (looking for corrections here)
* No surprise concert

Last summer we volunteered to skip a scheduled flight, which was overbooked, to take a later flight and in return were gifted $500 each in flight vouchers for United Airlines.

The vouchers must be used by August this year, and we will be flying out of LAX. We basically have all of **July** free and would be happy to spend the full month away - and it doesn't have to be limited to USA, just the $1000 for two tickets.

**We don't have any budget for traveling** this summer, but really want to use up our vouchers. We enjoy camping and hiking and have a lot of equipment already, so that is one possible option.

39,Emirates customer service vs. others.,0,4ah80j,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4ah80j/emirates_customer_service_vs_others/,28,1458050308.0,"I recently made a post here about how I need to take my fur friends overseas. One of the top carriers on my list was Emirates. I have friends and family who work for the airline, I loved my experience with the airline - hell, I was willing to give up all of my loyalty to my previous carrier to fly with them. But a few things happened. I'd like to explain and I want to know if you have any horror stories, about them preferably or about others.  
  
First, I contacted the airline's BKK branch about some info for my animals. Their airport office, their downtown office - the phones, they just went off the hook for almost a week. I finally called Dubai and after they said I had to speak with BKK, oddly enough I finally got someone.  
  
Second, I've flown with multiple carriers whom allow pets as service animals or hell, even comfort animals. Why is it that a multinational carrier of such standard as Emirates can't handle such a thing? I'm an epileptic, I've taken my cats as service cats with me on American and others - no problem. Open armed welcome. Emirates even has a rejection policy for dogs ... if they can't take your service pet, they'll crate it as baggage / cargo for free. Well, you can bet your bum they wouldn't do the same for my rejected animals. I don't know, I don't mean to moan, but really - what age is this?!  
  
Next, on my most recent flight with them in October I had both great and poor service on two flights, respectively. I wanted to mention that to them. Every time I tried to get a manager, I was redirected or told in some rude fashion that I could not put in comments or whatever. This was in the DXB airport. I was stunned at the terrible customer service.  
  
Lastly, I've made several attempts to contact them ... Twitter, Facebook, etc ... especially since I see people going left and right about their lacking service. I crafted a short and polite complaint about the pet policy in hopes I'd hear from them ... but because it wasn't on a public forum, but just posted to their page - they went ahead and deleted it! That just shocked me. They are replying to everyone else, ""Private message us your flight info, complaint, XYZ"" ... of course, they don't want horror stories discussed in public, I get it. BUT! To have the nerve to delete complaints, concerns, or comments?! Jeez, that's next level.  
  
Again, I loved most of my experience with them. They are only second best to Norwegian in my recent flying years (Norwegian is an airline great for price, comfort, routes, fleet, etc - especially being relatively low-budget long haul) ... but while I mentioned, I was considering sacrificing my loyalty before, I've reconsidered and have said ""screw that!"". I don't want to be loyal to, let alone fly with ANY airline that behaves in this fashion. Not because I'm entitled to anything at all - but the customer is a priority. Me asking questions about my animal is strictly for the sake of others needing their animals for their disability. By disregarding me, they disregard those people. *sigh* Just absurd.  
  
Anyways! What do you have to say to this or any past experience? Venting is fine with me ...  
  
**TL;DR :** Emirates restricted cats on their flights as service animals even though DXB doesn't have any policy against it - they are incredibly rude with their customer service, and ... sadly as a great airline I won't be flying with them anymore because of poor decisions on their part.","[""Haven't had many opportunities to contact Emirates Customer Service, I'm still a big fan bcoz they have excellent in-flight experience.\n\n- just took a quick look at Emirates policy for animals. It is a UAE Federal Govt regulation that states animals must be transported as cargo with the exception of Service Dog for blind people. Seems like you need to blame the govt and not the airline.\n\n- you know that some/most Muslims think of dogs as impure? I'm not sure of the whole story with regards to religion, and not sure if Muslims nowadays still dislike dogs. But you can't blame Emirates for rejecting dogs as it might make other passengers uncomfortable.\n\n- not sure of what to say about them deleting your complains on public forums. But I suggest asking them questions about pet policy in a constructive way and in a way that you are trying to understand their rationale. I know angry customer can't really avoid using angry-tone in complain. But try again and see if you can get any reply. Otherwise like what they said, give exact info on flight details etc so they can give a more personal reply to you explaining your situation and they can followup according to see why BKK office failed to get back to you etc. "", ""I understand that you are upset and frustrated but this post is probably the not the best written to get your complaints addressed.

I'm actually not transporting a dog. That's my point though. Service dogs are the industry standard, but they aren't the only type of service animal. I, instead, have two cats. One who's been registered as such for about 5 years and flown as such on multiple carriers. With that said, cats are revered in Islam faith ... for their cleanliness, purity, etc. I can understand why people would have something against dogs, and even then, domestic dogs? People clean dogs as much as they clean themselves. You know? Hahah! And hell - if you're going to make your airline open to people of many religions then having a carrier based rule which is based on religion doesn't really make sense, does it? That's like when us Americans told Rosa Parks to get to the back of the bus ... because she was black. Maybe a bit of a wild comparison, but you get where I'm coming from - no? Also, regarding your suggestion - I started as 100% constructive and very kind. I mentioned my concern, I said that I hope to hear from them in a reply, etc. Super kind tone. But! I go back to check the post and it was simply deleted!!! I was just baffled. Not sure who practices business that way. I definitely get snide when I'm angry with businesses, but I also try to see from the other side, it's not X person's fault. I understand. However! The largest part of my post is that they had the nerve to delete the post. I was just ... stumped. That's just insane. As for the rest, well, you know - that's a matter of their policy and I'm but one customer. Not much money, but they'll be losing me."", ""I'm 100% with you. However the regulation with the government is that cats and dogs both are to be classified as service animals. Emirates just chooses to reject cats.  \n  \nWith that said, I have chosen to NOT take them on my journey home - no matter what. Aside from that, I've expressed my concerns and as mentioned - it seems they have taken serious effort to avoiding my complaints."", '[removed]', ""Well, one of my main two carriers, both of which I don't necessarily like, but have accrued a lot of miles with so I was loyal, are American Airlines and United. Both are enormous airlines, part of the two biggest mileage programs, and if I'm not mistaken AA is one of the biggest airlines in the world as far as destinations / routes go. They may not be luxurious - but I'm on a budget 95% of the time anyway, so it works for me ... But most important is that both companies are willing (and their partners) are willing to accommodate my service animal needs in some way or another. I haven't figured everything out - but last time, flying from Shanghai I took AA. I had no issues.  \n  \nI'd love to keep flying Emirates, but I can't justify it as they don't seem to care about my pets as much as they do about my money.  \n  \nOh, and I forgot to add - Emirates is great, I always wanted to get a chance to travel with them, but there's also Qatar, Ethiad, Singapore, and so many others who are of equal level in luxury if we must compare."", 'I very much appreciate your honest feedback and product suggestion. However! I have three kennels. Sadly, one of my cats died while living here. All three were shipped via cargo (not as checked baggage) during my way here from the States and during that experience I made it my mission to do whatever I could to not put them there again especially as I had one of my cats on my American flight in the cabin from Shanghai with no problem at all.', 'I can 100% understand your reasoning. However, I\'m sure someone might say the same for dogs, as both have hair and that\'s your allergy if I\'m not mistaken. Also - while one of my cats doesn\'t have a certification, it has always traveled as a service cat as he is very perceptive to my epilepsy. I\'m not sure any airline would say ""we have an allergic person on board"" ... and if so, I\'m sure they would accommodate both parties equally.  \n  \nAlso, I should say, it\'s not as easy to travel with an animal on a flight with a layover as you think. For instance, for Cathay transiting in HKG I need documents for HKG even though I\'m not stepping through customs or exiting into HKG. For Emirates, they can only be in the checked baggage for a total of 17hrs including transit time, any more is cargo. I\'ve paid cargo once - it cost me $1,3k USD. I don\'t have that money to spend or 1.) I wouldn\'t be posting in a sub that\'s mostly filled with budget travelers 2.) I am not sure I would complain about the service of an airline and 3.) I think I would, as you said, just do cargo.', 'Sorry about the formatting. Just want to bring out the point that the airline has nothing to do with failure to provide better service by letting your service cats in. \n\n""In accordance with United Arab Emirates Federal Government regulations, all animals must enter the UAE as manifested cargo. An exception is made for guide dogs for the blind (seeing-eye dogs), which may travel free of charge in the aircraft cabin on direct Emirates flights from European Union member states, or to or from the USA and Canada.""\n\n\nAlso, I was just guessing about Muslim disliking dogs might be the reason for rejecting dogs. Even if they want to provide best service to international passengers (esp Americans who think the same way as you do), Emirates is based in UAE and it is likely that they have a lot of Muslim customers. Sure they can provide pork just bcoz the whole world like it, but it is not likely for them to do so. What would people in UAE think if Emirates serve ""pork or fish?"" and they are forced to take fish bcoz Muslims won\'t take them? They probably want the airline of their own country to cater to their needs. It is a completely different situation as compared to your example of American racism to Black. You quoted a bad example.', ""It looks like [Qatar airlines](http://support.qatarairways.com/hc/en-us/articles/206465988-Can-my-pet-travel-in-the-cabin-with-me-) also does not allow [service cats](http://support.qatarairways.com/hc/en-us/articles/206465978-Can-my-service-dog-travel-in-the-cabin-with-me-) either, so it's not just Emirates.

The example was horrible and the policy regarding pets is clearly stated.  If OP doesn't like the clearly stated policies, OP can choose another carrier that has policies that work for her situation.\n\nReligion or food service though seems to have little to do with this conversation though.  I think it's probably best just to point out it has to do with governmental regulations. Unless one wants to get into the justification for the laws.  The law is what it is."", 'Not a problem!  \n  \nAgain, I\'m with you. But! This is a made up rule. This is a policy of the company and not UAE. You found it on their site, but UAE is fine with me entering with a different service animal. They allow cats as service animals. Emirates doesn\'t. That\'s my frustration with the airline.  \n  \nAs for Emirates, you know, I understand your comment and I respect it to a certain degree. However I feel like international airlines have to abide by international policies. I don\'t even want to think of what Chinese airlines would be like if they said they will play by Chinese standards / logic (and believe me, Chinese airlines aren\'t bad at all - maybe you know).  \n  \nAlso, ""What would people in UAE think if Emirates serve ""pork or fish?"" and they are forced to take fish bcoz Muslims won\'t take them?"" ... this EXACT scenario happened on my last flight haha. I\'m not sure of the two meals, but it seemed that one was more skewed towards those of Muslim faith and the other two were either Western or generic (vegetarian) and well, by the time food came down ... people had literally been arguing for the priority food.  \n  \nI feel like if they want to survive a satisfied Western customer base they\'ll need to do more than have a non-unionized (always trading) staff, nice fleet, etc. to boost their ratings - they\'ll need to adapt to the ways of the world.  \n  \nAlso, my quote, yes may have been a bit extreme. But consider this ... what we discussed earlier is that the carrier mainly works for those of Muslim faith, so they have to respect them - which was said in a way that they put less of a priority on their Western or Eastern passengers (even though they are a worldwide airline). To me, this is like forcing your ways on someone, like segregation. But my example was very extreme and I apologize. If I could make a better example, I would. I know you understand what I\'m trying to say though!', 'I\'ll have to call directly. Most airlines that allow ""emotional support"" animals are a bit more flexible. Thanks for bringing Qatar up though! Also, I see that if you fly them exclusively then you can take animals as checked baggage and not cargo. That\'s great. You have probably helped the most today so far just by pointing me to the site! Haha.', ""Just spoke to Qatar. They allow cats as excess baggage (instead of having to do cargo), I didn't talk much about cabin ... and that is an awesome thing to hear considering the ticket price is competitive with Emirates anyways. Thanks again for the inspiration!"", 'Check it. I also spoke to AA about Royal Jordanian, Cathay and others on OneWorld ... they went over how most of them have the same policy for ""emotional support"" animals and service animals (cats or dogs or whatever). I guess I\'ll just have to keep my loyalty with Oneworld. Not only that, but damn, every time I speak with a rep - they always give great service and I know they aren\'t known for that.', 'Oops I tend to go off topic just to argue my points about the need to respect other countries/religions', 'I disagree with what you said ""forcing your ways on someone"". I think you failed to understand the difference between doing the minimum to satisfy both Muslim and Western/International customers, and catering for international customers. The airline simply follows the stricter rule in order to be compliant to both sides. Using food as example, there\'s food such as pork that Muslim cannot eat, but I don\'t think that there\'s food that is skewed towards Muslim and prevents international customers from enjoying them. So win-win for both. Not just for Airlines, but for other industries too. If a bank from a Muslim country opens a branch in land of freedom America the bank probably has to follow both Islamic banking rules and American banking regulations. Of course to American customers it doesn\'t make sense, but you can always go for other banks.\n\n\nOK this is going way off topic. Just trying to bring out the point against the examples you\'ve given.', ""I'm all for respecting others beliefs but there's always a time and place to discuss these topics. Sticking to the facts and topics at hand helps guide the discourse.  Getting started on subjects such as countries/religions can quickly derail the conversation and decrease participation/other valuable input.\n\nIt didn't seem to me the OP had any issue with the religion or the countries, so seemed out of place to make such a leap."", ""I understand the point you're trying to make / are making. I may be a bit upset at the moment. I still definitely feel like having a product aimed at an international audience with certain standards is very limiting, however! I understand it. I live overseas in a country that behaves in this manner - I just don't agree with it in a business sense. But, hey, as someone else said - I can make my voice best heard with my wallet - though I also wanted to make this known to this community because I'm not JUST having problems with the pet situation, I'm also being avoided, been treated rudely by ground staff, etc. If you visit their FB, you'll see this is a daily concern as they spend a majority of their comments replying to criticism rather than complements. There must be a reason. So I figured I would voice my concern in case anyone was considering this airline."", ""I brought in this just bcoz OP mentioned rejection policy for dogs and I provided input on what I know about Emirates --> UAE --> Muslim --> dogs.\n\nI agree it's going off in wrong direction. But not completely out of place.\n\nAlright I will stop here."", ""I understand your frustration of them deleting your comments etc. Maybe if they still don't give you any feedback, try website like Trustpilot where Emirates is not allowed to delete comments like what they do in Facebook?

40,NYC to Thailand,8,gg393,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/gg393/nyc_to_thailand/,28,1301660158.0,"My boyfriend and I really want to go to Thailand in July (we know it will be hot!).  He has enough American Airline miles to get one round trip ticket.  

Here are my questions: 
- How can we get there for as cheap as possible?  I have tried KAYAK, bing, cheaptickets... Anyone know any tricks?
- Is it worth the savings to travel separately?  

UPDATE:  My boyfriend's AMAZING mother donated her American Airlines miles to us so we booked yesterday!!  We each only had to pay $104!  Way to go miles!  Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has helped out so far!

We are now looking to plan the trip, itself.  So far, our wish lists includes a night out on the town (perhaps to drink with a ladyboy or two?), an underground Thai kickboxing match, temples, beach and food.  I am ready and open for all tips, suggestions and recommendations. 

Thanks, again to all who are nice enough to take a minute or two to help a stress out wannabe traveler!! 

HELP!!??!?!?!  
Thanks!","['Try [Matrix](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/), select ""see calendar of lowest fares"", and then enter a range for the duration (e.g. 15-20 days). Best r/t fare in July NYC-BKK is ~$1410 (on China Eastern via Shanghai). If your dates are not flexible, expect to pay ~$1800.\n\nThis gives you an overview of when tickets are cheapest, without hunt-and-peck approach of other sites. It is worth to travel separately, cheapest fare saves you a lot compared to AA. However, matching up the *dates* for a free award ticket and cheapest fare will be tricky.', 'It will also be wet.', ""my wife and I flew separately, no big deal. you might try flights from s.f.

So if you can use your miles to get two tickets from NYC to London, you'd only have to spend ~$600 r/t p/p on that leg of the flight. \n\nAirAsia is no frills, but I learned my lesson the hard way after travelling to SE Asia via Japan and eating up a one-way from Tokyo to Bangkok aboard United . All the travelling I did around SE Asia was via AirAsia too. Easy to book, very nice staff, they have buses and hotels as well and fly most destinations. I flew nine times with them in three months and never had a hassle, even upgraded to the premium class on my way to London (+$300) just for shits. It's no frills, so bring something to read, but it's a great way to travel."", ""When (exactly) and where in thailand are you going?  You have two major airports, phuket (hkt) and Bangkok (bkk).  Technically there are two in Bangkok,  but lets assume only one because it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe flight prices swing around fairly rapidly, but the best you will find, outside of a special sale, is about 1200-1300 dollars.  Since you have AA miles, you may be able to fly on some other airline with those miles.  \n\nAs a oneworld partner I suggest contacting AA and asking if you can use your miles to fly on Cathay Pacific from jfk to bkk, returning the same way.   You can also purchase a ticket at the same time, the cost seems to be 1324 dollars for mid may as of about 5 minutes ago for a ticket in may, but july is 1824.  The reason I bring this up is to show the fluctuation, though in my opinion I would wait for the 1824 price to come down, since july is more into the low season, business will probably be slower.  Then again, can you change your plans and go in may?  If so, do it.  \n\nBe aware there are a number of options of exactly which routes to take, but only one with CP ends up with 21hours out and 19-20 hours back.  On long flights in coach, spend the extra 50 bucks to get out of the airport 6 hours earlier!  Believe me, you will be chomping at the bit after the first 10 hours, having to endure ANOTHER 20 hours is maddening.\n\nBecause you want an award ticket, be aware that you might have to be flexible on exactly when you leave/return, but your highest chances are mid week.  Prices are also generally lower tue/wed to tue/wed.  This is where it is worth the extra 20-30 bucks to call a reservationist at AA and have them help you with the ticket.\n\nIf you are going to phuket, sometimes it is easiest to just go to bkk and get a jump down on bangkok air or some other airline.  about $100 per person.  Then again, may on CP is about 1280 to hkt one stop.\n\nHere is an example, this is to bkk and $1324.\nThis flight leaves on Sunday and arrives on Monday. \n\tCathay Pacific  \nFlight 841 \t Departs: 10:05a \nJohn F Kennedy Intl (JFK)\t \t Arrives: 2:05p \nHong Kong Intl (HKG)\n \t Boeing 777-300 (Wide-body Jet)  | 16h 00m  | 8057 miles\n \tBusiness  | Fare code: CR  | 4 seats remain \nEconomy  | Fare code: LLWSPCL  | 4 seats remain \n \t  Layover in Hong Kong, HK, China (HKG) for 1h 45m \n\tCathay Pacific  \nFlight 701 \t Departs: 3:50p \nHong Kong Intl (HKG)\t \t Arrives: 5:30p \nBangkok (BKK)\n \t Airbus A330 (Wide-body Jet)  | 2h 40m  | 1048 miles\n \tBusiness  | Fare code: CR  | 4 seats remain \nEconomy  | Fare code: LLWSPCL  | 4 seats remain \n\n Return – Sun May 22 2011\n\tCathay Pacific  \nFlight 708 \t Departs: 10:25a \nBangkok (BKK)\t \t Arrives: 2:15p \nHong Kong Intl (HKG)\n \t Airbus A330 (Wide-body Jet)  | 2h 50m  | 1048 miles\n \tBusiness  | Fare code: DWNYCSER  | 4 seats remain \nEconomy  | Fare code: LLWSPCL  | 4 seats remain \n \t  Layover in Hong Kong, HK, China (HKG) for 1h 55m \n\tCathay Pacific  \nFlight 840 \t Departs: 4:10p \nHong Kong Intl (HKG)\t \t Arrives: 8:05p \nJohn F Kennedy Intl (JFK)\n \t Boeing 777-300 (Wide-body Jet)  | 15h 55m  | 8057 miles\n \tBusiness  | Fare code: DWNYCSER  | 4 seats remain \nEconomy  | Fare code: LLWSPCL  | 4 seats remain \n  \nBTW: Have you been there before, do you understand the basic cultural differences?

Breakdown of expenses for 2 people:


* **Plane Tickets: $480**
We flew coach with American Airlines as it was the cheapest option. On the way there we did not have seats together but on the way back home we did. Not a big deal but be prepared to pay more if you select American and want seats together as their seating system is kind of wacky. The flights were direct flights. 

* **Lodging: $1,040**
We stayed at the Embassy Suites by Hilton Washinton DC Convention Center. It was a central location near almost everything so that we could walk to most places. This particular deal had free breakfast in the morning and free drinks and snacks between 5:30PM and 7:30PM. The hotel was very nice and the bed was comfortable. Our room was quite large so it didn’t feel like we were coming into just a room and more like coming into an apartment. The room had a kitchenette but it didn’t have a hot plate; only a sink and a mini fridge.


* **Transportation: $243.56**
 This one is a bit tricky because I debated renting a car, however, renting a car alone would have been much, much more expensive and I would have had the stress of having to worry about the car I rented, paying for parking, and paying for the gas for it. Renting a car alone, the most cost effective one I could find was $49 dollars a day and at 5 days that was already $245, then add the cost of parking, gas, insurance, etc. it would have been way more so we decided to use Lyft everywhere. It can be reduced drastically if your travelling partner is willing to walk or bike ride; mine wasn’t. I could have saved $60~ if my SO was willing to walk a bit more. I’d like to mention that the cost of transportation includes a $16.75 all-day Metro Card I used to go from McPherson Square Station in DC to Reston, VA, a Lyft ride from the Reston station to the Udvar-Hazy Museum (The other part of the Air and Space museum located in Chantilly, VA) and then the same rides back so that was a little expensive. That particular trip individually for those interested is broken down below: 


* Sub-trip to Chantilly, VA for Udvar-Hazy Museum: $54.05
* City Bike to McPherson Sq. Station - Free
* Metro to Whiele-Reston East - $16.75 - I bought an all-day pass because I didn’t have time to cost out how much it would be, if you take time to cost this out it’s probably a bit less.
* Lyft to Udvar-Hazy from Whiele-Reston East - 17.91
* Lyft from Udvar-Hazy to Whiele-Reston East - 19.39

For the info above you can probably save money by doing Lyft line but you’d have to wait longer and I’m not very patient and I only had 5 days there to see a lot of things. 

* **[Food](http://imgur.com/NIuJ7lf): $543.15**
This was our second most expensive spending category even beyond transportation. This is primarily due to the fact that I love food and I wanted to try everything and anything. In the album you will find a breakdown of the food expenses. Below are my short and sweet reviews of the restaurants I visited:

* Ben’s Chili Bowl: Excellent chili. Not worth the hype and the 40 minutes I waited in line to get it. Can easily be recreated at home. It’s more about the experience and the history that it has. Crowded & unsanitary to be be in there waiting to order and get your food. 3 out of 5. 

* Good Stuff Eatery: My favorite food stop we made while we were there. This place was created by Spike Mendelsohn, a Top Chef contestant. Delicious, humongous burgers packed with flavor and delicious fries along with a mini bar of different aiolis to dip them in. However, my favorite part was not the food but the milkshakes. I had a toasted marshmallow milkshake there and I’ve never tasted anything like it. I had two when i first went and I had 2 more towards the end of my trip. That’s the 13 dollar amount you see in the cost breakdown. 5 out of 5. 

* Hill Country BBQ Market: Great BBQ, huge portions. This restaurant is a little crowded and the service is strange. The servers only take care of your drinks and your empty plates and your desserts, everything else you have to go get at a Chipotle style serving location. 5 out of 5. 

* Momofuku CCDC: This restaurant was created by Chef David Chang, from the show Mind of a Chef. The restaurant is like any other restaurant except the food is a bit elevated as far as flavors go. There are different flavors and ideas I had never seen before. I went twice, once with my SO and once without. It was good enough that I went back, but I wouldn’t go a third time by my own will. It’s not a craveable place like Good Stuff Eatery’s milkshake is to me. Service was different that I’m accustomed to where you have a server and he/she stays with you throughout. Apparently, the servers serve everyone at all times regardless. It took over 15 minutes for me to get the glass of wine I ordered, but that was the only downside I experienced. There’s a shop attached to this restaurant called Milk, founded by the same restaurant group and I have to say it’s extremely overrated. Our desserts came from this place and my “crack pie” was dry and flavorless, as if it had been sitting in a fridge for a while and my SO’s grapefruit pie wasn’t anything to brag about. Overall still 4 out of 5. 

* Matchbox Pizza: Located near Chinatown this place was great. They had a lot of different variety of foods but I honestly just went straight for the pizza. I got half and half of a small pie, it was half spicy italian sausage, pepperoni and bacon with tomato sauce and half arugula, black pepper honey, gorgonzola, black mission figs, garlic and prosciutto. The fig half was the better half although the other half was the one that was recommended to me by our server. Nonetheless, great, affordable pizza spot if you’re just craving pizza. 5 out of 5.

There were other places we were interested in, but because of time restraints and not having appropriate clothing we did not go. Still we have places to see there so, in the future we will pack accordingly. 

* **Spending Money: $150~** 
We didn’t really spend any money as all the museums and attractions are free but we still bought souvenirs and clothing with DC branding on it. 


**Museums, Memorials & Attractions:**
I’m not going to spend a lot of time talking about this unless people are really interested since my review of all of these will be subjective but I will give out a 1 out of 5 rating for all of the things I saw with 1 being skip it and 5 being must see/visit, along with a brief opinion of why I think yay or nay. Keep in mind all of these attractions and museums are free!!! 

**Memorials/Attractions:**

Lincoln Memorial: 5 - Amazing. Humbling.
 
Reflecting Pool: 5 - You can’t miss it because it’s huge and in the middle of everything. 

Washington Monument: 4 - You can see it from everywhere. Pretty cool. 

Vietnam War Memorial: 5 - Heartbreaking. Beautiful. 

Korean War Memorial: 4 - Beautiful. Go at night if you can. 

WW2 Memorial: 4 - Pretty cool. 

US Capitol: 3 - It’s there. You can see it from the Washington Monument and everywhere really. 

The White House: 4 - Very beautiful structure.

Iwo Jima Statue: 5 - Incredible, huge statue!

Arlington Cemetery 5 - Great. Very straight tombstones. 

Pentagon: 2 - It’s whatever. Crazy shaped building. 

SCOTUS: 3 - Cool building.

Library of Congress: 5 - Get a reader card. Ask how to get one, since it’s hard to find,  so you can go into the main reading room. Absolutely worth it although you can’t take pictures in there. All you need is your ID and some time. 

Shakespeare Library: 1 - A couple of paintings/books/artifacts and that’s it. Save your time.


**Museums:**

Air and Space: 5 - My favorite museum. Absolutely must see.

Air and Space in Chantilly: 5 - Must, must, must see! Absolutely incredible. It’s about 2 hours away in public transportation. 

Natural History: 5 - Hope diamond, other cool Earth stuff.

American History: 4 - Cool stuff. 

African American History: 4 - Cool stuff. 

Holocaust Museum: 2 - As a WW2 buff, this place was underwhelming. A lot of castings and recreations of real artifacts as opposed to real items. Not my cup of tea.

Smithsonian Castle: 4 - Very cool building and Smithson’s Crypt is inside! Full walk around takes like 30 minutes.

Smithsonian National Zoo: 5 - I love animals and this was an awesome experience!

42,Would you pay quite a bit more to fly with your main frequent flier airline?

She travels a lot for work and I try to get her to use one world whenever possible, but sometimes she will pick Southwest or Delta just because it is more convenient. That's fine. It's her life. But right now we are looking at summer vacation tickets to Europe. The one world Alliance tickets are extremely expensive at the moment. Perhaps they will drop, especially since the euro is doing poorly against the dollar, and of course the airlines are raking in record profits, but on the other hand they may not drop the prices if they can sell them for these exorbitant prices.


There are some other airlines which are a few hundred dollars cheaper to our destination, such as Icelandair and the Portuguese airline TAP. But they have some drawbacks in terms of the itinerary , and also we would be losing quite a few miles. Now the important thing about having miles for me is keeping my status, because I like having the free main cabin extra seats , as well as boarding first and all that other crap. I rarely used my miles for award tickets, although we have and it has saved us a lot of money. 

So I'm wondering whether should pay perhaps 200 or $300 more per ticket to fly with one world then with one of these non Alliance Airlines, like Delta or Swissair. Is it really worth a few hundred dollars to get those extra mile points? I'm not one of those people who are good at valuing miles per dollar and all that, so any advice you could give me would be appreciated!","[""I am in the same boat since I am near the United hub at IAD. I try and take United when possible but have flown Jet Blue and Southwest when cheaper. If it's $300 per ticket, I would take the cheaper airline if the itinerary is workable.

I will fly non-Alliance airlines if there's a big price difference but not slight itinerary issues as long as it isn't unreasonable. Luckily enough, for me that usually works out being the cheapest option or only negligably more expensive (like 10€). \n\nMiles really aren't the problem, most of the time you'll get your miles from anything *but* flying but the FF perks do the trick for me. Extra bag, expedited security and check-in, better choice of seats and/or upgrades, etc. If that means I pay 10-20% more for all of that, then I'm in.

You can baseline your mile valuation at $0.02/mile and crunch the numbers to see if it\'s worth it.  Also, if you\'re flying in coach, keep in mind that you\'ll get lounge access if you fly OneWorld, which could be worth a moderate amount if you have a long layover.  Furthermore, if these miles are necessary to put you over a status goal, then it\'s easily worth it IMO.', ""I'm sure someone can do the math, but for a one-off flight, there is no chance that choosing  flight that is more expensive by this amount solely based on frequent flier would be worth it."", 'I used to, but miles have become so worthless in the last few years, that all my loyalty is gone.

44,"24F American planning a two week Europe trip, looking for feedback on my itinerary",2,6bql2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6bql2p/24f_american_planning_a_two_week_europe_trip/,26,1495074712.0,"Hello Travelers! I am planning a 2-week trip to Europe in early November. I’m American and this will be my first time in Europe (though I’ve traveled extensively in other continents). I’d love some critiques and recommendations on my draft itinerary. I will be meeting my brother who is studying abroad in London for part of his fall break. Destinations were chosen based on being iconic travel destinations, recommendations from friends, and proximity to one another. 

* Days 1-4: London (with brother)
* Days 5-7: Paris (with brother)
* Days 8-9: Amsterdam (with brother)
* Days 10-12: Copenhagen (solo)
* Days 13-16: Berlin/Frankfurt/Other? (solo)

A few things to consider:

* **Germany:** I’ve heard amazing things about Berlin and everyone I’ve asked has said it’s THE place to go in Germany. However, for some reason flights to NYC from Frankfurt are a lot cheaper and faster than from Berlin. I’m considering cutting my time in Berlin short to go to Frankfurt for a couple days and fly out from there, or maybe cutting out Berlin altogether. Or even choosing an entirely different final destination. I’d appreciate any input on this. 
* **Safety:** I’m 24F, not concerned about safety with my brother but for the solo legs I want to make sure wherever I go is safe for a woman traveling alone. From what I’ve heard this shouldn’t be an issue in major European cities. I won’t have working cell service but I’ll be able to use my phone over Wi-Fi. I can string together a few basic sentences in French, Spanish, and German.
* **Airfare:** I have 130k Delta miles and Platinum status. I’m hoping this will be enough to cover my flight to/from (based in NYC) and most of the travel between cities. I’m pretty sure I can use my status to get a free checked bag on partner airlines (main ones will be Air France and KLM). I also have AMEX points which can be transferred to British Airways. If needed I don’t mind paying out of pocket for a flight (or train if it makes sense) as long as it’s affordable and I can avoid excessive fees. Will probably use a bag sized 22x14x9 (inches) which I know may not fit European carry-on requirements. Will probably make a new post in /r/awardtravel but feel free to comment if you have any perspective on using Skymiles in Europe. 
* **Lodging:** I have 170k Marriott points and 50k SPG points. Planning to use these up on lodging. If a city doesn’t have a Marriot or SPG property or if I run out of points I’ll book AirBNB or a cheap hotel. Transferring AMEX points to Hilton rewards is also an option.
* **Budget:** Since the majority of my trip is subsidized with points I’m not very concerned about budget. I’d obviously like to avoid excessive expenses but I don’t mind splurging a bit to make the most of the trip. Would like to keep expenses below $2000 USD if possible. 
* **Interests:** With my brother we will be doing partying and drinking but also seeing the typical sights, museums, and enjoying the food. By myself I will do less crazy nightlife stuff and more walking around, taking in the sights, and maybe the occasional drink at a bar. TBH I’m pretty introverted but I’m open to making new friends to hang out with as long as I’m able to retreat back to my hotel if I want to do my own thing or if I’m getting a creepy vibe. 


I know I’m not spending a lot of time in each city. I’m really trying to cram as much into my 2 weeks as possible, but spending enough time in each city to not feel super rushed. I’m very flexible with my itinerary and willing to adjust based on recommendations, the only things set in stone are the first 4 days in London (need to meet up with my brother and visiting universities) and spending at least a day in Copenhagen (planning to meet up with an old friend). Thank you in advance for any critiques or recommendations!

It's not entirely clear when you'll be travelling between cities, but the worst-case scenario is you having one full day in Paris, which isn't really optimal, and the Amsterdam leg could also be really short.

45,I've bought tickets for international flights with layovers of 1 hour.

Three of my flights (one from Austin to Tokyo, another from Amsterdam to Helsinki, and the third from Helsinki to Austin) have a connecting flight in a foreign country that I have to make in roughly 1 hour.

The flight from Austin stops in Dallas (which I'm not concerned about) and then lands in Vancouver via American Airlines where I then have an hour and 3 minutes to make it to a Japanese Airlines flight leaving for Tokyo.

For the flight from Amsterdam to Helsinki, I'm flying Air Baltic the whole way and have a layover of 1 hour in Latvia.

For the flight from Helsinki to Austin, I have one connection between icelanair planes in Reykjavik that I have to make in 1 hour. 

My concerns were only raised after making a seat reservation with JAL over the phone, and the dude I was talking to advised me that it may be a challenge to make it through international customs and to the next plane in that amount of time.

46,American Airlines and EB Hotel in Miami have lied to us and won't refund our money. Be aware of this if ever happens to you.,61,3dy5le,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3dy5le/american_airlines_and_eb_hotel_in_miami_have_lied/,27,1437430930.0,"After a month writing up and down to both the airline AA and EB Hotel in Miami, I am recurring to the social audience.

Here is our little story.

We are from Uruguay, South America. We (three guys) have traveled to Japan in June (terrific place, totally recommended and the 30 hour plane flights from home were totally worth it)

On our way back from Japan to Uruguay, we had to change planes twice. Once in Chicago and the other in Miami. We booked everything with American Airlines.

When we arrive to Chicago airport, we look at the screen, and we notice that our flight to Miami is delayed a couple of hours, and that would make us lose our connection to Uruguay.

We are very calm and reasonable people, so we go to an American Airlines desk in our gate, and ask what shall we do. In a rude way they tell us that our flight is delayed and that the desk is open for another flight, that we should call on one of the information phones.

That's what we do, we call with our hopes that they could delay some minutes our flight from Miami Montevideo, as we would only need some minutes to change planes, and as delays happen all the time, maybe it was worth it.

After several minutes on the phone, they tell us that they are sorry, but there is nothing they can do, so they offer to reschedule the flight for the next day and that we will be spending the night at a hotel in Miami. As already told you, we are calm and reasonable people, we know there are not many flights back to Uruguay, and if they couldn't hold the plane some minutes, there was nothing we can do. So everything is arranged on the phone and we start calling back to our place, as we will arrive 24 hours later.

When we take the plane to Miami, I have no idea how they did it, but they were flying up there! I mean really flying! Because it took like half an hour less than scheduled. And the American Airlines crew were very aware of people getting connections and informed us that they were doing everything they could to take everybody on time. They start saying a lot of connections, but skip ours, probablly because we already handled it on the phone, but then again, this was a really fast flight.

When we get off the plane, and we ask to the guy there if there is a chance we could get our connection, says to us that it has just took off, that we should go to a gate and get our vouchers printed to stay the night and get food for the next day. Our flight took off around 2359, and we arrived like 0005.

We didn't have many hopes to catch it, but as it was so fast, there was a chance. If we didn't made that call, maybe the plane could have been delayed a little bit. We don't know, but still not the point of this.

We put in line and patiently wait for our time. Here is our main mistake, and that I want to warn you all about. When we start talking with the American Airlines personal there, he ask us how many rooms do we want. We were good people, and we did the trip allways staying in a triple room, so we go ahead and say one room for the three of us would be fine (voucher said one room three people). Then they give us voucher for breakfast, lunch and dinner to take at the hotel or the airport.

Our bags had to stay at the airport, so we only had what we took to the plane, which obviously wasn't much as we were heading home.

We wait for the van that would take us to the hotel, and we arrive at the hotel like 1am, very hungry as the flight Chicago Miami didn't have any food, and we didn't have time to eat anything. 

The guy at the EB Hotel, asks for our voucher, we register, all normal. Provides us the key, and we go up to our room. When we open the door, and start looking around, we only see two beds. Oh shit, the guy screwed up... Lets go down!

He see us coming and asks if everything is ok, and we tell him it only has two beds. Asks us to wait as there were people in front of us now, and when it is our time, we explain what is going on and that we need three beds. He then tell us that the EB hotel doesn't have three beds rooms, we ask for another room then as it was for three people, he says they can't, etc. We ask him to phone American Airlines and get this worked out, he dials it up for us and gives us the phone.

We talk and American Airlines people explain us that the gate desk for the vouchers should be closed by now (it was like 2 am) and that our best soultion was to pay for the room and deal with this at the next day at the airport, that we were right and there wouldn't be an issue.

This is our second mistake probablly, we just inform the desk guy about this, now with monday newspaper I think it would have been better to let them speak between each other. The desk guy seemed really nice and says he will give us the American Airlines price, as he was sure they will return our money back. He was lying. He didn't give us the American Airlines price. An extra room costed around 200 USD, for like 9 hours as check out was at 11 am.

We go ahead, have a short sleep and a bath as there wasn't much time for anything.

At breakfast at the EB Hotel, we get aware that the voucher provided for breakfast was only enough for a couple of coffees. So the nice people there suggests us to use the lunch voucher with that too, so we could eat something, and as we had to make check out, the voucher wouldn't be good for the hotel, nor the airport, as we know how much they charge at the airports. So now we have one less food, but at least a good breakfast.

At the checkout, I made a small letter saying that because EB Hotel didn't have three beds room, we had to rent one. Something like a small proof to show to American and avoid troubles, but EB Hotel refused to sign it.

When we arrive to the airport, we speak with the desk, we speak with a couple of managers, and they tell us that they are surprised anything like that was told us on the phone, as the only way they could make a refund is if we complaint online, they can't handle it in person. But they did understood our position, and they were sure our money would be refunded.

We decide to not make a big deal, and to follow the burocracy procedures, and as soon as we get home, we make the complaint.

After three days from leaving Japan we arrive our beautiful home.

We then proceed to make the complaint to American Airlines. First response was after five minutes, saying they won't be responsible for such thing, and I quote:

> we cannot assume financial responsibility for our customers' personal time lost or for out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of operational difficulties. Instead, you have my assurance that we will always work hard to get you to your destination on time. AA Ref#1-3787300234

I personally go to the American Airlines office here in Montevideo - Uruguay, and they tell us that it is really strange and they should refund it, but sadly they can't handle it on person, that we should insist with the burocratic procedure.

The *beautiful* thing about American Airlines, is that you can't reply to their responses. You have to create a new ticket, with all the flight information, and you can't even reference to a prior ticket. It's horrible, it's nasty and it is probablly intended so people surrender to such things. But I don't surrender.

After a month sending multiple tickets, we got a partial refund. Took over 10 tickets. And it is only partial. We never made a big deal because we were arriving 24 hours later, they don't have to worry about the people who asked for a day off in order to catch us up from the airport, or how we should explain at work that we arrived a day after, etc. No, their answer after a month, was to give a partial refund, because that was the real contract price they have arranged with EB hotel.

They have asked us for invoice proof multiple times, and we delivered. Yet this is the last reply I got.

> We are sorry that our original responses and hotel reimbursement of $105.00 has fallen short of meeting your expectations. We reimburse for hotel accommodations up to the contracted rate if there is a flight delay or cancellation within our control and causes the passenger an overnight stay. While this reimbursement is not what you anticipated, it is the maximum reimbursement that will be issued. There will be no further communication from our office regarding this matter. AA Ref#1-3942974471

See how rude they are after a month trying to contact them. 100 USD won't change our lifes, if we split it it will be 33 each, and we managed to go to Japan. But it is obviously not about the money. We need to trust in our flight companys. And they aren't cheap as to get a horrible treat as this.

So, be aware if something like this ever happens to you. 

If they ask you how many rooms you want, ask as many as you can. Avoid yourself troubles.

If they suggest you to do something, make them talk between each other, do not trust in what they said all alone. It's a shame we didn't have a written proof about those calls.

TLDR: American Airlines gave us a hotel voucher that EB Hotel couldn't fullfill, and we had to pay for it and they refuse to refund it despite being their mistake","[""That sucks dude.

You should pay AA back the $100 they gave you."", ""Not that I can find, but I can personally vouch for it. (I'm sure you'll accept that, lol) I worked central baggage for American Airlines. You won't find a source on it because they don't really advertise it. For me, as an employee, just to tour the underground belt system took a lot of red tape to get through, and I worked corporate. DFW is gargantuan. It has it's own zip code. Does every bag travel that far, no, but they easily can. It takes 15-20 minutes just to get to the TSA matrix. If it gets flagged, you won't get your bag at your destination. \n\nDFW is one of the largest airports in the world, and that is judging by acreage. I assure you, they have a lot more than 17 miles of belts. Terminal D alone services 32,000 passengers a day, and they have 5 terminals. Also, they are adding a 6th. The reason for such a long journey is sorting them. It's done by scanners, and the barcode stickers they put on your bag. \n\nObviously I can't find any citations on this and you don't have to believe me, but I've seen the systems up close. They are mind blowing. When you're on the ground floor at a major airport, usually baggage, there is literally an entire set of levels below you that you don't even know exist. I know Sky Harbor (PHX) is around 6-7 miles. \n\nI will give you one travel tip though for checking bags. You know how you fill out that tag with your info and tie it to your handle? The belts love to eat those. Fill out two more, and put them INSIDE your bag. If tags get eaten and the bag goes to the wrong place, they'll easily find it on the inside and you'll get it back 99.9% of the time. ""]"

48,Iceland Trip Report (in only 5 days),30,86b8gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/86b8gq/iceland_trip_report_in_only_5_days/,26,1521751744.0,"My girlfriend and I took a very brief trip to Iceland back in October of 2016. I recently read a very useful trip report from another user on Italy and found it very useful and I’m hoping someone here can find this useful.


[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/hu4DB)


**Day 1: Reykjavik**

* **Flight**: We took advantage of the cheap airfare from Boston to Reykjavik (KEF) and got a roundtrip ticket that cost $300/person with **WOW airlines**. Be aware, WOW is like any other budget airline, every additional feature of the flight will cost you extra (checked baggage, seat selection, water, etc.). The flight was overnight and arrived into KEF @ 0430.
* **Car**: We rented a small SUV from **Blue Car Rental**. They were fine, had no issues with them. We would find out later that the SUV was not necessary and we could have gone with a sedan. Regardless, I found that renting a car in Iceland is a must. Navigating the country is easy and the freedom of driving the car in a country is the best way to explore.
* **Spa**: We had some time to kill before **Blue Lagoon** opened which we spent driving around the area, just exploring. Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa located just 20 minutes from the airport. It is a popular tourist destination and as such should be booked well in advance to your trip. We scheduled the “Comfort” package which is just the barebones entrance into the geothermal pool. I highly recommend you schedule your time right at 0800. Get there early and get changed quickly. You will have the pool to yourself for a little bit before the crowds get bad. We were in and out and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and didn’t deal with any crowds.
* **Helicopter**: After we drove into Reykjavik. We had a helicopter tour with **Nordurflug** scheduled. This tour was very expensive but still very cool regardless. The company was amazing and so was our pilot. He took us out on a loop, leaving Reykjavik, and landing on a nearby mountain where we got to enjoy the view, chat and drink some champagne before returning. I highly recommend this company if you have the money. I would definitely do them again but maybe a longer tour to a glacier or something.
* **Reykjavik**: The rest of the day was spent exploring Reykjavik and walking around **Laugavegur** (the main road with lots of shops) and eating at **Baejarins Beztu Pylsur** (awesome hot dogs) and **Íslenski barinn** for dinner where we tried mink whale, puffin and hakarl (the fermented shark).
* **Airbnb**: We stayed at a very mediocre Airbnb that night and the following night in downtown Reykjavik.

**Day 2: Golden Circle**

* **Tour**: This whole day was occupied with a Golden Circle Tour with **Floating Tours.** This was a great experience. It was just my girlfriend and me, driven around by a tour guide by ourselves. The tour went to T**hingvellir National Park, Geysir, Gullfose Waterfall, Cafe Mika** (for dinner) and the **Secret Lagoon** (another geothermal pool) which we had to ourselves because the place was closed for the day. We tried some geothermal baked bread and boiled eggs in a hot spring and floated around the pool and saw the northern lights. Also ate some hakarl (its gross just do it once to complain about it later).

**Day 3: Thingvellir National Park**

* **Exploring**: We left Reykjavik and drove to **Thingvellir National Park** which we had briefly seen the day prior on the tour. This time we did snorkeling with **DIVE.IS** in Silfra. Silfra is the fissure between the two continental plates (North American and Eurasian) and is filled with very clear but very cold glacier runoff. We did the snorkeling which involved putting on dry suits with your hands and head in wetsuit material. The water was amazingly clear and beautiful and was a fun experience.
* **Hotel**: That night we stayed at **Hotel Borealis** which was a nice, quaint hotel with few rooms and a restaurant on site. 

**Day 4: Ring Road**

* **Driving**: This day consisted of a lot of driving. From Hotel Borealis in Sellfos we drove south on the **Ring Road** and hit all the major sights along the way. We stopped at the **Seljalandsfoss** and **Skógafoss** waterfall as well as the **Seljavallalaug** geothermal pool which is hidden from the road and a little walk to find. It was just slightly cold when we were there and didn’t stay long. We walked to the **Sólheimasandur** Plane Crash, a crashed DC plane from the 70s, definitely cool. The road to it was blocked when we went so we had to walk the few miles each way. After we drove to **Vik** and by that time only had time for a quick dinner and we turned ariound.
* **Airbnb**: We stayed at an Airbnb on off the ring road that was also a horse farm.

**Day 5: Ring Road Back**

* **Driving**: We only had time in the morning to wake up, have breakfast and hit the road back to Keflavik airport to hit our return flight. 


**Final Notes:** This is not nearly enough time as one should give themselves when going to Iceland but life sometimes restricts what we are able to do. I am very happy with the itinerary we had in the given time and don't think I would change anything. Any questions feel free to ask.","['I am from Iceland (Live in Reykjavik), seems like you hit most of the ""must see"" places in the south, but there are many great places in the east and north Iceland as well. \n\nTourism is booming last few years and it\'s quite expensive imo to be here, any plans on going back ?', 'We’re planning a trip to Iceland next year and this has been very helpful.

You could see a few of the ""touristy"" spots and maybe stay at an Airbnb to cut down on costs.', 'That is accurate. \n\nI think tourism is getting out of hand, the rent market is getting more and more ridiculous and owners are making apartments into expensive airbnb apartments instead of renting them out to locals, why?

50,Airline ticketed us incorrectly...any recourse,0,d67e3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/d67e3z/airline_ticketed_us_incorrectlyany_recourse/,25,1568887470.0,"I booked tickets on Iberia's website and got email email confirmation of my purchase and an emailed receipt for that flight.

Got to the airport today and found out that despite the email confirmation, they ticketed us for a flight that was 6 hours earlier. End result was that we missed our flight. Iberia was unwilling to rebook us because according to their system, we were always on the earlier flight. They refuse to consider the confirmation email I got from them showing that they ticketed us in error.

So we're out like $2k all in. Do we have any recourse at all?

Edit: a bit of clarification. The flight booked on Iberia was operated by AA. But it seems very much like a a website error where the flight we booked online didn't really exist.

Edit 2: Thank you for all the comments. So after multiple calls with Iberia and American Airlines (the operator of the flight) adding entries into out PNR indicating such, Iberia rebooked us to a flight today. We're gonna miss our friends wedding and are out a few hundred from missed trains after the flight, but so it goes. The surprise this morning was that despite confirming the rebooking last night, Iberia cancelled the entire itinerary this morning while we were sleeping. We had to call them his morning, and it took a bit of back and forth to get the tickets reissued, with Iberia claiming that AA cancelled the flights, and AA insisting that they didn't do anything. What a nightmare...anyway, now we just hope that the itinerary doesn't get cancelled during our trip...

Edit 3: For the sake of clarity, this is the sequence of events:

1. Booked tickets departing the US to Frankfurt leaving at 18:35 on 9/18, and returning back to the US on 9/24. Flights purchased on Iberia.com but operated by AA.

2. Received email confirmation with correct itenerary, confirmation of booking, and payment receipt

3. Went to try and check in online the day before the flight but got an error saying ""see desk agent"" or some such. My mistake here was not to look specifically at the departure times (Iberia's website has these hidden in collapsing menus, but I was just sloppy regardless).

4. Get to airport at 14:00 on 9/18, told that we are late for our flight, as booking shows we were ticketed on a US->FRA flight leaving at 12:35 on 9/18

5. Call Iberia, telling them we have email confirmation showing a discrepancy between our email itinerary and the ticketed itinerary from the airport

6. Iberia reps tell us the we need to get AA to ""add a note to the PNR"" for them to do anything, else we have to pay $5000 per ticket to change itinerary.

7. AA desk agents were amazing and added a note, told us that they suspect Iberia ticketed us incorrectly, and allowed us to purchase a flight different from the one that they ticketed.

8. 3 hours later (after all flights have departed for the day), Iberia finally sees the note added by AA agents and rebooks us on US->FRA flights for 9/20 (today at the time of writing), with the same return flights as our original itenerary.

9. At 6:20AM this morning, Iberia cancels our entire booking. We call in, speak to the rep. She claims AA flights have been rescheduled, we tell her that they are not rescheduled as per the AA website, she then says AA cancelled the itinerary. We insist this is not the case, and she calls AA, who tell her they did nothing. 20 minutes later, she rebooks us on the itinerary.","[""Is there any possibility you were rescheduled onto the earlier flight?\n\nSpeak with someone else.

51,My long weekend with American Airlines,5,3auc2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3auc2e/my_long_weekend_with_american_airlines/,25,1435104109.0,"My wife and I had planned a trip to El Paso this weekend from Raleigh. The plan called for leaving Thursday at 6 PM and landing in El Paso at 11, with a layover in Chicago, with a similar return trip on Sunday.  My wife was the maid of honor for a wedding, so we were looking forward to the trip.

Unfortunately, it started with some problems.  Our flight on American Airlines was delayed leaving Raleigh due to *maintenance issues with the aircraft* (According to customer service, the flight was delayed to air traffic control, however, when we landed in Chicago the desk attendant told us while giving us the hotel for the forced layover that the delay was due to maintenance, so I don't know for sure if it was ATC or maintenance).  Why not check all the maintenance items before the plane is scheduled to take off? When we asked the person at the desk if we would miss our connecting flight, we were told that the connecting flight would probably be delayed too, so we would make it in time.  
  
We landed in Chicago and RAN to the gate our next flight was set to leave from.  They had closed the jetway, but the plane was still sitting right there at the gate.  They wouldn't let us on. It sat there a while.  No flights out until tomorrow at 3 PM.  They gave us a hotel 40 minutes away and vouchers for dinner, breakfast, and lunch.  The hotel was actually pretty nice.  The Wyndham Glenview Suites. They also put us on standby for a 10AM flight so that maybe my wife could catch some of the day-before-wedding bridesmaid activities and possibly make the rehearsal and dinner.  
  
No luck on the standby in the morning.  We asked if they could split us up and get even 1 seat on an earlier flight so she could make it.   They put her on a noon flight to Denver to connect to El Paso.  She got on the plane and sat at the gate for almost an hour.  Apparently the **captain had ""refused to fly the plane""** so they had to get another captain to come fly it...  ok.  Off she went, and somehow made her connecting flight in Denver.  She missed the rehearsal, hair, nails, some other stuff, but caught the tail end of the rehearsal dinner.  Meanwhile, I was stuck in Chicago until 3 PM. Oh, I forgot to mention that this 3 PM flight would route me through ATLANTA with a very short layover.  **3 PM flight got delayed due to maintenance issues with the aircraft** - again, why are these planes apparently falling apart?  
  
Get booked for an 830 direct flight to El Paso from Chicago.  I get on the plane.  Then I'm **held at the gate for over an hour** because *""the maintenance crew filled out the paperwork wrong so they have to come back and fix it""* and then *""Well, they came back and fixed it, but then they took the book with them so they have to bring it back...""*  
  
I get in to El Paso over 24 hours later than originally scheduled.  The wedding was beautiful.  Ok, time for the return trip.  Amazing how short a trip is when you spend so long on an unexpected layover.  
  
So we are flying El Paso - Chicago - Raleigh to get home.  Short delay once we board the aircraft... *paperwork, or maintenance, or something,* not really sure.  About half an hour at the gate.  Then we get out to the runway and are just sitting there not taking off.  Flight attendant: ""**We are just a little too heavy to take off right now, so we are going to just burn off some jet fuel to lose weight**"" - yes. Seriously. Ok, ten minutes later: *""Sorry folks, but we have to turn off the AC to divert power to the engines for takeoff, but the switch to divert the power from the AC isn't working, so we are going to have maintenance come out to the runway to fix it.""*  Fifteen more minutes: *""Sorry again for the delay, but the crew is unable to fix the problem here on the runway so we are going **back to the terminal to deplane.**""*  
  
Back to the terminal, off the plane, my wife is livid, I am angry.  We are going to miss our connection home.  Ask at the desk for any other flights - *""Can't, all other flights are full that would get you home, so we'll put you overnight in Chicago.""* F''''ing seriously?  Fine.  We leave the desk, my wife calls AA customer service and they are able to get us on one of those ""full"" flights - but only if we can get on it **RIGHT NOW**.  But wait, there's more! They made us check our carry on luggage under the plane that doesn't work, so we can't get on the other plane RIGHT NOW unless we leave our unmarked luggage going somewhere else.  The lady on the phone tells us ""Just leave your bags...""  LOLWHUT??  ok no, we'll just stay stuck in Chicago.

So after over 3 and a half hours delayed, we take off to Chicago.  They didn't actually give us hotel vouchers in El Paso because ""you have to get them in Chicago."" Fine.   Side note: One cool thing that happened because of the delay: We saw Air Force One flying near us somewhere over the middle of the country.  That was cool.  
  
Anyways, we land in Chicago with no way to get home to Raleigh that night.  Captain: *""The gate we were supposed to go to is taken up by another plane... so we are going to taxi a little bit.... ...""*  That's right, we got **stuck on the plane after landing.** For almost half an hour.  Fine, so we get off the plane at some random gate.  We go to ask the lady at the desk to help us with our hotel vouchers, but she is too busy to talk to us.  *""I'm sorry, I have to take care of this other flight that is about to start boarding, so I don't have time to deal with your problems.""*  I ask if there is an AA customer service center somewhere - *""Just go to an empty desk at a terminal without a flight getting ready to board.""*  I ask if there is a customer service center with a manager or person other than just a desk agent - she refuses to answer my question and just says that she is busy.  ... ok...

My wife and I go to another desk where they are helping a couple other stranded passengers from our flight.  It takes them half an hour to find a hotel this time.  It's not nearly as nice as the one they put us in the first time.  Elk Grove Hotel. Our agent didn't give us any food vouchers, so we press him.  He gives us dinner.  What about breakfast, man?  ""It only comes with dinner...""  - No. No. 1. We just did this the other day. 2. The guy next to us just got breakfast.  Guy to other agent: ""Did you just give out breakfast?"" ""Yeah"" ""Ok, here you go.""  -  They gave us lunch last time, but we didn't press it.  Hour waiting for the shuttle.  Half hour to the hotel.  Finally some sleep.  
  
Wake up, my wife's birthday.  Elk Grove Hotel in Chicago wasn't exactly what we had in mind.  No work for either of us I guess.  Back to the airport.  The flight actually left on time and we made it home!  WOOOO!!!


To summarize:
---------------------------

* Between the two of us we had boarding passes for 11 flights instead of 4  
* 4 Maintenance delays experienced  
* 1 Delay due to pilot refusing to fly the plane  
* 1 Delay because they had to ""burn off jet fuel to lose weight""  
* 0 weather delays  
* Over 100 combined hours of traveling instead of ~22 (total for both)  -  I spent **57 hours traveling** instead of the 11 it should have taken - losing most of my actual vacation.  Fortunately, I did make the actual wedding.
* We each missed a day of work  
* When my wife said on the phone to them that this was all f'''ing b'''''it, she was told to ""keep it professional.""  I still haven't figured out what they think ""professional"" means.  
* I can't think of a much more frustrating way to spend $900.

They're already in Alicante for the month. I am planning on purchasing my flight (LGA-MAD) using American Airlines frequent flyer miles. Since I'm likely leaving sometime between Saturday-Monday (days from now), my flight options are limited and AA won't get me to Alicante.

So, I have 2 options:
1) Budget airline (Air Europa)
2) High speed train

It's not hard getting from MAD to the train station (I've done the trip often), but there are budget flights that would get me in on time to catch my AA flight. 

**What I'm not sure about is if they would transfer my luggage or not since they aren't partners, or if I would have to exit the terminal, get my bags, then check back into American?** If that's the case, there isn't time enough.

53,Trip Report: Aeroflot,23,7wbm66,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7wbm66/trip_report_aeroflot/,25,1518186490.0,"Thought I'd write this up as it's rare to see a review of an airline that's not a response to a question or a response to a negative experience.  When we bought tickets with Aeroflot I was slightly apprehensive that their Soviet reputation was going to be a reality and a lot of reviews backed that up.  I did read [this](https://flight-report.com/en/report/21622/Aeroflot-SU263-Tokyo-NRT-Moscow-SVO) which is very similar to what we experienced on the same route.

We flew Rome-Moscow SVO- Tokyo NRT and returned Tokyo-Moscow-London LHR with tickets we got for £250 each (thanks to Scott's Cheap Flights!).  We checked in one bag each, and check in at Rome was very quick.

On the shorter legs there was no IFE, but plenty of legroom so having the traytable down to watch netflix on the iPad wasn't an issue.  The flight from Rome was pleasant and we got a meal that compared favourably to the likes of KLM, BA etc and was much better than anything I've had on American.  The salad included smoked salmon and the rye bread was nice.  Not a fan of the Russian beer they served and I wish I'd tried the Russian berry drink! A blanket and pillow was provided even though it was a daytime flight of less than 4hrs and we arrived on time at SVO.

At SVO we disembarked quickly and went through a passport check and bag scan.  This was for transit (no visa required to stay in the airport).  In the terminal there were a few places to eat including a lot of coffee shops, Burger King, TGI Fridays, and more upstairs (in the terminal F area).  We chose to try the [Uzbek food](http://uzbechka.info/en/) which was absolutely delicious!

The flight from SVO to Narita also boarded on time and had a lot of empty seats.  We received slippers and an eye mask along with the blanket and pillow and again the cabin crew were friendly and polite.  The IFE was good, nice range of movies including new releases and a special section of past Oscar winners so I managed to watch three films on the journey - a lot less censored than on Qatar!  Two meals were served and I was happy to hear the announcement requesting that all passengers keep seats in the upright position during the meal service.  Ice cream was served between meals and there was a selection of chocolate and savoury biscuits available in the galley throughout.  Cabin crew also regularly walked through with juice and water which was much appreciated and much more frequent that on other airlines I've flown with recently. 

The interior of the plane was fresh and clean and the toilets were regularly cleaned and air freshened.  Toothbrush sets were available, though some hand cream would have been a nice addition.  Luggage was on the carousel soon after arrival but we did spend a long time taxiing in Narita before we got to the gate.

The return leg was a little different.  We arrived at Narita two hours before departure and found that out flight had been delayed by two hours.  The check in queue took a very long time (around two hours!) which was frustrating, however when we got to the front we were informed that due to weather in Moscow our connection had been delayed from 8pm to 8am the next morning.  Annoying, but we did get a 500 yen voucher and the check in staff were arranging everyone's new tickets.  In hindsight I'm glad of this as it meant the desks at SVO didn't have to go through this task! 

After a bumpy flight over the north of Russia we landed in the snowiest airport I've ever seen.  It turns out that Moscow had received the 'snowfall of the century' and that flights were all delayed as a result.  We received 2000 roubles in vouchers which was enough to buy dinner at TGI Friday's and breakfast and snacks at a coffee shop in the morning.  The staff at the information desk were obviously very stressed and their customer service was very direct (seems like that's how it is in Russia), but I felt for them as there was nothing they could really do to help.  There is one transit hotel and once that was full they couldn't accommodate any more people, although they made it clear that they would do their best for anyone with kids (didn't see any so maybe they got rooms).  The behaviour of some passengers was completely unreasonable...one woman complaining that her human rights were being violated and that she was going to call the embassy who I'm sure would have no sympathy.  So, lesson learnt - be aware that without a visa you'll likely be sleeping in the airport if you have an overnight delay.  There were pay-to-use sleep pods and a capsule hotel which were both full and some areas where the chairs didn't have armrests so plenty people were seen having a good sleep.  I heard regular updates about flight changes so communication was quite clear and all staff spoke English.

The flight to Heathrow left in the morning at its new time, went smoothly and had the same amenities as the Rome-Moscow leg, and arrived promptly.  We left Terminal 4 within 45 mins of touching down and got the tube into central London.

Overall, I was happy with Aeroflot and would fly with them again.  Considering the situation on the return leg was out of their control, I thought we were treated fine and it was understandable that there wasn't more they could do.  The entertainment was good and the food was decent.  Their company image was a bit sexist (definitely employ female cabin crew - who all seemed extremely competent -  based on looks and their legs featured heavily on the promotion videos) but a world away from the communist airline I'd heard about!  That said, the uniform still features a hammer and sickle :)

TLDR; Don't be scared of Aeroflot, but be aware of the Russian winters","['Long, long time ago, a friend of mine found cheap flights to Asia with Aeroflot. Being a bit ditzy, she didn’t realised it routed via Kabul, then under Soviet occupation. She reckoned the terminal was a right dump, but the scariest bit was taking off as flares were shooting out around the plane to put off heat-seeking missives. ', 'Thanks for sharing.

1. Should I worry about my luggage? I do remember it gets transferred automatically but want to double-check. 

2. Is 2,5h enough for transfer at Schiphol? 

3. I have heard about Aeromexico being really scammy and hard to deal with at MEX, are there any scams or things I should be wary of the most? The flight is booked with KLM but operated by aeromexico. 

My return  journey is through ATL (I have a WVP) will 2,5 hours be enough for transfer? Also I read about the need to collect and check in your luggage, is that true in US airports? 

The second part I want to ask about are the customs in the central american countries, I have read that to enter mayan ruins I will need long trousers, are shorts acceptable in cities? Do a lot of people wear hats? Should I be wary of anything? 
What essentials can you think of? I do have a flashlight and money bag, and will buy mosquito and sun sprays. Is there anything else I should have?

Given that you're out of LAX and already fly American, you might consider OneWorld Alliance as well. That's my setup (LAX/American) and I've been reasonably satisfied. The 3 big airlines/alliances have been somewhat in a race to the bottom and they all have fairly similar policies at this point, especially for domestic. So I'd say it largely depends on what hubs and locations you're looking for. \n\nStar Alliance seems to have better options in Africa, but other than that, I don't see a big difference. I've had pretty good luck with award tickets and upgrades using OneWorld for Asia, Europe, and even the Middle East. They've got some options in Africa as well, but it seems more hit and miss. ""]"

Cost is only $2, and you can use dollar bills (no transit ticket required).\n\n* I enjoyed a [""Creole & Crescent"" bike tour](http://www.neworleansbiketour.com/); I saw a lot of the city in a short time.\n\n* I also enjoyed a walking tour by [Two Chicks Walking Tours](http://www.twochickswalkingtours.com/index.html), the groups are small and the guides professional. They can be pricey, however.\n\n* The beignets at Cafe du Monde are famous; but some say the beignets at Morning Call in City Park are better (OK, it was my bike tour leader who told us that). Best approach: try both and decide for yourself.\n\n* A jazz show at Preservation Hall is kind of a ""bucket list"" thing; not cheap, though. These are old-time jazz musicians who really know their stuff. The setting is very informal.\n\n* Take the [St. Charles streetcar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles_Streetcar_Line) through the historic Garden District neighborhood for a cheap thrill\n\n* New Orleans is kind of a ""naughty"" town. If you want some naughty entertainment that is still ""nice"", check out the burlesque performer [Trixie Minx at One Eyed Jacks](http://www.trixieminx.com/shows.aspx).\n\n* There is plenty of jazz in the French Quarter, but I am told the more authentic and good music scene is on Frenchman Street, which is a bit further east.\n\n* The New Orleans Pharmacy Museum is a minor attraction, but interesting if you are interested in the history of medicine. It\'s mostly just a bunch of old medicine bottles with explanatory signs, in a historic old pharmacy building. It\'s the kind of thing I really liked, but probably not for everyone. Only five bucks, IIRC.\n\n* Have a  Sazerac cocktail at the historic Hotel Monteleone\'s famous rotating carousel bar\n\n* You can, and should, visit the historic cemeteries, but you need to sign up for an organized tour. The bike tour mentioned above does stop briefly in a cemetery.', ""No problem.

59,"Advice Needed: ""Low Stress"" First International Trip with S.O. that Still Feels ""Foreign""",2,57yw60,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/57yw60/advice_needed_low_stress_first_international_trip/,24,1476757155.0,"I hope this is not too vague, but I will try to give details on what I am looking for, and any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Love browsing this sub.

**Who:** I am in the process of booking a trip for my fiancee and me for early May. We are mid twenties and live in New York.

**Past Travel:** My fiancee has never been out of the US and is the main reason why I want to take an international trip. I have been to Croatia/Hungary, United Arab Emirates and Germany. I would like to try something new.

**Length/Budget:** ~ 1 Week, ~2000 dollars (Not including Airfare). I should note that I have a ton (~200k Mileage plus Miles) and am practiced in getting rewards flights so airfare costs should be minimal.

**All Inclusive vs City Travel:** Here is my number one question. I want to travel somewhere that has a ""foreign feel"", but I do not want to have the whole backpacking feel to it either. For example, I did Berlin/Budapest/Zagreb and really enjoyed that trip, but think it will be too much for my S.O.

I want a relaxing vacation such as one you find in the Caribbean at a chain ""All Inclusive"" resort, but I still want to feel like I am out of the country. I hope this makes sense. My fear is that if I go to the Carribean, I will not have that same ""foreign feel"" that I had when I was in Croatia or UAE.

I guess what I am asking of is a single stop (no multi-city), vacation which will certainly feel like I am far away from NYC, but at the same time I do not want to be in a different city every 2 days running around from hotel to hotel sticking to a very packed sightseeing itinerary.

**Interests:** I have a strong interest in history and architecture. Fiancee is has a conversational command over Spanish, and I have very basic French.

**Current Ideas:** Right now I am thinking about Greece, France (non-Paris), or a less ""commercialized"" Central American Country. I am all over the place though, I need some refinement.
Any suggestions for a low-stress* vacation that still has more of an ""international"" feel to it than something in Jamaica or Dominican Republic would have?

Please let me know if you have any questions and I appreciate any suggestions.

60,Frequent Flyer Award Ticket Question,9,gfud6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/gfud6/frequent_flyer_award_ticket_question/,24,1301636174.0,"My boyfriend and I were planning to take a two-week trip to Uruguay and Argentina at the beginning of October, using American Airlines frequent flyer miles to cover the flights. I have about 105,000 miles and there are two award classes that might apply to us: MileSaver Off-peak (20,000 per person each way, so 80,000 total) and Anytime (60,000 per person each way, so not really usable). For various reasons, our travel dates really aren't flexible. When I checked AA's website, it looks like there are no Milesaver seats available for the days we need to travel. (And for the days that do have MileSaver awards, there's a ridiculous 12+ hour layover.)

Is it possible that the situation might be different if I actually call the airline? Does the website show all available options, or are there different ones if I call? Can I get anywhere by begging and pleading, or are we just screwed?","['There is a very, very, small chance you could get somewhere by begging and pleading, but it\'s most likely not going to happen. The problem is that the seats on any flight are divided into what are called ""fare buckets"" and one of the buckets is reserved for reward travel. When all the seats are gone in that bucket, no more reward seats exist. Sometimes, airlines hold seats out of that bucket until closer to travel. \n\nIf you get lucky and get an extremely nice agent on the phone they might be able to get revenue to release an additional seat to that bucket. Try booking just one seat and see if the availability increases. Also try alternate manual routings too.\n\nThe other option is to wait until closer to the day of travel. I got a great business class redemption TPAC for 100k which *never* happens but it was available a week in advance, so I cancelled my full-fare J and booked with miles and got reimbursed for the ticket anyways by my employer :)\n\nTo be perfectly honest, economy redemptions are usually not worth it. At most you are getting around 1c/mi, which is a pretty crappy redemption rate. I am not sure what the mile cost for a business class ticket is, but if it\'s say 50k each way (discounted) you would stand to gain much more value for your miles. 5-6c+/mi. \n\nI would suggest just paying cash for the lowest fare available and banking the miles until there is a great redemption opportunity available if you can\'t get AA to get you the seats for 80k round trip.', 'Availability changes all the time.  Call to check to see if any partner airlines have availabilities, change your cities and dates if able as well.  I\'m not sure about the South American partners, but some of the European partners do not show availability on the website. Call often.\n\nCoach class international awards aren\'t anywhere near as good of a use of miles as business/first class rewards and there are often saver business class tickets at a great rate available when coach seats aren\'t.  Don\'t forget to check for regular cash tickets too.\n\nPersonally, I only redeem miles if I can ""sell"" them back to the airline for at least $0.05/mile and I like to get $0.07/mile.  This threshold is much easier to reach in premium cabins.', 'You can also call American to see if there is availability on one of their partner airlines; both GOL and LAN fly to Buenos Aires.  Also check if there is American availability into Santiago or Sao Paulo and connect from there.', ""Check weekly. Call to check their partners too.\n\nAirlines don't release the seats too far in advance. They prefer cash over miles for tickets. \n\nI also found the the best options open up a couple months before you are going. They open up more seats for awards later in the game when they realize they won't sell as many cash seats.\n\nI know this is generalize info but it's true. I had crazy layovers and routing on Delta partners last year and was able to call about 1-2 months before my actual travel to get more direct flights. I had to pay a reticketing fee but $150 (in Delta's case) was well worth not burning a day each way in airports.\n\nWe work hard for our vacations! Make the most of the time you have off!"", 'This is a dead horse, but the value you get for your miles is not the full price of a ticket, but what you would pay for it. For this reason, for me at least, economy redemptions are a better value, especially when I frequently fly a trans-con route that costs $400+. Of course, I use your reasoning when I want to ""splurge"" on a trip w/ miles, but I know in my heart it\'s a little disingenuous. ', ""Thanks for the reply!\n\nWhat's sad is that I had been checking availability base don one seat instead of two, so when I switched to two tickets (since that's the number I need), I proceeded to get even more screwed. I also tried cutting out our feeder airport and just going from/to LAX, but no luck. Seriously, who is booking these freaking flights that far in advance??? (Besides me...) Not having tickets until the last minute makes me a little jittery, so I'm not sure if I could do that.\n\nOne other thought I had was that we might be able to use the points on another airline in the OneWorld Alliance (like LAN). Maybe they will still have seats available.\n\nI'll call and see what happens. I *knew* it was naive to think that I could actually get our flights for (nearly) free on the right days. :("", ""I hadn't really thought about it before, but you're 100% right—business class award tickets are a MUCH better value. If we can't swing free airfare for this trip, I may just hoard my miles so that we can fly business class to Ireland next year (hopefully). I've never flown business class before, so doing it on an award ticket would be extra awesome!"", ""Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking! I'm going to see if I can get there and back (to LAX at least) on LAN."", ""Thanks for the info! Today I'm going to call LAN (which is partnered with American) and see if I can get award tickets through them. If I can't, then I guess I'll have to play the waiting game and hope for the best (because there's no way in hell I'm paying the $1650 per person they're charging right now for an economy ticket)."", ""I don't really fly much (maybe one US trip and one international trip each year), so I figure I'd get more value on an international flight than a domestic one.\n\n(Actually, I have a domestic trip I need to book too, and I'm hoping to do that with a free companion fare coupon I have—I wonder how much of a pain in the ass *that* will be...)"", ""It's not necessarily people booking in advance, but simply the number of reward tickets the airline's revenue control is releasing on a given route.

I learned a lot from all these replies though, so it wasn't a total loss."", 'Also a good option!\n\nI am looking to book a biz class award to SE Asia using AA miles myself as soon as they hit my account (credit card bonus). \n\nHave fun wherever you end up going!', 'Thanks!

61,American Airlines and Me,23,210i3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/210i3r/american_airlines_and_me/,24,1395453824.0,"As a manager in a fairly large organization I typically hesitate to malign a business for the actions of some of their employees. That said, I am incredibly aggravated by my recent experience with American Airlines. I am writing this while on hold with Central Baggage Services.  Let's see if I can get it all typed before somebody answers. 

Last month I went on my honeymoon. I purchased a Groupon travel voucher to Ireland that included airfare, car rental, and accommodations. The day after my wedding my wife and I reported to JFK airport to board our flight. As I began to swipe my passport at the check-in kiosk I was stopped by a ticket agent who told me he would swipe my passport for me. About three years ago I returned from a trip and put my jeans (and also my passport) in the washing machine.  While it isn't in the best condition, I have never had any problems traveling internationally with it. The ticket agent swiped it through the machine a couple of times and then said he had to take it to his supervisor.  I told him not to worry, that I could swipe it through just fine but he refused to return my passport. I followed him to his supervisor who mashed the passport into his scanner and dragged it through. The computer couldn't read his swipe so he informed me that I would not be able to fly on his airline until I had a new passport.  I asked him for my passport back and walked over to an unmanned kiosk.  I swiped the passport in the kiosk which was able to read it just fine and allowed me to check in. I then took my luggage over to the desk. The supervisor ran over and told the agent that I was not allowed to check my luggage in.  After presenting him with my boarding passes he began to argue with me about the company's policy regarding passports that could not be scanned.  I told him that I wasn't arguing the policy. I had successfully scanned my passport and had successfully checked in. I would take my chances with customs in Dublin. Finally, after an hour, my new wife and I were able to check our bags and go through security. We were stressed because we knew our flight would begin boarding soon but relief came when we noticed the flight was actually delayed 45 minutes.  We confirmed the delay status with the gate agent and then toddled off to Auntie Anne's to get a pretzel (because Auntie Anne's is the only place anybody should ever buy a pretzel). We enjoyed our pretzel and relaxed for thirty minutes before returning to our gate. As we approached the gate we noticed that the seats were all empty. We went to the gate agent desk and were notified that the plane didn't need to be delayed after all so they had boarded and closed the door.  Even though the airplane was still out there, they couldn't let us on. We were told we would have to go to baggage claim to get our luggage which was being pulled off the aircraft. During those few minutes several other people came to the gate, discovering that they too had missed the flight. 

My wife and I were frustrated and tried to get on another flight to Dublin. American airlines only flies to Dublin 3 times a week and they said we would not be able to fly there with them. They said we could pay $1600 each to take the British Airways flight that left a couple hours later. That was all they would recommend. 

My wife and I went down to baggage claim to pick up our bags. We found her suitcase right away. Mine was nowhere to be found. During my previous job as a teacher, I traveled dozens of times throughout the US, South America, Europe, and Asia. I never left home without my trusty Kelty backpack. This pack and I have been through a lot together and as I stood at the JFK baggage claim I knew that I probably wasn't going to see it again. I went to the claim area and spoke with the attendant who told me that my bag had been pulled off the flight but was in a room that had been locked.  Anybody who had a key to that room had already gone home for the night. This was at 9:30 PM. She told me that I could come back in the morning to claim it.  I told her that I just wanted it shipped back to my house in Los Angeles since I had no idea what I was going to do next with my travel plans. She told me that she couldn't do that and to call the 1-800 number to file a claim. 

My wife and I then went to British Airways to try and work something out that would get us to Ireland. The lady who helped us (Carole) was amazing. She was truly an angel. She got us on that night's flight for $300. We will name our first child after her.

Upon arriving in Dublin, I called the 1-800 number to file a claim. The told me that my bag was at the Dublin airport and I could retrieve it there. That said, the American Airlines counter in the Dublin airport is only open for 6 hours three days a week. I would have to wait two days to talk to somebody there. So I went to the store and purchased a couple days worth of clothes and my wife and I set off on our adventure. 

A couple days later I called the American Airlines desk at the Dublin airport. They told me that they did not have my bag, that it was held at JFK. Frustrated I told them that I just wanted it sent back to LA. They recommended I pick it up on my return flight into JFK. So I bought a week's worth of ill fitting European clothes and enjoyed the remainder of my trip.

Upon landing at JFK a week later, I received a voicemail from American Airlines in Dublin telling me that my backpack was there in the airport. I went to the AA baggage claim desk and told them I just wanted the bag mailed home. They told me they could not do that there and that I would need to call the 1-800 number that I am currently still on hold with. My call is very important to them. Good to know. 

I flew home to LA and called the number, filing a claim. They told me they had located my bag in Dublin but I needed to call them back when the Dublin airport's American Airlines desk is open. That would be between 11 PM and 5 AM my time. 

The next time I called they told me that they could not find my bag. I gave them the record locator ID and they told me they had no bag connected to that ID in the system. Now I'm on hold waiting for a supervisor. Good times.

TL;DR: American Airlines has poor customer service, lost my bag, had some more poor service, found my bag, lost it again, continues to have poor service. ","[""Does American have Twitter-based customer service? Last summer, Delta decided I would not make my connection in Paris so my bag did not need to travel. They underestimated my ability to run and the connection's penchant for being delayed. I called the 800# and was told my bag would be flying out that day. Three days later. Bag still in Atlanta. Same story when I called.\n\nTweeted @DeltaAssist...45 mins later a call back from the head of global baggage operations center and a firm promise that my bag would arrive the next day. It did.  So try Twitter if calling is not giving you satisfaction."", ""I had a similar experience recently.  Went to the ticket counter, asked to be same-day standby and was told the system wouldn't let them.  Took a ticket for the next day instead (weather delays)....guy behind me (who got the other agent working that time) was able to get both the next day ticket AND a standby ticket.  I waited back in line, and luckily just as it was my turn the previous agent (who said I couldn't do it) left for break and I got the agent that made it happen.\n\nAirlines really do need to improve their agent customer service.  Honestly they all seem like old, cranky folks that hate the world :("", ""It's not American's fault you weren't in the gate area at departure time.. even with a delay.  The luggage thing is certainly an issue, but you should have gotten BA to transfer your luggage for you.  When you didn't board your AA flight they would have unloaded the bags in JFK."", ""What an absolute nightmare. At least you eventually got to Ireland, though, and American Airlines didn't completely ruin your honeymoon.\n\nThis is hardly the first time I've heard horror stories about that airline. I primarily fly with Delta (or its SkyTeam partners) and have yet to have any similarly bad experiences. Not to say they're a *good* airline, either, but if you have to fly with one of the big US airlines, Delta is probably the way to go."", ""This is horrible.

Last week we had an 8 hour delay on our flight to LA and missed our connection to Maui.  Over X-mas my connecting flight to Heathrow enroute to Barcelona was cancelled.

63,Airline loyalty programs.... useless for leisure travelers?,1,9d3vfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9d3vfi/airline_loyalty_programs_useless_for_leisure/,22,1536158810.0,"Ok, so, this may be a very stupid question, but please forgive my ignorance and help answer a question I’ve been pondering for a few years now.

I travel quite a bit — my wife and I are fortunate to be able to spend 2-3 months of the year abroad traveling for leisure. We’ll probably log around 30 flights in 2018 (6-7 long haul international, the rest mostly medium or short haul international and a few regional) with 1-2 business legs, the rest prem economy or economy.  

I’ve always booked fights myself using Kayak and Google Flights, concerned primarily with price and flight quality (I hate red eyes and ultra low cost carriers).... and therefore I end up booking with a ton of different airlines each year, never earning any good loyalty rewards with any one airline or alliance.  

For example, my long haul legs this year will be with Air Canada (YVR to HKG, BNE to YVR, YVR to SCL) combined with a handful of regional flights doesn’t earn me diddly squat in Air Canada’s Latitude rewards program (not enough to reach status for upgrades, lounge access, and other perks).  Unfortunately I also fly locally (ie. YVR to CGY, YVR to MEX) on WestJet due to far lower fares, and to places/routes not served by Air Canada/Star Alliance partners (ie. BUE to CUN, MNL to AKL) but none of those flights earned me any AC Latitude points.  I’ve booked with Icelandair, Avianca, Aeromexico, Cathay, Alaska, American, Jetstar, etc so that’s a smattering of OneWorld and Star Alliance

... _raging_

*Does anyone have a way around this?* Or *do airline loyalty programs only really benefit the travelers buying flexible fare tickets on their employer’s dime?*

*Is there any airline loyalty rewards programs that reward accrued lifetime cumulative miles rather than annual ‘miles flown’ minimums that reset every 365 days?*

I just yearn for a way to combine my spending / miles to earn upgrades and other perks of loyalty status without having to pay for many higher priced fares to always fly with one airline or network.....  

Many thanks in advance, travel gurus...    _bows_","['In my personal experience, you can either focus on cheaper price or on loyalty.

65,We're dreaming of a White Christmas! Our tickets are already booked and we arrive New York on December 17th. Where do we go from NYC to get ourselves a Christmas experience?,1,2gu2f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2gu2f9/were_dreaming_of_a_white_christmas_our_tickets/,23,1411132280.0,"Hi all!

My wife and I are Australian tourists (mid 30s).  We've booked our airline tickets but that's as far as we've planned! :)

We are looking for some advice/thoughts on where to go in the USA to have a high probability of a white Christmas. We really also want that good christmas 'feeling' (food, wine, town, community, events etc).

Schedule wise, we're pretty tight on time:

* We will be hanging around in NYC starting December 17 until December 21/22 
* [ train/bus/fly/drive to our Christmas fantasy land ] 
* **'White' Christmas side trip from December 22 until 25/26th**
* back to NYC late on December 26th
 
We're not limiting ourselves to New York state, we've heard that several states have high snow probability around that time of the year:

* Maine
* Vermont
* New Hampshire
* New York 

Edit: Currently we were leaning towards Vermont (based on feedback from a NYC local), and the Vermont Tourism websites. We were thinking Burlington or Montpelier, but we'd love to hear other people's experiences. We are also entertaining the idea of Portland, Maine - due to the high probability of snow.

Our style of touring:

* We are 'walking tourists' - we walk everywhere!
* We like experiencing the feel of a city - buildings, architecture & parks
* Enjoy good food, wine, and culture
* We were thinking something Air B&B style - though we are happy to stay anywhere from 5-Star hotels to Backpackers' hostels.
* We like meeting local people (NYC was great for talking to people in restaurants and bars!)
* Happy to hire catch planes, trains, busses or hire a car (though winter roads?)

Our 'vision' (fantasy?) is for a compact city/town that: has a (very?) high snow probability around Christmas; is easily walkable;  has a nice community feel; has a few days worth of restaurants and bars; is likely to be relatively ""open"" and accessible over the Christmas period.

Can any American locals suggest their states or towns? 

Have any other tourists had any great Christmas experiences around North East USA they'd like to share?

67,Need advice regarding a connecting international flight. First time solo flyer and very anxious!!!,6,7u4a6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7u4a6i/need_advice_regarding_a_connecting_international/,22,1517374936.0,"Hi Everyone!

I don't fly often and I have never flown internationally by myself.   I am flying home to Australia for a family event  in a couple of weeks and I have booked my flights through Qantas last week and only realized that I may have an issue now.

Here are my flights:

- American Airlines: Baltimore to JFK
- Qantas: JFK - LAX
- Qantas: LAX to MEL (Australia)

My concern is that I only have 1 hour and 10 mins from landing at LAX to get to the LAX international flight.  Is this enough time?  The JFK-LAX lands at Terminal B and the LAX-MEL departs from Terminal B (So I /think/ that's good?  I looked at the LAX map and Terminal B is in the international section).  

When I came to the USA from Australia there was a bit of a process to check in for the flight and getting my passports checked etc and I didn't have any connecting flights so I didn't have any issues.  I also flew with my husband which helped a lot!

SO!

Do I get my passport checked and everything at JFK or does it get done at LAX? Will I have enough time to go through Passport checking and stuff and get to the LAX-MEL flight?

I called Qantas and they said that 1h10m is the minimum amount of time for me to check in but if the plane is late then they will put me on a later flight BUT if I get lost getting to the gate or Passport control takes a bit longer then I have to buy a whole new flight.  Also - do I have to pick up my luggage or will Qantas automatically send it to MEL?

I have another thing: I was told that if I want to change the international flight it will cost $240 for the change fee and whatever the fare difference is.  I checked and there is a flight to MEL an hour and a half later which gives me 2 and a bit hours at LAX.  Is it worth changing and paying the fee and any fare difference to make sure I get there?

I am sorry for this big post.  I am just a little (a lot) stressed and I have a horrible fear of flying and flying alone is scaring me.  I'm worried I am going to get super frazzled and screw this up.

I was so careful when booking this and I don't know how I didn't see this and I feel like such an idiot so please don't remind me!

Do you guys have any advice?

You get off the plane, and proceed to the next gate. Nothing special. Your passport may (or may not) be checked at LAX, but it would be at the time of boarding.\n\nBecause of this, there is no ""international section"" of the airport. While there are a lot of international flights at the Tom Bradley terminal at LAX, they are not exclusively there, nor is every single flight from there international. One is free to walk to and from domestic flights at their leisure (as I have done myself to go to a lounge or just to kill time).\n\nIn any event, that\'s more information that you need. You have tons of time to get between your flights. Every passenger on the JFK to LAX flight *must* be connecting to another Qantas flight, and so in all likelihood the gates will be very close to each other. You get off, walk to that gate, and wait.

68,Trying to plan a trip to India for March/April. Had a couple questions.,3,138vzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/138vzr/trying_to_plan_a_trip_to_india_for_marchapril_had/,22,1353027225.0,"I'm going to India for a class through my university in March/April.  I'll be flying into Delhi.  We're spending 10 days seeing some temples, forts, tiger reserves, and vultures.  I would like to travel on my own after the class concludes before returning to the US.

I am planning on making a trip to Agra to see the Taj and the Fort.  I would also like to visit Pune (in order to see the college my grandfather attended).  I'm also tempted to visit Assam to see my grandfather's friend that lives there.  Do you think a week would be long enough for these side trips?

I'm curious about what an inexpensive hotel room or bed in a hostel will cost me?  And, are there any cheap airlines that I can fly safely between cities?   Is there a website that outlines daily cost of traveling in India?  I'm reading through IndiaMike now.

I'm asking because I found out I have to book my ticket this week (due to flying on air miles).  I really need to decide on dates for the flights.

Will I be safe traveling by myself?  Does it matter that I'm American?","['There would be 2 or 3 flights from Delhi to any large city in India every day. All airlines that I know of in India are pretty safe, but schedules are sometimes way off. Dont plan on any connecting flights without at least three or four hours of separation. Check cleartrip.com/yatra.com/makemytrip.com for cheap tickets.\n\nFrom Delhi, two days should be plenty to travel to Agra and back. Delhi to Pune and back another two days, and another 2-3 days to Assam. I am not sure where in Assam your friend lives, but roads are pretty bad in all of India, so a 300km trip can easily take the better part of a day. I would say, from Delhi to Assam, definitely take a flight. From Delhi to Pune, highly recommended to take a flight, and to Agra, try to take a train ride. But squeezing all of this in a week would really be a whirlwind trip.. no time to relax. Dont even think about driving there. You * will * die. \n\nHotels etc. are really pricey in India because of demand supply issues. I would not dare to stay at any place that took less than $100 a day. And these places would not be particularly luxurious, just your basic motel room. \n\nEat only cooked food, drink only bottled water, and always carry a bottle of hand sanitizer.  ', ""Yeah, the distances mean there is no way you can do this in a comfortable fashion without flying between cities, but you seem to have realized this already. Others here know more about India travel than I do, but if I was visiting Pune anyway, I'd probably spend my week there and in Mumbai."", 'Are you in a rush to return home, for school or anything like that?\n\nAccommodation varies, but I think you can spend as little as $3 to $20 on a basic room with a bed, sheets, fan, and lock on the door.', ""Thanks for all the advice!  \n\nI would just fly straight through, so if a flight was delayed or something, it wouldn't matter.  I don't think I'll take anything with a connecting flight if I can avoid it.\n\nMaybe I'll just do Agra and Pune.  I'm not sure where in Assam he is, or if my grandfather is still in touch with him.  I'll have to talk to him about it.  Do you think Agra would be too far of a drive?  It seems like 120 miles would take 2-4 hours at the most.  I was thinking it could be exciting to rent an Enfield.\n\nAre you talking $100 in US dollars or Rupees?  Looking on different travel sites, I'm not even seeing hotels for $100US a night.  Maybe 1 or 2 per city.\n\nThanks for the tips.  Is the food from street vendors safe?  "", ""I think the distance between Agra and Delhi can comfortably be done by train. Also, if you haven't been on a train in India you really missed something...There are usually night trains, too and I slept in them like a baby. Just remember to bring a chain and a padlock so you can secure your luggage under the seat (they also sell those things at the station and I've seen quite a few Indians do it, too. Still, India is one of the safest places as far as luggage theft is concerned, that I've ever been to.) We always booked sleeper class which is absolutely ok. The most important thing will be to bring a lot of change, because there will always (except in the middle of the night) be people on the train to sell food. Also, whenever you stop, chai vendors will come to the windows and you can get some. Seriously, don't miss riding a train in India! It's so much fun! "", ""I already knew I'd have to fly. I'm tempted to rent a motorcycle to drive to Agra, but who knows. What makes you suggest staying in Mumbai for the whole week?"", ""Yea.  The class portion of the trip is over spring break and my personal trip will be over the next week, so I'm already missing about 7 days of classes.\n\nLooks like we had to change the trip due to costs.  Looks like we'll only be in 2 tiger reserves and going to Agra as a group (over 8 days instead of 10).  So I may have a whole week to see Pune and possibly Assam.\n\nThanks! That's what I was figuring a hotel would probably cost.  Seems like you could easily make due on $15-20 per day very comfortably."", ""$100/night is way too much. There are perfectly serviceable hotels for significantly less. My hotels in Agra (within walking distance of the Taj Mahal) and Delhi were about $35/night, and the Delhi one included airport pickup! Agra is an easy train ride. Go look at videos on Youtube of driving in India before you decide on your motorcycle. If it doesn't freak you out, maybe you'll be ok. I wouldn't do it. :)\n\nStreet vendor food -- it varies. Chai is probably always ok. Samosas if you saw them making them, otherwise it could have been sitting around all day. Be aware of anything that could be washed in or contain unpurified water (including ice)."", 'Well.. may be the demand supply situation with hotels has eased up now. I am pleasantly surprised :-) Its not the length of the drive, its the trucks belching smoke in your face, the highways are not access controlled, so all sorts of random things on the road - cattle, horses, pigs, dogs, children, and they drive on the left side of the road.. I guess if you were in a group, it would still be OK, but I would not recommend someone from the US to try this by themselves. Especially not that stretch.. heavily populated, industrialized.

Mumbai is a huge city, I can't imagine running out of bits of it to poke around."", 'Some things cost more though, like visiting certain places (like the Taj, or UNESCO world heritage sites), transportation, food, sometimes only more pricy accommodation will be available, etc.). Keep that in mind!', ""I thought it would be. Did you stay in hostels while you where there?  That seems like it could be fun.\n\nThanks! I'll be careful about the food.  Went to Kenya last year and it sounds like the same rules apply."", ""I don't really have an interest in Mumbai though."", ""Definitely!  I don't plan on taking barely enough money to cover the trip.  Wouldn't want to get stranded there with nothing."", ""Didn't do hostels. Hotels were so cheap it wasn't necessary costwise, and I had enough social things scheduled that I didn't need to meet more people on this specific trip. I do stay in hostels normally, though.\n\nOh yeah, and regarding the flights, I flew Spice Jet and IndiGo and they were just fine (and inexpensive -- < $100 per leg). Smaller planes so I had to check my backpack. I think makemytrip.com had a promotion going on at the time so I got a few bucks off my hotel reservation for booking both a plane ticket and a hotel room through them.\n\nAnother word of advice is not to have things packed so tight on an India trip that a delay would ruin things for you. Cuz that stuff happens. "", ""It's a mega-city, there's always going to be many interesting things. But I realize that people who aren't me are often much more focused on seeing discrete sights rather than experiencing places, so fair enough. I like Yangon, for example, but I know this is a minority opinion."", 'Whew! Just making sure. Have a great time!', ""I was also thinking that I'd probably meet some cool people in hostels but the hotel room would probably be nice.\n\nThanks for the tip! I'll check those airlines out.\n\nI've heard that delays are standard practice there.  I won't stress about it. haha"", ""Well it looked like our trip has been redesigned so I'll be seeing Agra with the group.  I think I may spend 4 or 5 days in Pune to explore it.  "", ""Thanks!

69,Four weeks in USA - West - East - West,1,89ogut,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/89ogut/four_weeks_in_usa_west_east_west/,21,1522868535.0,"My wife, seven year old daughter and I will arrive in San Fransisco on 20 September, 2018 and leave the US via Los Angeles on 18 October, 2018.
Our itinerary is roughly:
San Fran 20/Sep - 24/Sep, arrive Washington 24/Sep via Alaska Airlines, arrive New York 27/Sep via Amtrak, arrive Boston on 1/Oct via Amtrak, depart Boston around 6/Oct for Cape Cod and the Island and also Vermont for the fall foliage (no motorhomes - just hiring a car and staying in the smaller towns), depart New England on 13 October and arrive in LA, go to Anaheim on 14 October and spend two days in Disney Land, arrive LA (Santa Monica) on 16 October for a couple of days prior to finally flying back home to Australia on 18 October at about 2300 hrs (11:00 PM).

Couple of questions:
1. Looking at accommodation in the US (and I appreciate we are staying in some busy/expensive places) we are finding about $350 AUD - $450 AUD is average for a double room (two queen beds). Is this legitimate or are there cheaper finds out there without living in a motel next to a strip club? I really wanted to live in AirBNBs in the US to get a feel for some of the lived in areas of the cities but I am finding AirBNB hard to deal with. Is it that the AirBNB availability is not able to forecast out to September? Are they all sold out? I think comparing Australian AirBNB and American AirBNBs the latter is more expensive and less impressive (quality-wise). Have experienced travellers got any comments on that?
2. For San Fran, Washington, and New York the day trips are pretty self-explanatory due to the short time we have in each. Could anyone give me any advice on the New England portion? The five-odd days I have in Boston-central I wanted to take in the Freedom trail tours, generally soak in the cosmopolitan vibe and hopefully book some New England Patriots pre-season tickets when Ticketek release them later this year. Getting one of the last MBL games at Fenway would be a blast too (although I wonder if October is too late for regular season games and whether post-season games would be sold out).
But once we look at going out to Cape Cod, Marthas Vineyard etc - is my plan solid to drive their from Boston and stay local? I am thinking about availability/quality of accommodation. And again whether I should give AirBNB another go or whether I am better off looking commercial. 
I also get the Vermont is to the North of Boston and may require me to drive back through to see the fall foliage and stay in some of the small towns along that scenic route. But if there are any quiet little towns with a quaint New England vibe and lots of orange leaves that would be fantastic.
3. Travelling back to LA we have realised the October dates for Disney Land are actually part of a weekend. Is Disney Land as crazy both weekend and week days? Or should be visit during weekdays for less line ups for rides? I ask this because we could flip our LA itinerary to spend more time in LA over that weekend and travel out o Anaheim during the week. Then we would be driving to the Airport on the 18th from DisneyLand to jump on the plane (hopefully exhausted) and sleep on the way back to Australia.

As an aside I did think about getting out to Yosemite during my four days around San Fran but have realised the 3 hour drive each way and the amount to see in Yosemite might render this ineffective. But I do worry four days is too much to do the Golden Gate bridge, see some coastal Sequoias, look at Alcatraz, and buy some Zinfandel from the wine country. Not looking to burn out my seven year old to recommendations on whether I am just not being brave enough with cutting away Yosemite?

Enough for now. Thanks in advance for reading through and letting me know your thoughts. I am really keen to see your recommendations re: accommodation as this seems the biggest expense. I went through Flight Centre (Australian travel agent chain) and it seemed their bookings were much more expensive that what I can get through Booking.com. But I am also wondering if the advertised price on the front page wqill be jacked up by taxes and booking fees once I get to the checkout? Anyone used Flight Centre and can tell me whether I will be paying for the privilege?

Cheers

No one will know what the postseason schedule will be until the season is over, and there's no guarantee that Boston will qualify.  Postseason games will be sold out, but you can always get tickets on the secondary market from Stubhub, but they'll probably cost at least a couple hundred dollars each.\n\nIf going to these sporting events is important to you, then you need to rearrange your itinerary.

Also look into downloading wait time apps so that you can see what has a long wait. Hit up the rides that are especially popular first thing in the morning and also look to get fast passes. Don’t be afraid to go back to your hotel and take a nap (if you’re staying close by) in the afternoon. This will give you more time to visit the parks later that night. The park tends to really clear out after the fireworks, so try to stay after that if your little ones aren’t too tired. The lines will be much shorter.\n\nI live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have. Personally, I think the city can be done in a day or two. You can use the extra time to go south, you might like Monterey (the Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the best in the world!). Half Moon Bay, Santa Cruz/Capitola are cute beachy towns. Big Sur is a national park a couple hours south of SF, and is gorgeous. It did have a wildfire a few years ago, so some areas are still recovering. A drive down Highway One (Pacific Coast Highway) is one of my favorite things ever.\n\nFor Boston, specifically baseball stuff, you will not be able to get a ticket to a game. October is the heart of playoff season, and many teams don’t even make it to the playoffs. I would suggest you look into tours of Fenway, which I believe they give on non-game days, but you’d need to check their website.

70,Flights cancelled with American Airlines - what can I do?,4,73bhlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/73bhlb/flights_cancelled_with_american_airlines_what_can/,20,1506755465.0,"Hi,

Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. If it isn't, let me know and I'll post somewhere else but would appreciate if anyone could point me in the direction of somewhere more appropriate.

I've got flights booked to New York (JFK) for a flight that departs in about ten hours from Manchester in the UK (flight AA 211) but, an hour ago, I received an email from the airline to say it's been cancelled. They have offered to put us on a different flight but none of them are suitable.

The airline is American Airlines. I've been on hold for an hour now and they've stopped responding to me on Twitter so am turning to Reddit to see what my options might be.

* In an idea scenario, they would offer to purchase our new flights with a different airline. I can see there are suitable alternative flights with a different airline.
* Next best scenario would be that they fully refund our flights so that we can put that money towards the flights with a different airline (which would end up costing us money since flights to NY at this point are obviously way more expensive than they were when we booked them).
* Worst scenario would be that they force us to fly AA and insist that we end up taking one of the alternative options they've presented us with (which would mean cutting our holiday short, sitting on a flight for 15 hours instead of 8 and have wasted money on hotel rooms that we won't be staying in).

Additional info: we booked through Expedia and the flights are actually listed as with British Airways but operated by American Airlines. Since the email came from AA and not BA, it's them I'm trying to speak to. Plus the BA helpline is closed and they don't have a 24 hour helpline which is ridiculous. We did not purchase travel insurance.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Can anyone advise what to do since AA are being absolutely useless?

Thanks.","[""> They have offered to put us on a different flight but none of them are suitable.\n\nIn what way are they not suitable?\n\nIn any event, what did they say when you asked for one of these alternate options?\n\nEdit: Also, you can call the US number for BA.

71,American Airlines,0,59tznh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/59tznh/american_airlines/,21,1477684477.0,"Sent this on 16 Oct. I following up a week later. AA chooses not to address this abysmal behavior by their employees.

Attendant refused to tell me her name (blonde, a bit weathered looking) after she said, ""What are you? A terrorist?"" for trying to use the 1st class lavatory (nearest my seat), which has NEVER been an issue in all of my years of flying. She pushed me back (yes, put her hands on me) and started berating me loudly. Not only am I not a terrorist, I'm a highly decorated 15-year Air Force veteran who's likely done and seen more than she ever has...things she's only seen in movies. She thought I'd be drinking--I was stone sober, so that was entertaining. It was her justification to defend her inappropriate behavior. I fell asleep and awoke 2 hours later. I walked to the back (where my subhuman types belong) to ask for a glass of wine. Again, she started screaming at me and told me I needed to get myself under control. I'd been doing crossword puzzles before I slept. Clearly, I was out of control. I was absolutely shocked! Then she clicked her pen open and started jabbing it at me within an inch of my body. I said, ""So, now you're physically threatening me, but I'm the terrorist, right?"" She said, ""You bet your ASS I'm pointing this at you!"" That was a blatant threat to me. She told me to go sit down before she called the Capt. ""You might end up in handcuffs, sweetie."" First of all, don't ever ""sweetie"" me. I'm a 40 year old woman and a client of AA. They are there to provide a service, not belittle customers. She told me, ""I'm in charge here, honey."" Secondly, I told her I wish she would call the Capt so I could have HER in cuffs when we landed for threatening me. Curious that I never saw her again until we were in the immigration line and she was STILL (12 hours later) glaring at me and rolling her eyes. A simple apology from AA is not going to do. I want nothing short of compensation/partial refund for my trip. I was on military leave from Korea. She ruined what had been an incredible trip home to family. She has thoroughly tarnished the reputation of AA.","[""I really think there's a lot more to this story that is being left out.\n\nAlso being a brand new account I estimate this is about 65% bullshit.\n\n>trying to use the 1st class lavatory (nearest my seat), which has NEVER been an issue in all of my years of flying\n\nRight there... that line screams bullshit.

Which I doubt."", 'The accounts that have ""real names"" as usernames never do.', ""No, that's why I said to move on and that no compensation was owed.

If it’s not rebookable you will have to buy a whole new ticket. (That’s also the reason why non rebookable tickets are cheaper then rebookable ones)\n\nIf a booking class is open / closed is based on availability of seats on a plane / the date of purchase and so on. And yes the closer you get to the day of departure the more expansive it will get normally based on the simple ( but true) reasoning that you will pay more if you need a ticket on short demand - tickets bought for 100€ 3-4 Months before can cost up too 500/800 € on the day of departure. \n\nBut these expansive tickets basically finance your 100€ seat filler ticket sold a few months before. \n\nIt all runs down again to “oh it was a mistake, can’t you rebook it free of charge (including fare difference / rebooking fees) - and there the answer is no - for the reasons I mentioned before.\n\nTo give you an other example : \n\nIf you buy a new TV for 1000€ and three months later you go the same shop and see it for 700€ cause new models came out and demand for the older model is lower you don’t expect the shop to give you the 300€.

Assuming there are a few of us from the rest of the world, I thought it might be helpful to gather some information that's applicable elsewhere. 

To start, here are some banking products I've used (UK based):

My new favourite is Revolut. It's prepaid and app-based account that doesn't charge currency conversion fees, instead using the interbank rate. You can also convert currency in your account, and store differemt currencies - for example, if I was going to Italy next month but the pound/euro rate was incredible today, I could 'lock in' that rate by converting £s in my account to €s.

I've mostly used the, to pay for extras like luggage. I'm sure this could be useful for people who wanted to play the credit card points game and fly regularly with those airlines.

The remaining value of the voucher is turned into another voucher that expires one year from the date of issue, so I would get to keep most of the value of my voucher.

80,Did American Airlines cheat me out of $60 and is their customer service department completely ineffective? Need some opinions here.,18,ol6o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ol6o2/did_american_airlines_cheat_me_out_of_60_and_is/,20,1326855934.0,"I've gone from being livid to very puzzled about this whole situation. Would be good to get some outside opinion.

I traveled on a flight from New York to Miami two months back. On showing up at curbside check-in, the baggage handler asked me for my ID and my credit card (note, he's only supposed to ask me for my ID for a domestic flight, as I told him I'd already checked in online. I confirmed this with a telephone rep).

I had two suitcases which would cost $60 to check. Unfortunately, one of them was overweight, and I said I'd switch some stuff around to even them out. It was 4 in the morning, and I looked tired, so the handler told me to just give him a tip and he'd overlook the extra weight.

At that point, I asked him how much it will be. He says $60, so I give him $70 cash and say that there's an extra $10 for tip. I ask him if that's fine and he says yes, gives me my baggage claim tags and wishes me a good flight.

I get home and I've been charged for $60 on my credit card in addition to the $70 cash I gave him.

Now of course, you can say that it's early in the morning, he might have made a mistake and thought the entire $70 cash was a tip. Or, worst case scenario he cheated me out of $60. After a phone call, two e-mails and a snail mail letter, American Airlines refuses to acknowledge either possibility, telling me that unless I have a receipt for both transactions, they can't do anything about it. 

They apologized for their employee asking for a tip, but that's it. Of course I want my money back, but moreover, I'd appreciate a little more concern on their part that one of their customers got taken for $60. Their responses thus far have been very unsatisfactory.

Am I being unreasonable here?","[""You never pay the baggage handler in cash, AA doesn't allow it. The dude ripped you off, but it's your word vs his. If you're paying him in cash why the fuck would you give him your CC as well?\n"", 'Did you dispute the charge with your credit card issuer?  Let them slug it out with the airline.', 'I\'m going to have to disagree with most of the posters here.\n\nAA didn\'t cheat you out of $60, the skycap cheated you out of $70. You owed AA $60 (assuming you would indeed have been able to redistribute the contents of your luggage in such a way as to avoid the overweight bag fee), and AA got $60 from you. It\'s not like AA is going to see any part of the cash the skycap accepted from you.\n\nThis guy solicited a bribe from you to cheat AA out of an overweight bag fee it was owed (at least technically, until you redistributed your bag contents), and then took a much larger bribe than you had agreed to give him. (Note: When you pay someone to commit a minor act of fraud, that\'s not a tip, it\'s a bribe.) \n\nStrictly speaking, *you still owe AA money*, i.e., the overweight bag fee the skycap didn\'t charge you (at least he held up that end of the bargain). You got cheated by this guy in the process of conspiring to cheat AA, and now you want AA, which has not even received all the money it was owed in the first place, to give you back what money it did receive. That\'s ridiculous. \n\nIn my book, if you break the rules and you get burned, well, that\'s part of the risk of breaking the rules. You can\'t have it both ways. You don\'t get to break the rules and then go crying to the people who made the rules for help when your having broken them results in something bad. This is like complaining that Adobe tech support isn\'t responsive enough when the pirated copy of Photoshop you bought doesn\'t work properly. You either complain to whomever sold you it, or you accept that you took a gamble and lost, and moved on. In your case you can\'t really track down the skycap and complain to him (well, maybe you could, but it doesn\'t seem worth the trouble), or you admit that you took a gamble by breaking the rules, and lost.\n\nOf course, as I said, I\'m assuming you\'re smart enough to have not told AA you were trying to break the rules (for if you did tell them that, it is hilarious that you would expect any kind of positive response), in which case the fact that you were cheating isn\'t a good reason for AA to not give you your money back, since AA doesn\'t know about it. But even assuming you only told AA, ""I paid a skycap $70 with the clearly acknowledged intent that $60 was for checked bag fees and $10 for a tip, but he charged my card $60 and kept the $70 for himself,"" you have no evidence that this actually took place. I can\'t really blame AA for not refunding you $60 based only on a story from you that has no supporting evidence. Yes, there are some companies who would just shrug and give you your $60 whether or not they believed you in order to boost their reputations for customer service, but those businesses are few and far between. Most will require some kind of evidence (think of returning an item to a store without a receipt or other evidence of the purchase). A response of, ""We\'re sorry this happened to you, but there\'s nothing we can do without evidence"" would be quite appropriate IMHO, and it seems that is what you got. \n\nI know this will not be popular, but I don\'t think you have anything to complain about, and actually have a lot of nerve to complain to AA when you are the one who was cheating them.', 'YSK: ""Skycaps"" at most airport curbside check-in counters are not airline employees at all, but independent contractors. You could thus also consider filing a complaint (against the airline and the airport that might be employing the Skycaps) with the FAA, NTSB, and DOT.\n\nHere is the link for one of these resources: \nhttp://airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/', ""It's obviously impossible for them to prove that you gave their employee money and they don't want to be cheated but there should be ways of trying to make this right with you.  Sadly it doesn't seem like American Airlines cares at all about their level of service or their customers.  Just keep fighting and trying to move up until someone will at least care about your problem and try to do something about it.  Or you could always just dispute the charge on your credit card and hopefully they will take care of it for you.\n\nMy recent interaction with them:\n\nI recently used their website to buy a ticket and on the last step an error popped up telling me the price went up by $200.  Obviously I felt cheated since I had already picked the flights and should have had at least a few minutes to finish my purchase at that price (even ticketmaster gives you that).  I spent over an hour on the phone where their employee was very rude and they did not care to even attempt to make it right with me.  I have still not heard back from my emails to customer relations (can't believe they don't have a phone number for complaints)."", "">Am I being unreasonable here?\n\nNo, American Airlines are complete and total fuckwads top to bottom.\n\nBut as far as your money? Might just be out sixty bucks this time, next time make sure everything's done officially, make sure you weigh your bags beforehand, and most of all, *don't fly AA*."", ""Look at it from his perspective as a thief! Imagine you work a low paying job as a Sky Cap in one of the world's busiest airports for a few years. $12 an hour maybe? Then, in the name of rising fuel prices the company you work for starts charging passengers additional fees to check luggage and paying you the same (regardless or not if its deserved or undeserved). Instead of $20 or $30 dollars cash passing through your hands over the course of an entire day, $700-$800 is. Game changer. Then you figure a way to skim off the top. Factor just a little bit into your paycheck and its substantial. I say he did it on purpose. "", ""The decline of their service standards in the last, I dunno, 4 to 5 years has been really noticeable. Complaints are ignored, and despite the fact that the company just filed for bankruptcy, they obviously flat out don't care about tending to customers' concerns. \n\nJust don't give these people your money. They're thieves. "", 'Indeed, some red flags there.', ""That's what's so frustrating about this. The very first thing he did was ask for my credit card and ID, and I figured it was just to verify that I was checked in. Had it not been that early in the morning, I might have thought twice about that.\n\nIn all their responses, they refuse to acknowledge that him asking for my credit card upfront was wrong on his part, despite the fact that one of their employees told me over the phone that he shouldn't have done that. Furthermore, I have a receipt for the credit card transaction, so they can track down the employee who took my bags, easily. They just don't give a shit.\n\nI had hoped by sending in a letter as my final resort I would have gotten a reply from someone else in customer service; instead, I received a response from the same douchebag who has been replying to my complaint emails through the website: some jerkoff named H M Alvarez. \n\nI just wanna set up a website where people can share their AA horror stories... I'm sure there are billions of them."", ""I would dispute the charge with my credit card company, but since I don't have a receipt for the cash transaction, I'm not sure it would end up in my favor."", ""I've never had any airline charge me an overweight bag fee when I've asked to take a moment to redistribute the weight in my bag.

Half the time, for one extra pound, they\'ll just overlook it without even asking for a tip.\n\nWhat do I expect? I expect a reasonable response from the company when I report the incident, one that takes into account and responds to the information I present them with, even if they explain why they can\'t refund me the money.

Me and her would really appreciate it if someone here could create a step-by-step guide on what she has to do.

Here is a bit of background information which should help:

- She is a US passport holder and has travel insurance for her trip.

- She is flying with Delta Airlines in her domestic flights but her flight to the UK is operated by Virgin Atlantic (We booked it all using delta.com though so it's a partnership thing I think).

- She is going from Charleston, WV to Atlanta, GA for a 2 hour layover. Then, she will be going onto London 
Heathrow afterwards.

- We plan to do the Online check in 24 hours before her flight departs so we can select her seats. 

I also have never flown on my own or been out of Europe so we would really appreciate some help, especially as a lot of you are frequent travellers.

We're coming up to the trip in May 2019. For my sanity, I just wanted to make sure our plan makes sense to more experienced travelers than us. 

We're flying into Edinburgh and out of London for 2 weeks. We won't be renting a car (we were too chicken this time) so we will be using trains and 1 small group tour to get around. We do have Airbnb's booked in each place. I tried keeping the itinerary open for the day to day stuff. We wanted flexibility. We do have notes on things we would like to see/do. Here is pretty much our final plan;

May 10 - Red eye from Pennsylvania to Edinburgh. Arriving the next morning.
 
May 11 to May 13 - Check in to Airbnb in New Town (Early check in already set up). Explore Edinburgh.

May 14  to May 16 - Check out in Edinburgh and begin 3 Day Rabbie's tour to Skye. Come back to Edinburgh the 16th and take train to York. (Established cushion time with Rabbies for the train). Check in to York Airbnb.

May 17 to May 18 - Explore York for 1 full day. Stay a second night then leave the next morning for London. Check into Southbank Airbnb (Early check in already set up). 

May 19 to May 23 - Explore London. Go to Warner Bros. Studio on the 19th and Hamilton the evening of the 22nd. Maybe a day trip to Windsor. 

May 24 - Fly home, 1030 AM flight back to Pennsylvania

We're getting a Two Together Railcard, using Giffgaff for our phones and doing Google Pay for the Tube. We have cards that have no foreign transaction fees.  We're also just bringing a carry on and small backpack each to make it easier to move around. I figured we can just check our carry in bags on the way home if we want to bring home anything special like alcohol.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!  :)","[""Please, please don't be one of those typical americans that wants to see 18 cities in 20 days. you'll miss out on everything, and it simply won't be nearly as worthwhile."", '[deleted]', 'for general infos about train travel in europe use this site.  \nwww.seat61.com  \n\nmost americans think they need a rail pass, but its almost always cheaper to buy point to point tickets.   \nhttp://www.seat61.com/Railpass-and-Eurail-pass-guide.htm#.VRqXk_msWYA', 'I like to use [this](http://www.hostelz.com/) for hostels to find the best price', ""> Flying out from Florida, which locations should I focus on and which airlines?\n\nSidebar: [Guide to airfare search engines](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/airfare)\n\nTry using Google Flights and entering whatever airports you want to see the cheapest.

As much as I'd like to relax in a couple towns, we're a bunch of history fanatics that'll never forgive ourselves for missing out on various sites and experiences.  If I get lucky enough to return someday, It'll be for 2-3 weeks in a single town  that's less of a popular global attraction."", 'Hostel bookers... *noted*', ""Interesting, I'll look at the pricing comparisons when I get around to mapping out the trip, thanks!"", ""Thanks!  I'll definitely check this out tonight."", ""Sorry, I should've been more specific.  We're planning on sleeping on the train overnight as much as possible to save time and money on hostels.  I'm wondering if 1st class is significantly better for overnights."", ""Thanks!  I'll keep them in mind while I'm running comparisons."", ""Well what any experienced traveler and myself would advise you is that the transit between cities (even close cities) easily eats up half your days. 10 in 30 days is probably going to be a much busier schedule than you anticipate. I'd highly recommend that you see if there's one or two places you could remove from the list (Europe isn't going anywhere). 1 day and change per city isn't hardly enough for most major (and minor, even) cities across that continent.\n\nIn response to ISIC- in my four years studying in Europe, I probably used mine once or twice. Most places have no clue what it is. I wouldn't bother. \n\n1st class isn't really a huge deal. Since you're a student, that money can be assigned to more important things (like beer). Sleeper cars and the like also arn't super necessary even on long train rides. Most trains are pretty smooth.\n\nIn terms of flying out of Florida, it really depends where in the state you are. Miami is obviously the main hub, and there's huge traffic between Miami and most Spanish airports. A flight between Miami and Madrid or Barcelona is going to put you in cheap and easy reach of much of Europe and be much, much less expensive than flying from Tallahassee to Dusseldorf or something silly like that. Really, taking an (Iberia or other direct airline) flight from Miami to Spain is probably the cheapest way to get to Europe from the U.S., period. (New York to Dublin probably holds the title, but only by about $30 less)\n\nBooking hostels in advance may shave some money off. What I would recommend is find the hostel through a website (hostelworld is pretty much a monolith when it comes to western europe) but then make your reservation through the individual hostel's website. You don't have to pay any type of booking fees, normally there's a cheaper deposit, and if you have any problems or issues with the hostel before your arrival, its normally a hell of a lot easier if there's not a third party in the mix. Also, don't underestimate how much fun being in a dorm with a bunch of people you don't know actually is. Its alot cheaper, and I have to say, its one of the best way to meet new people while traveling, and the stories you'll get from people will normally be amazing. One of the most important aspects of traveling is the people you meet along the way, I'd say.\n\nYou didn't mention if your $4,000 covers flights or not. I will mention this to you- anywhere in Europe jacks up their prices during the summer (some places much more than others). As you're probably already aware, traveling through Germany or Northen Europe is going to much, much more expensive than traveling through the south of europe (portugal and spain for instance). It should be enough, but you'll have to keep track of your spending habits. Another negative of you moving around so much is that you're going to be paying alot more in general expenses- bus and metro fees, ect. The general type of stuff you have to pay more for the first time but is cheaper thereafter adds up.\n\nBest of travels!\n\nEdit: Oh I nearly forgot! Most hostels fill up SUPER fast in the summer. Its really nice to be able to plan on the fly, but booking in advance is suggested for popular destinations"", '> never forgive ourselves for missing out on various sites and experiences\n\nSeeing almost nothing of 10 places is less of an experience than actually seeing and learning about 5 places.', ""$4000 including flight? You'll have to be pretty frugal if you're traveling that much in 30 days. \n\nAlso, it's great being a history fan and all, but please don't waste your time in lines. They'll be long and end up taking up half your trip. If you can take a virtual tour from home, don't bother wasting hours in a line. "", ""Also, don't forget to check out bus travel. I can take a 6.5 hour train ride from Berlin to Munich for 85 Euros, or a 7.5 hour bus for 22 Euros. Depending on how tight your budget gets the extra 1 hour of travel to save 60 Euros might be worth it. \n"", ""Wow, I freaking love you.  That response just took a huge weight off my shoulders.\n\nUnfortunately, the budget includes everything, and we'll be flying out from either Miami or Fort Lauderdale.  I hasn't fully considered the cost of public transportation.  I'll talk to my friends about weeding out some less essential locations.\n\nSeriously, thank you so much for the help!"", ""Certainly! Feel free to ask if you have any other questions. Since you mentioned Fort Lauderdale, you may want to look at Norwegian air's website. Its a budget airline (with all the good and bad that entails) that has a hub in FLL. I've talked to people who've gotten round trip tickets from florida to copenhagen and back using them for around $400-500 total. Not during the summer, but its worth looking at their fares. Ryanair is another option to consider, but that depends heavily on how much baggage you decide to bring. Cheap intercity flights/buses (buses are not sketchy at all like most of those found in the states) can take you anywhere. Not as comfortable as a train, but much cheaper and just as easy. Blablacar is another great option if you arn't traveling large distances, may want to look into that. All things considered, a eurorail pass makes travel simple (train station->train station), but you'll pay extra for that, and if one of your group loses their pass or gets it stolen during the trip then you're basically SOL (there's literally no incentive for someone to steal them, but it happens rarely). Sorry for rambling, I just keep recalling all the mistakes I learned from when I first went to Europe. You'll love the trip, I'm sure. "", ""Ramble all you want, it's a gold mine for me haha""]"

85,[22M] Impulsively booked flights to Mexico city and leaving in three days... What happens next?,3,2nw03t,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2nw03t/22m_impulsively_booked_flights_to_mexico_city_and/,20,1417420738.0,"Hey guys,

I've just started my uni holidays and after fantasizing about heading to mexico for years I finally booked flights! So far I am leaving in three days, I have done no real research and pretty open as to what happens next.

I have a return flight planned in late Feb so I will have almost three months to travel. Things I would like to do:

- Crash course in Spanish (basically just enough to get around initially, I'm not expecting to become fluent) 
   - Contemplating between a week long course in Oaxaca or Mex city
- Buy a surfboard (Airline won't allow me to take one)
   - Planning on doing this in Puerto Escondido
- Volunteer (I have construction and agricultural experience)
   - Would be nice finding something close to surf although I'm open
   - Also is it possible to find work that will cover Board/Food?
- Probably starting in mexico city I will head to Oaxaca and then on to Puerto Escondido by bus
- Sounds like central american countries would be cheaper, so I'd like to head south pretty soon after touching down.

Has anyone had experience surfing southern mexico/central america?

I have spent some time backpacking previously and I am reasonably comfortable with playing it by ear, but I thought the reddit community would be able to add to the experience :)

As I say, I have no real plans and open to all suggestions!
Where to next?","['I suggest you check out helpx.net and http://www.wwoofmexico.org/ when it comes to volunteering ', 'If you stay for a bit in Mexico city take a tour to see Teotihuacan. Its an amazing place to visit. Also you can get around anywhere riding the subway. Its around 30 cents American. The Zocalo is a cool place to shop. As far as surfing goes, we have surfed El Salvador(playa del Tunco) and Nicaragua(San Juan Del Sur) Both spots are pretty great. They are far from Mexico city. I would just rent a board. Its around 10 bucks a day. You then wount have to lug around a surfboard everywhere. Or try to sell it before you head back.', ""Like others have said, a Spanish course will be cheaper in Guatemala. And Guatemalans speak a very 'clean' version of Spanish with a very clear accent. I could always understand them the best. Even though I lived quite close to the Guatemalan border in Honduras, going there was like night and day in terms of how well I could understand people. Mexican Spanish has a ton of slang and going from one shitty Honduran accent to the Mexico City accent was challenging. Before you go, study your phrase book. I had enough Spanish to get by on without one at first, and built on it pretty continually. Now my Spanish is absolute shit but I can have decent conversations after close to a year. I didn't put a lot of effort towards learning Spanish though, I just picked it up casually. \n\nI found hotels and hostels to be much cheaper in Guatemala but food is definitely more expensive. Overall though, C. America is cheaper - I think Nicaragua is the cheapest but never went. I don't think Nicaraguans are overly fond of Americans. I hear really great things about surfing in El Salvador. \n\nBus rides can get very long in Mexico and Central America, so be prepared. Within Mexico, it's often the same price to fly as to take ADO - check out Interjet and Volaris flights first. I got a great deal going from Guatemala City to Mexico City on Interjet. Also do keep a close eye on all your valuables, it seems like almost everyone had something stolen. This is doubly true for time on the bus. \n\nDo spend some time in Mexico City though, it's a fantastic place. Overall I prefer Mexico to Central America - *much* better food (can't emphasize this enough) and friendlier people. "", ""I live just outside of Puerto Escondido but I have no idea where you could volunteer or work to cover food/board. I know that some of the surfers do carpentry work but it would be pretty tough to set up work on such short notice.\n\nThe main surfing season here is during the summer but you can still surf here year round. Unless you're a big wave surfer you'll probably spend most days at La Punta.\n\nUnless you're dead-set on having language class be part of your fun, you could probably skip the course...a friend of ours visited us from Australia and did courses and after 2 weeks he still could hardly say anything, ha.\n\nIt will definitely be cheaper in Central America, quite a bit cheaper...I was in Guatemala last summer and I loved it, but I didn't go to the beaches at all.\n\nSpanish courses are also 1/2 the cost in Guatemala just so you know."", 'Not getting kidnapped by the cartels would be nice ', ""I just returned from a 6 month surf trip through mexico and central america. We drove from San Francisco California all the way to Panama and back up. Teotihuacan is cool if you're into the sightseeing tourist stuff. The drive from Oaxaca to PE is rough. Head to Central America for a cheaper trip. Although Mexico had the best weed by far. Buses in Mexico are very expensive compared to Central where they are nearly free. I spoke almost no spanish before I started and just learned a little bit everyday by necessity. You'll be surprised how easy it is to get along without it. Don't pay to volunteer. Find a family or someone in need and give them a hand. Help build shit or do chores. People are very curious and kind toward travelers. If this is mainly a surf trip you will not be disappointed. The native women get prettier the farther south you go. El Salvador is incredibly cheap and has a ton of great waves. Bocas Del Toro, Panama and San Juan Del Sur are the best party/ surf areas.

However, my favorite fried chicken in Central America is definitely Pollo Pinulito! A Guatemalan friend of mine recommended them to me, and there was one in the border town nearby. They cut the breasts in a really cool way so you're not stuck with extra bone, and it was always moist. And the fries had a spicy coating on them.

We surfed in Nicaragua for a couple months. Up North is mostly shore break that we had little success with. Although I know they're are good spots up there. The offshore corridor is where it's at. The area west of Lake Nicaragua has off shore wind most of the year. We were based out of Playa Maderas. It was one of our favorite spots. It's 20 minutes down dirt roads from an incredible party town, San Juan Del Sur. All hostels run shuttles from SJDS to the beaches daily. We camped at Maderas and caught dawn patrol glass before the shuttles arrive at 9am. We took several striker missions North of there to Colorodos, Popoyo, Lances Left, etc. Incredible waves up there!\n      We heeded the advice of others to avoid taking our nice Suburban truck and Camper Trailer to remote beaches in Guatemala. The main road runs over an hour away from the beach so you'd have to take a 2 hour round trip to check a spot. Look at a map and you'll see what I mean. Don't get me wrong Guatemala is incredibly beautiful and we had an amazing time at Lake Atitlan. But we stuck to the beaten path for the most part.\n     El Salvador was the greatest unexpected pleasure of the trip. I knew nothing of the place before we went. At first we stayed in an incredible Hostel called Olas Permanentes (permanent waves) in El Zonte. It is literally on the beach. The waves crash into the side of the restaurant at high tide. We surfed naked on the break directly in front as well as the point a few hundred yards south. We then moved our trailer to a Mango Orchard in Sunzal. If you stay in Sunzal you have a short walk to the break. It's a really fun mellow long right point break, but if your an advanced surfer you may get bored quickly. Walk down the beach a little ways and you'll be at the party spot. Kind of the hub of the young hostel backpacker crowd. Check a map I forget the name.La Libertad is the main town a few miles farther south of that. The legendary Punta Roca is there. We never caught it on a good swell but when it fires...well look it up. More localism there. Southern El Salvador was incredible as well. A family let us camp on there land for a couple weeks near Punta Mango. We surfed it and another right point on that same dirt road. Mango gets blow out early and everyone knows it. Gangs of early birds flocked in on the boat ferries from the main town several miles away. You can take a bus from town to a sweet little hostel right at the point. \n     Bocas Del Toro, Panama was incredible. Look it up. Costa Rica has epic waves just a little pricier there.

Keep us posted with pics!\n"", ""But yes...overall I agree that the food is much better in Mexico.\n\nWhere we live, just outside of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, there are no American fast food restaurants, and so while I love the local feel here I have no shame in admitting that when I go on vacation I grub hard core on the foods I can't get here.....I probably ate half of my meals in Guatemala at Burger King, Pollo Campero and Wendy's, simply because these things aren't available here :)"", ""The flights into Mexico city were a few hundred dollars cheaper when I booked. You're right though, and I don't plan to spend that much time in Mexico.

I'm not really traveling far. I'm just going from California to New Hampshire and I'd like some advice.  
I've never traveled anywhere via plane, nor I have I gone on a trip alone. So, doing both the for the first time, at the same time, is a little more than intimidating.  
I have checked out the ITA matrix and I probably know where I'll be buying my ticket from there.  
I just saw that there is now a link to the beginners guide to airports, and I will be checking that soon. (It wasn't a link when I checked it a few weeks ago.)  
  
SO! My main question is:  
Are there any airlines I should avoid?  
I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?  
  
Any other tips that the beginners guide may not tell me?  
  
Any scams I should avoid? ie. ""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""  
  
I'll add more questions later, in the meantime any other advice you can give me from what I stated would be appreciated. If you have any questions for me I will answer them as soon as possible.  ","['You very likely can not take a bottle of water through security. You can however take an empty water bottle which you then refill once you are through security.\n\nIf possible travel with carry on luggage only. Check your airline\'s specific limitations. If you don\'t check a bag then you don\'t have to worry about it getting lost or damaged, you don\'t need to wait for your bag on arrival and you are much more likely to just get waved through security when you arrive (assuming there is security there, which there may not be as its a domestic flight).\n\nHave your ID accessible more or less the whole time. You will have to show it some number of times between one and infinity so don\'t show it once then put it away somewhere hard to get to.\n\nIt is better to get there early rather than late. By my thinking your holiday starts as soon as you arrive at the airport so arriving early is extra holiday time. Plus, once you are there you don\'t have to worry about being late.\n\n>I\'ll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don\'t have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?\n\nIs the multi-leg flight booked as the one transaction with one airline? If not they are very likely classed as separate flights so if the first leg gets delayed and you miss the second, that is just too bad. Either go non-stop or book a multi-leg flight in a single transaction.\n\n>""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""\n\nIt is expensive but its generally not bad. Mind you, I have never flown on an american airline and it mostly seems to be americans who complain loudly about it.', ""I'd go with JetBlue, they allow a free checked bag, and you'll get chips and a non-alcoholic beverage for free. There is also free DirectTV. All services that you'd have to pay for with a lot of other domestic airlines. The flight attendant was even so nice, that she said I looked thirsty, so she gave me the entire can of the beverage I asked for, where you usually only get a cup."", ""> I have checked out the ITA matrix and I probably know where I'll be buying my ticket from there.\n\nYou can't buy directly from ITA Matrix. Any prices you find on ITA though, you can almost certainly replicate on the official airline sites or other sites like Expedia or Orbitz.\n\n> Is there any airlines that I should avoid? \n\nProbably avoid Spirit airlines.\n\n> Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?\n\nNo. I've never had a problem with United with my luggage and I fly with them quite often. If you're worried, don't bring a guitar then. Their care is pretty much the same as any of the other big carrier's care. If it wasn't United last time, it'd've been Delta or AA. \n\n> My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) \n\nThey're all fine and pretty much the same. Someone once said that if you were blindfolded, ushered onto an airplane (and removed all logos and any hint of what airline you're taking), you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the big carriers: UA, DL, AA, US. \n\n> Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?\n\nIt doesn't matter much. If you decide for a connecting flight, just make sure you have enough time in between and you buy it on *one ticket*. Since you're flying domestic anyways, 1-1.5 hrs should be sufficient connection time. As long as it's all on one ticket and you've left reasonable connection time, then the airline is obligated to get you to your final destination.\n\n> Any scams I should avoid?\n\nSince you're flying domestic, you probably won't get a meal.

Air travel is surprisingly easy and abundantly safe.  Some thoughts in response to your questions:\n\n* All of the airline options you presented are essentially the same, assuming that you only have carry-on baggage.  If you have to check a bag, JetBlue and Southwest will let you check one bag for free.  The rest charge about $25 for a checked bag.  However, [this handy-dandy-website](http://www.airline-baggage-fees.com/) keeps track of all baggage fee policies in one place.\n\n* If you are bringing a guitar, United is now probably the best airline to fly because they are acutely aware of the care they use with guitars due to all the bad PR they got with that.  \n\n* Nonstop flights are always a plus.  You get to spend more time at your destination.  And you can budget more accurately as you will not have a bunch of ""incidentals"" that you hadn\'t budgeted for when you have a 3 hour stopover (i.e. drinks, snacks, a magazine, a book, a gadget).  The benefit to many connections is a circuitous route that will net you more frequent flyer miles.  \n\n* [Everything you wanted to know about airplane food](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grace-mcclure/everything-youve-wanted-t_b_4421803.html).\n\nGood luck and happy travels!', ""My only tip (for beginners and seasoned travellers) is just to get to the airport early. It will definitely make it less stressful and things will probably work out better. If you have time to spare you can read or browse the web or walk around or whatever, but you'll be happy. Following that, once you go through security go directly to your gate. Once you've found it you'll know where it is, if there are any changes etc. and you'll be able to explore the airport freely. \n\nFinally, if you have any, any questions while travelling just ask an employee or even a fellow traveller and you'll get good advice!"", ""Hi, airline employee here! The most important advice I can give is never never book through a third party site like cheap tickets, orbitz, travelocity etc. I have herd of and seen so many mistakes, such as booking a person on an itinerary that wont work, not putting seat requests in, or not giving the airline contact info leaving you totally out of the loop of flights are delayed, changed etc. Once you book a ticket through these websites, most times the airlines cant make changes, and you have to call the company that issued the ticket, even if you are standing in the airport, and pay any fees they might charge. These sites are okay to get a general idea of the ticket price, but always book directly with the airline you will be traveling on. \n\nAlso, always look at the total travel time. While you might think you are getting a good deal by saving 50.00, you might also be buying an itinerary that has a 4 hour layover in Cleveland. \n\nFinally, airlines handle millions of pieces of luggage a day, and 99.9 percent of it makes it to where its supposed to go. However you can do some things to make sure your bags have the best chance of making it. Make sure your bag has a sturdy name tag. The little paper and elastic ones the airlines give are okay, but can get ripped off easily. Check the airlines bag allowance, most major airlines change 25.00 for a bag, but some like JetBlue and Southwest let you check a bag for free. Weigh your bag before you get to the airport. Most airlines have a limit of 50lbs. If you can, try and book a trip with the least amount of stops. Every time you have to get of the plane and transfer to a different one is another chance for your bag to get lost. \n\nAs far as airline choices, since you're going to New Hampshire if you want to go non stop I guess you'll be going to Boston? So for non stop flights your choices are American, Virgin America, United and JetBlue. If all the prices were the same and I had my choice, I would probably pick JetBlue since they have the most legroom, an important factor for us tall folks, you get a free bag, and you can fly out of Long Beach or LAX.  \n\nBut thats just all my opinion.

87,Two separate flight bookings - what to do at airport where I change?,1,c4irq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/c4irq8/two_separate_flight_bookings_what_to_do_at/,20,1561383029.0,"It was cheaper for me to purchase separate flights: one from A to X and then a second from X to B (instead of A to B through one airline/booking service).

So what do I do at airport X? I imagine that I get my bag from baggage and then check it in with the airline that takes me to B (and heaven help me if it gets lost on the way to X). 

But is there anything I need to be aware of? Is there a better way to do this?

We are planning on having 2 weeks, including travel days to explore. 

 We are outdoorsy (hiking, rock climbing, wilderness backpacking, SUP, kayaking) and really want that to be a big part of what we do. We are also big foodies and love good wine, beers, meads, spirits.. etc. Air bnbs are more our style than hotels. Tents ok too but would have to consider taking that stuff on airlines.

91,Guys’ trip this winter to the southwest United States. Three architects. Looking for a unique city with an offbeat spirit and a real sense of place. What do you recommend?,5,6wk53z,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6wk53z/guys_trip_this_winter_to_the_southwest_united/,19,1503963294.0,"**The brief:**   The three of us were college buddies and roommates in the late 1990’s;  twenty-odd years later, we are all ~40-year-old practicing architects and have remained really good friends.  We get together with our families every summer, but once a year feels like too long an interval.  So we’re starting a tradition of an annual guys’ reunion weekend.  We’re using it as an opportunity to not only catch up and recapitulate inside jokes, but also discover new places.  We live in various cities on the East Coast U.S. and like the idea of escaping the winter to someplace warmer.


**What we’re looking for:**  a fun, interesting city in the southwest U.S.   So much of the American landscape has become homogenized, so we would gravitate toward places that feel unique, singular, authentic.   We also don’t take ourselves too seriously, so quirky, unusual, strange, goofy are OK too.  


**Interests:**  Diverse and varied.  In order of significance:  Architecture (both historic and modern), cityscapes, regional food, beer/booze, art, music (a mix of indie/alternative and vintage 1970's-1990's rock), vintage vinyl, vintage cars, books, movies, stand-up comedy, industrial landscapes, gardening, etc.....  I personally like hiking and the outdoors but I don’t know that we'd structure a full day around a hike.  However if there are must-see landscapes outside the city we would definitely consider a side trip.  

Oh, and when we get together we tend to drink.  A lot.  


**Timeframe:**  Most likely January or February.


**Trip duration:**  Probably a long weekend, so fly in on a Weds or Thurs night and fly out Sunday afternoon.  We would be flying out from the East Coast so direct flights are a plus; airports served by Southwest Airlines even more so.


**Budget:**  We’re working professionals, but we all have families and young children so budget is a consideration.  It’s hard to put a number to it, but if possible it would be nice to keep it in the hundreds, not thousands.  We like good food but are ok with cheap and cheerful.  A cool hotel would be nice but we don’t want to break the bank, and we will probably share a suite or pair of doubles. We would definitely consider renting a car if it’s necessary or worth the expense.  


**Cities under consideration:**  Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, Dallas, El Paso, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, etc.


**Cities not under consideration:**  Las Vegas.  It’s a fascinating place, and definitely checks a lot of boxes (unique, singular, quirky, strange, etc.) but the majority of us have already been there.


Thanks in advance for your input!
","[""Albuquerque and Santa Fe would be my suggestion for what you're looking at. Albuquerque is probably the cheapest option you've listed as well. There are tons of craft breweries and wineries and distilleries here. The food is unique, delicious, and interesting, it ain't Tex-Mex. You can get your fix of unique architecture in Santa Fe which is an hour drive away or take the train. There are some really interesting museums and art galleries. Pretty good music scene, especially now with Meow Wolf bringing in some more indie acts. You can more than get your outdoor fix with all of the mountains surrounding the area. "", 'I lived in Tucson for 25 years and spent a ton of time in Phoenix. There\'s nothing ""quirky"" about it-unless freeways and strip malls are considered quirky. Seriously, Tucson has everything you mentioned and more. Authentic Mexican and Native American culture can be found around every corner. The city is surrounded by four mountain ranges, the biggest being the Santa Catalinas which approach 10,000 feet in elevation. The Arizona Sonoran Desert Museum is a world famous zoo/biology center that only features flora and fauna from the Sonoran Desert. FYI- this desert reaches as far south as the southern jungles of Mexico, so not only will you see rattlers and Javelina, but also jaguars, wolves and so much more. Authentic Mexican food that will blow your mind and incredible hiking everywhere. Sabino Canyon has a tram to take you a couple of miles up the canyon to see the desert up close and personal, plus it has a creek with swimming holes along the entire way. Probably be too chilly to swim in the winter though. An easy 1 hour drive to the border town of Nogales, which has an American side and a Mexican side. Walk across the border to get great food and do some awesome shopping. Lots of clubs and bars with live music, and lots of Spanish Colonial architecture. San Xavier Del Bac is a gorgeous mission on the reservation southwest of town and Gates pass for the best sunset views anywhere in the U.S. that isn\'t on a beach.\n\nTrust me. Avoid Phoenix. Scottsdale too. Way to homogeneous. ', ""Not mentioned but Palm Springs is a nice but small boutique town with great mid century architecture.  Around Jan/Feb they host an annual Modernism week with lectures, tours, and convention shows revolving around the design theme.  There are a small amount of quaint but quality bars & restaurants, beautiful scenic landscapes and pools all make it a great weekend getaway.  It has an international airport as well.\n\nAfter that I'd say Austin or Santa Fe for fun & culture easily accessible. "", 'You could visit Taos Pueblo and Santa Fe. ', ""Really can't go wrong with Austin, Scottsdale, Santa Fe or Sedona if you want a true Southwest feel. Austin and Scottsdale would probably be best for a guys trip with drinking involved. Otherwise for City scapes LA and San Diego would be good options.\n\nAustin seems to hit most of the items."", 'Well, an obvious choice would be Phoenix/Tucson with a day trip to Taliesin West in Scottsdale. Southwest flies to Phoenix.\n\nI was there quite some time ago, so I doubt any specific recommendations of mine would be worthwhile. I recall Flagstaff being a quaint historic town, as well.', 'Phoenix is a good option.  Have Frank Lloyd Wright house and the best car show in the world in February.', ""Thanks for the input.  Hadn't heard of Meow Wolf but it looks pretty cool.  \n\nWhat do you like for local beer and hooch?  Any museum/gallery you would rate as must-see?"", ""Thanks.  Tucson sounds promising.  What's the best place to get this mind-blowing Mexican food?"", ""Thanks again for your response.  We decided to go with Tucson and your comments were definitely influential.  We're flying out there this Thursday for a long weekend.  Here's our thumbnail itinerary: \n\n-Hiking @ Sabino Canyon\n\n-Titan Missile Museum\n\n-Biosphere 2\n\n-Pima Air & Space Museum, time permitting\n\n-Stargazing at Kitt Peak observatory, and/or Gates Pass\n\n-Mexican food\n\n-Alcohol\n\nAny other recommendations?  Any unique or can't-miss bars?  \n"", 'Interesting idea, thanks.', ""Speaking of Flagstaff, if you head north to there I'd definitely recommend doing a side trip to Sedona, AZ and to see Slide Rock State Park. And of course, also see the Grand Canyon as well."", '[deleted]', ""In Santa Fe Meow Wolf is an absolute must see (full disclosure I work there actually but I was a fan and then an employee lol) It's this crazy 22,000 sqft interactive, multisensory, exploratory art installation that has a very in-depth mystery along side it. It's very unique. We often get compared to the City Museum in St Louis but it's definitely it's own thing. But there's also the more traditional art museums like the Georgia O'Keefe, International Folk Art Museum, and Museum of Spanish Colonial Art. In Albuquerque there is the the Indian Cultural Center and the National Museum of Nuclear History. There are a lot of cool historical points everywhere like the oldest house in the U.S. Is in Santa Fe, pueblos and pueblos ruin archeological sites, El Camino Royal-oldest trade route. \n\nFor local beer...That's tough. There is so much good beer. I'm a big fan of Bosque Brewery and La Cumbre. My favorite local winery is St Clair's. And for booze Left Turn.

The Shelter is fun too. It’s wall to wall JFK paraphernalia. It’s been a while since I spent any time there, so I’m sure there some new places. Your itinerary looks great! Glad I could help. Enjoy your time there. If you are going to Gates Pass, make a day of it and go to the Arizona Sonoran Desert Museum. It’s world famous, and probably not what you are expecting.\n\nhttps://www.desertmuseum.org/', 'Is Flagstaff/Sedona something that could be done in a day from Phoenix?', 'Barret Jackson', 'Awesome, thanks!', ""Yes, you could definitely do that very easily in a day's drive from Phoenix. Sedona(thanks Google Maps) is only 2 hours and 15 minutes from Phoenix, and Flagstaff 21/2 hours. South Rim of the Grand Canyon is 3 hours and 45 minutes, so theoretically if you were ambitious, you could hit all those places in one day and get back to Phoenix.\n\nGood luck, with whatever you decide to do for a day trip!""]"
92,Possible Mistake Fare booked - tips on getting airline to honor fare?,1,c7uyht,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/c7uyht/possible_mistake_fare_booked_tips_on_getting/,19,1562026958.0,"Good morning, I am looking to see if any of you have tips on how to proceed in my situation.

Last Tuesday I booked 2 round trip tix via Expedia on American Airlines/Iberian to Paris for $327 a piece. Obviously a great deal. Within an hour American changed one leg of the return flight by 1 hour and raised prices back up to market rates ($1040). American has not issued tickets, nor have they or Expedia cancelled the flight.

I have been on the phone with Expedia 3 times totaling 4 hours of talk time where they have tried to get me to reconfirm the flights at the changed fare, I have not reached out to American yet. Expedia claims they can do this due to a schedule change, however a 3rd level manager confirmed to me that this was because there was a mistake by American in reporting fares to Expedia for sale and they changed the prices before issuing my tix. 

First, have any of you been in a similar situation and gotten the airline/agent to honor the fare? 

If not, do any of you more experienced travelers have any tips on getting some traction on the fare being honored?

Thanks in advance for your help!","[""You can't force them to honor it. Your best bet is usually to just keep quiet and hope you don't get refunded. They don't have to honor the fare, but they can't just force you to pay more. One of three things has to happen:\n\n1. They honor the ticket.\n2. They refund you.\n3. You agree to pay the higher rate.\n\nIn my limited experience, they usually just honor it, but I've been refunded before. I was always refunded quickly, probably within the first week."", '$327 is within the realms of a reasonable transatlantic fare on a low cost carrier, so it\'s entirely feasible that AA/Iberia just had a flash sale to compete. \n\nIf you have a ""basic"" fare with no checked luggage and no free seat selection, there\'s a reasonable chance that it\'s a genuine fare.\n\nI\'d also enter your airline booking reference on Manage My Booking at aa.com and iberia.com and see if it appears there.', ""all airlines have in their terms and conditions that they don't have to honour mistake fares.  there is nothing you can do."", 'This is the reason I always book with the airline directly.', 'Has your credit card been charged?  It is strange you haven’t been issued a ticket.  I had that happen once on United and when I checked they had never charged my card and cancelled the reservation without any notice to me at all.', 'Where are you flying from? They are doing a ton of deals right now in the low $300s to Paris and Madrid from places like New York and Philadelphia (I think those ones might be Basic Econ though, that I have seen)', 'Thanks for the response! In the times that you were refunded, were you refunded with or without notice?', 'It does appear using the reference number. I was also able to add all of our passport info. The fares do appear to be ""basic"" fare class as you mentioned. Its just weird that AA has yet to issue tickets 6 days later.', 'This is certainly turning out to be quite a learning experience', ""I hadn't noticed before but all they did was put a hold on my card and did not actually charge it."", 'My closest main airport is SLC unfortunately', ""I don't remember exactly what it looked like, but I'm sure I got an email or something letting me know. \n\nIf you've got a confirmation number and it's been more than 2-3 days, you're probably in good shape. I've never heard of them taking longer than that to refund. I noticed you mentioned them not 'issuing tickets' yet, but I'm not sure what you mean by that. Did you not get a confirmation number when you booked?"", 'Essentially what I was issued was a confirmation number which pulls up my record on [AA.com](https://AA.com), but apparently it is a PNR and not an actual ticket. Based on my limited understanding, the PNR is essentially a hold on a flight but not an actual ticket.', ""I'm not an expert on the esoteric internals of flight booking systems. (Somewhat ironically, considering I'm a software developer that is actively working on one for a major carrier...)\n\nThat said, what you're describing seems normal to me. It's the same as what I've always experienced with AA. Your PNR/confirmation number is always the main thing that is used to locate and manage your reservation. (Apologies if you're already familiar with all this.) \n\nThe PNR is something you'll have in *addition* to your ticket number. It's not an *alternative* to it. The PNR refers to the whole reservation, whereas a ticket number is your specific seat on a specific flight. For example, if you booked a trip with your partner with a couple of layovers, your PNR would retrieve all the tickets for all the flights. In addition to that PNR, you'd have half a dozen or so ticket numbers for all the segments you two will be flying. Generally, ticket numbers aren't displayed as prominently on the website, app, etc as you very rarely actually need them. In practice, your PNR/confirmation code is all you ever need. \n\nLong story short, you've paid for your ticket, you've got a confirmation number, you should be in good shape. If the airline doesn't want to honor your reservation, they need to actually cancel it. Note too, if they cancel you they are also required to cover any non-refundable reservations you made based on this ticket purchase. i.e., They have to pay for your hotel and such. (This could probably work as leverage to get them to honor the ticket, but I've never actually been in that situation.) I don't think there are rules forcing them to cancel within any specific window, but it's obviously in their interest to not wait till the last minute. I've never had it take more than \\~48 hours for them to contact me about the refund.\n\nThese types of flash sales and mistake fares aren't terribly uncommon, and the prices you're seeing aren't unheard of. There are services that actively look for them and alert users. Many people, myself included, book them without issue. Often enough, our vacation plans are determined by some mistake fare we snagged."", ""Thanks for your help! I honestly think the problem lies with Expedia and not AA. After reading your comment and thinking through the process, I think that Expedia is hedging because they made the mistake and NOT AA and are hoping I will just cancel, which I won't. I think if AA or Expedia could have unilaterally cancelled my flight, they would have by now, but there must be something in the TOS keeping Expedia from doing so, especially since my PNR number is still live at AA and still pulls up my reservation.\n\nNow I just have to decide if I want to let Expedia sweat it out or reach out myself and keep escalating."", ""Also, weirdly enough, I checked AA and Iberia this morning and both of my tickets are still showing up AND there is a cost summary now on AA's website showing the fare I booked. I wonder if this means AA is acknowledging the fare? Maybe I'll just contact AA directly and pay for my fare then get Expedia to refund me."", ""I really think you might be overthinking this a bit. These processes are almost totally automated. Expedia and AA aren't negotiating in the background and I doubt anyone is personally involved in 'acknowledging' your booking. Did you not already pay the fare when you booked through Expedia? (If I'm not mistaken, Expedia requires full payment when you make a booking, right?)\n\nUnless I'm missing something in my read of things, it sounds like you booked through Expedia, the airline received your reservation normally and everything is ok. I don't think there is any action you need to be taking at this point other than deciding what you want to do in Paris. \n\nFor what it's worth, if you booked through Expedia, AA isn't going to let you pay directly. Likewise, Expedia would be unlikely to refund you if you did manage to submit a new payment to AA directly. Expedia made a deal with you to provide tickets at price XYZ. They held up their end of the deal and will want that money regardless of who else you may or may not have also paid. \n\nIf I were you, I'd be very inclined to leave this alone lest I provoke someone into canceling the fare and end up forced to rebook at the higher rate. As long as they haven't canceled your ticket, you don't really have anything to gain by contacting them farther."", 'Thanks for such a comprehensive reply, this is very helpful.\n\nAs for negotiating, this is just what I was told by the first 3 Expedia reps who told me they would need to call AA to get them to ""confirm"" the tix.\n\nAs an update as to the status, Expedia ended up cancelling my reservation without informing me. I got on the phone a 5th time and after an hour and 20 minutes finally made it to someone at corporate who acknowledged that Expedia made a mistake on their end and never actually sent the reservation through, then instead of trying to rectify the mistake cancelled the flights. Corporate apologized saying it was a system issue and did end up making me whole, and I have 2 confirmed tickets purchased at the same original fare to Paris! \n\nI think I simply got lucky with my persistence, as otherwise they would have just called it a mulligan and refunded my money, no harm no foul.\n\nRegardless, your advice was spot on, so thank you for your help.\n\nAny must see things in Paris besides the main attractions?', ""Glad to hear it worked out well for you!\n\nUnfortunately, I can't give you any recs as I've never been to Paris. Europe, in general, has never been a big interest to me. I'm sure I'll get there eventually. But for now, I'm still exploring the rest of the world.""]"
93,18 Day Trip to Anywhere,6,832ay4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/832ay4/18_day_trip_to_anywhere/,19,1520582275.0,"Hi guys! I’m about to use my vacation time, I’ll have a total of 18 days to travel and I’m trying to decide where to go. 

I’m thinking I’ll be gone from March 29th through April 15th, ish. I work for a major airline and can fly for free to pretty much anywhere. 

I’ll be moving a few weeks after this trip, so I’d like to keep the budget as low as possible. Hostels, cheap street food, etc. 

I want to be able to visit many destinations within a pretty close area, so I’m thinking maybe Western Europe or Thailand/Vietnam/surrounding countries and islands. 

I recently came back from a London/Stockholm trip, and I used to live in France, so I’m really leaning more towards Asia. However, I’ve never been to that part of the world and travelling there is intimidating to me. 

I’m under the impression that Thailand is very cheap for Americans to travel to. However, is it safe? I’m a 20 year old female and I’d be by myself the whole time. I travel quite a bit and I consider myself to be a safe and aware traveler. However, I do a lot of research before I visit a new place since I know that some places are just unsafe, as unfortunate as it may be.

How is the transport between countries? Myanmar to Thailand to Vietnam to the Philippines? Would I be able to get around okay without speaking any of the local languages?

I guess I’m just looking for some reassurance, or any suggestions for places to go on this big trip! Really, any advice would be appreciated ","['Hi! Travelling for 2 months around Asia now. \nThailand would be perfect for you probably. Krabi is amazing and you can also go to Bangkok and Chiang Mai and even maybe Cambodia or Laos (Luang Prabang is a lovely small city) in these 18 days. \nGo for it, it is safe and very cheap! ', 'South America could be a really good option! Mexico and specifically Mexico City, Tulum and Cancun are all really friendly and a really great place of the world to see. \n\nThe Colombia ""tour"" is also great! You can fly in and out of Bogota or Medellin and try and visit Salento, Cali, Cartagena and Jardin. Buses are easy and pretty cheap in Colombia. They are pretty bumpy though as they often go through the mountains to get from city to city.\n\nSE Asia would also be a great place to go. Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, etc... like you mentioned.\n\nMost places that you can easily travel to and have a lot of hostel options are generally safe. Although, it\'s good to be cautious and be aware of your surroundings! Stay in hostels and find friends to hangout with is something that I\'ve seen successful for new(ish) travelers. ', 'I know this isn’t on your list of places, but consider Argentina. It’s a beautiful country and will be great fall weather at that time. When I visited from theUS the most expensive part of the trip was the flights, but besides that, most everything was very affordable, so it could work for you! You could also visit Chile and Uruguay if you wanted to see other countries, but 18 days is great to see some of the best parts of Argentina.', ""Thailand isn't as cheap as you might be thinking.\n\nIt is quite safe if you have your wits about you.  Obviously doing things like walking alone at night in certain neighborhoods or going out drinking by yourself will be risks.  But those are also risks nearly anywhere.\n\nYou can get around SE Asia just fine without knowing any of the local languages.  Transport is not a problem.\n\nHonestly, SE Asia would be a great destination for a traveler looking for something new.  The only other thing I would suggest is Peru.  With 18 days you could hit several cities, see mountains, jungle, high plains, beaches, and even do the Inca trail if you are so inclined (although your dates might be a little early for good weather).  Or even if you don't do the Inca Trail, you could do any one of a number of other fantastic treks."", ""Southeast Asia is full of young backpackers.  If you stick to the tourist trail language won't be a problem.\n\nAlso look at Indonesia/Bali.\n\n"", 'Piggy backing on this - I have a very similar query: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/833rks/last_minute_12_week_getaway_budget_2000_including/', ""Highly recommend SEA since you don't have to pay for flight from the US. If you do the right amount of research, you'll find cheap hostels in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos.

Not difficult at all, comfortable and Low-cost buses available within each country, and cross-country as well. Also, the Budget airlines are much cheaper than the domestic flights in the US.

94,Frequent Travelers: What are your credit cards for miles and using internationally?,8,1v1am8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1v1am8/frequent_travelers_what_are_your_credit_cards_for/,19,1389572479.0,"In researching past top posts on /r/travel and current card options, many companies have changed their products within the last year. I'm refreshing the topic for new opinions and recommendations while providing a summary of 3 best options I found based on points/miles and travel perks vs cost of the card. 

**Assumptions:** /r/travel is on a tight budget,  will pay the monthly bill, use the card for day to day transactions while traveling, wants flexibility in getting and using miles or points, may use the credit card for supplemental insurance or emergency assistance.

**Credit Cards for Points and Traveling**
 
* [*Chase Sapphire Preferred*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=chase+sapphire+prefered)  - 1:1 points transfer to participating frequent flyer programs. 40,000 points if you spend $3,000 in the first 3 months. Double points on travel and dining, an additional point per dollar for hotels and airline bookings through their Ultimate Rewards Program. 5,000 points for an additional user. NO travel insurance/assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 annual fee, waived for the first year. 15.99% APR, 0% first year.

* [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) - 40,000 bonus miles if you spend $1,000 in the first 90 days. Double miles on all purchases. $200,000 travel accident insurance. Trip cancellation/interruption coverage. Emergency Assistance.

     No foreign Transaction fees. $89 Annual fee, waived the first year. 14.99% or 18.99% based on credit, 0% for first year.

* [*United/Chase MileagePlus Explorer*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Chase+MileagePlus+Explorer) - 30,000 miles if you spend $1,000 on the first 3 months. 5,000 miles for an additional user. Double miles on United flights.  10,000 miles per calender year if you spend more than $25,000.  NO Travel insurance or assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 transaction fee, waived first year. 15.24% APR, NOT waived for first year.

**Other card considerations:** Other carrier specific cards (ie [Citi AAdvantage](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Citi+AAdvantage), [American Express/Delta SkyMiles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Delta+SkyMiles)) do not offer as much flexibility as other cards and have been disregarded. [American Express Platinum](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=American+Express+Platinum) has reduced their benefits and rewards over the last year without reducing the $450 annual fee. 

**tl;dr** I researched credit cards to be used for travel and found the [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) to be the best current option. What have been your experiences and what are your recommendations?

The Capital one cards were great initially but other providers have started to catch up.  Chase has been doing a decent job rolling out quality travel friendly cards. But, if you're doing enough travel the AMEX is usually one of the go-to cards.\n\nThe Sapphire card, and the Chase British Airways card are both solid. It depends on what rewards structure you want. \n\nThe advantage of fee cards like the sapphire, is that they are often Visa Signature cards, which opens up a large assortment of added benefits such as extended warranties, travel insurance, car rental insurance, etc.\n\nAnother fact to keep in mind though is that a lot of American credit card companies are way behind on adopting the chip and pin structure.  Again, you can get it if you request it from some (eg Chase Sapphire) but with a lot of others it isn't available which makes the card effectively useless half the time in large parts of Europe.\n\nI'd be hesitant to get the United card, or a Delta Card as United and Delta just royally screwed all of their FFs recently when the devalued their rewards charts in November: http://www.nbcnews.com/travel/eye-popping-frequent-flier-program-changes-concern-travelers-2D11603301.

I love Scotland. \n\nTrue on the 60k which is great, but you also probably paid what - $600 in taxes? A lot of times you get more value using a multi-leg ticket for a route like that then using airmiles. Though, of course, it depends on the airports you're flying through, how they're handling taxes, etc. and also what regional benefits are attached to the card. \n\nEg; I use a BA card, and while booking an economy ticket back stateside with it is a bit of a tossup value/tradeoff wise because of taxes and other nonsense, I can use it for Flex tickets without taxes within Europe and snagged a RT flight from Copenhagen to Edinburgh through London during beak time this past summer for $55 return and 9k miles. \n\nJust depends on how quickly you can accumulate the miles and the value that results."", ""Taxes were just under 180, I think LHR has high taxes.

In about 2 weeks I'll be flying from my hometown (Amsterdam) to Toronto. I'm flying American Airlines and I have a 2 hour lay-over in Philadelphia. I have traveled extensively, and usually 2 hours are enough for layovers. However, I was just told today that I will apparently have to go through immigration in the U.S. and re-check my bags? Even though I won't leave the airside of the airport? Is there anyone that has any experience with this? Queuing up for immigration, re-checking my bag and then taking into account slight delays sounds like it'll be nearly impossible to be on time for my connecting flight.

New to reddit so I’m sorry if I’m doing this wrong! From the US, traveling to Thailand. I was wondering.. is there a major difference in Economy between say.. Air China vs. Qatar or Cathay? This is my first long haul flight, and my first flight that’s not on an American airline. I understand that Air China has some poor reviews while Qatar is the opposite. But I wasn’t sure if it’s basically all the same in economy? I’m booking today, the price difference is a couple hundred which is totally fine with me if I’m paying to be more comfortable / have a more pleasant flight! I’m actually quite nervous! I also don’t know what is a bad layover location when it comes to choosing a flight , or if that even matters!","[""The difference is certainly noticeable. Cathay and Qatar are, without question, better than Air China. And Doha and Hong Kong are both great airports; can't recommended Beijing or Shanghai so highly.\n\nWhether it is worth it is going to depend on your budget and how you value money. Personally for the long haul flight and given how you describe a couple hundred dollars, I'd spring for Qatar or Cathay Pacific."", 'Go for Qatar, or any middle eastern airliner whenever there’s a chance. IMO, Qatar, Etihaad, Turkish always better choices as far as the travel experience is concerned,', 'There are major differences, yes.\n\nIt\'s most noticeable between ""discount"" airlines like Spirit/Frontier/RyanAir/whatnot and mainline ones.\n\n* Mainline carriers charge fewer extraneous fees. For example, Air New Zealand and United Airlines still give away free beer and wine on international flights, while Spirit Airlines literally charges $10 to print your ticket. Some budget airlines charge even for carry-on bags, too.\n* Seat comfort has gotten worse pretty much across the board, but it\'s still better in some airlines. This depends also on the specific variant of plan. [Check SeatGuru](https://www.seatguru.com/) to see who has the best seats, which you should compare flight vs flight. (Qatar has surprisingly tiny seats in economy, actually!)\n* Customer service varies a lot. From the size of the queue to checkin, to how often they overbook flights, to how often flights are delayed. This is where those ratings come in.\n* Food, onboard service, all that -- it also varies, just like restaurants and hotels vary in quality.\n* Also, Air China probably isn\'t the safest. For best results on that, stick with Qatar.\n\nOverall I\'d probably go with Cathay Pacific, or if you don\'t care about a decently sized seat, Qatar. Air China probably has decently sized seats because it\'s a flag carrier in the developing world (weird how that works), but they have an atrocious reputation with flyers.', 'Strong preference for Cathay.

The A380 experience has been excellent, the India leg was slightly better than my United experience. I flew Air China domestically (in China) and I'd say it's maybe similar to United except with better food. In fact - starvation is favorable to United's economy food. Reason I chose BA to India was because return flights through the middle east don't allow you to have a laptop in your carry on (this was a work trip, I am not putting my work laptop in checked bag) - so that's something to keep in mind about middle eastern airlines. Also read reviews that while the US - Qatar leg would be nice, the Qatar - India leg would be absolute trash -- think I am sensing a pattern here about flights to India.

How the airline industry works.,8,730arx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/730arx/travel_hints_tips_how_the_airline_industry_works/,16,1506636442.0,"**Before you read the post, keep in mind that may not be relevant for someone who travels a few times during the year domestically within the United States to see family or for work. On the other hand the article was based and targeting international travelers. This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing.**


Back in the 80s and 90s shopping for air tickets was so much simpler. The airlines used to offer 3 fares. One for economy, one for business and one for first (for the airlines that offered it.) Everyone traveling economy for example would pay the same. (so no one was upset for paying more than the person next to them or some cousin who was bragging that paid less…) The reason about this was that when the tickets were “paper” and were physical items most agencies would pre-purchase and then set a price of how much they wanted to sell for the traveling season. (which also leaded to black market too in some cases. Having strong ethnic agencies that used to monopolize their markets, buying huge amounts of ticket stock and selling it to higher prices with huge margin of profit since they could do that. They could buy lots of ticket stock, make reservations and be able to hold them for weeks (can’t do this now), or book fake names to hold the space in flights and then change the name to whoever was traveling since there was so easy and without fees to change the names of the travelers.


What changed?


The airlines hated the fact of scheduling flights that could cost thousands of dollars without knowing if the flights will be full and sometimes sending half empty planes. They removed the paper tickets and changed the game. They introduced the “classes of service”! If let’s say on a flight there are 300 seats, and the cabins are broken down to 30 business class tickets, 70 premium economy and 200 economy tickets, each cabin is broken down to classes of service. Economy for example, those 200 seats are divided to a dozen of different economy fares that change every 9 tickets are sold. Example 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F 9G. The first 9 people will call they will buy at the price of the A class that may be $800, next 9 travelers will pay the higher tier economy, B which may be $900 etc. The highest economy may be at $1800-2000 and this is the same cabin and the same seats that someone paid probably $800 or less. The way this system works, benefits the airlines since the travelers must rush and try to buy way ahead of time to make sure they ll get the lowest economy class of service or else they will end up paying way more. The travelers cant wait till last moment anymore when there was only one economy fare out there. So it is a game between all of us the travelers. Whoever calls first and the earliest gets the good fares. On top of that, when you make get a reservation now days, you cant hold it for more than 1-2 days. (before the agents could hold them for weeks). Not to mention the penalties. Most tickets are non refundable (with an exception of death). All tickets have penalties when you try to change them and the list going on. Keep in mind in domestic and international tickets, the lowest ones (lowest classes of service) come with some harsh rules behind them. Such as you don’t get miles or you can accumulate a very low amount of them. You are not allowed to travel with a luggage (unless you pay extra at the airport). Usually those tickets are non refundable and non changeable. (If you must change something, then you lose the ticket and you have to buy new one). Not to mention you can pre-select your seating assignment. 


When buying tickets be very careful. For domestic traveling always go directly to the airlines. They keep that portion of market for themselves. Which means, you aren’t going to get a better deal anywhere else. For international traveling though, all the airlines are giving a big portion of their deals and discounted fares to consolidators and wholesalers that they provide smaller agencies and websites with airfares. So when it comes to international traveling, then you may get a lower fare from an A Airline via an agency or a website than the airline itself. (Because the A Airline may have an agreement with the B travel agency to give them the right and sell their discounted deals). Many are complaining about the fares and fees. Well traveling is not a cheap “sport” any more. As about the competition, well, someone may say “but there are so many airlines”. True, but most of these airlines have merged into bigger alliances. The world’s major carriers have merged into 3-4 big groups that they expanded their “city service networks” and share price and policies. So instead for 20-30 airlines, they are basically 3. So for us the consumers, we get the one or the two of them from each city. (this mean we get 1 or 2 fares to pick from) The one or the other airline alliance. (some major cities are luckier because they may get all 3 alliances plus some other ethnic carriers that don’t belong to any of the big groups and they are just offering an extra choice of airfare. 


Seating Assignment has become a joke too now days. It used to be free, yet the past years the airlines discovered this idea to sell the seating pre-assignment. You buy your tickets on April to travel in June and you want to assign the seats. You have to pay a fee. (Makes me wonder what we will pay next). Luckily you can go get the free seat assignment at the airport the day of your departure.
Travel insurance. Often I get asked about it. Another way for the agencies to make profit. Most airlines and the trip insurances waive and forgive penalties if you are very sick. But only if you are sick. Neither the airlines nor the travel insurance will cover you for any other reason. (yet many don’t realize this and buy insurance anyways). Some major airlines will cover you and waive the fees if you are really sick, so no reason to buy any insurance. Unless of course you booked with one of the few carriers that do not accept medical reasons for cancellations or changes. Then it is worth it. Although most of the times it is a waste of money. You end up paying way too much and sometimes it is not needed if the airline covers you for medical reasons anyways. 
Nothing is guaranteed either. Penalties, fares, fees, all are subject to change. Even your paid seating assignment. Basically the airlines under their guidelines can do anything they want and you can’t do a thing about it. 


When you try to book keep in mind to search for at least 4-5 months in advance from the month you want to travel. (this is for international tickets, not domestic tickets within the U.S.) The airlines have introduced this term called “advance purchase” which it works to discourage travelers and overcharges them if they try to call within a week or two from their desired departure date to buy tickets. If let’s say an economy ticket cost $1000 (if you book it a month or more in advance). If you try to buy the same ticket within three or four weeks, or like sometimes people do, within one or two weeks the price skyrockets. That same ticket ends up costing $2000-$3000. So try avoiding booking within a week or two and last minute tickets. It was a time that worked well for deals, but not anymore. 


So what about the Special Sales?


Prices go down once in a while too, as sales/demand mandates. The airlines monitor their flights and once the sales drop, in order for the to fill the flights they release ""special sales"" to fill up the flights. Remember the goal is to send the aircraft full.


These hints and tips are applying mainly to the big carriers. (such as Delta, United, American, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, etc). Low cost carriers such as Spirit, Southwest, Ryan Air etc that sell tickets directly from their websites and not through any of the official reservation platforms around the globe, they are a different story and most of the above information isn't applying for them.


I am sure there are certain exceptions to all the above but this is how the airline industry works now days, the majority of the times. Hope it helps. Good ticket hunting.","[""You make it sound like ticket prices rise in a predictable, straight line from 6 months out until the week before...but this just simply isn't true.\n\nYou fail to mention that prices go down, too, as sales/demand mandates.\n\nWhile purchasing a ticket long in advance will get you a better price more often than not (in my personal experience) it's far from being set in stone. \n\nAnd with regards to airlines having consumers by the balls via lack of competition, this reality is mitigated by the fact that airline tickets are an elastic good.

Or sometimes it doesn\'t sound as we wanted it to be. That been said, great remarks and I always encourage and appreciate a good critique.', 'Personally I agree with you, though the opinion may vary between other mods. The problem for me is trying to be fair in the allowing or removal of user submitted photos... if they provide some context and follow the submission guidelines, we simply let the up/down voting take care of the mediocre photos.  \n  \nIf you have any suggestions or further discussion for such, we are always interested to improve the sub.', 'I agree with you, perhaps a photo related with the content on each paragraph would have created a less boring and plain post.

Anyways, a good critique is always appreciated.', 'Well let me answer to both points. \nThe majority of the ""big carriers"" (such as Delta, United, American, Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways etc.) don\'t offer currently and for the past decade any commission to any agency or website. Which means in order for an agency or website to profit they must add more on top of it. (as about agreements and codeshares, it is what I do for 20 years, my specialty so trust me, I know). So when you go to an agency there is a 99% chance to not find cheaper fare comparing to the carrier directly. Either same or higher. Plus most agents (not all) they wont give you all the goodies you get when you go directly to the airline\'s website. Hence why now days most of the younger crowd ended up directly to the airline website to book (for domestic tickets). But let me also add, what I am saying here is for the major ""big"" carriers, not low cost airlines such as Spirit, Ryan Air, SouthWest etc. As about the second point. What I said surely has its exceptions. But hey if you want to side up with the 1% exception wait till last minute. One of the mistakes I did though was that I didn\'t specify that I was referring to international traveling. (and try to book United States to Europe within 2 weeks to see what\'s happening yourself.) Your answer was with examples of smaller airlines that are mainly for US domestic market, which what I wrote is not applying. (again my mistake that I didn\'t specify, that I was talking for international trips mainly). Domestic traveling surely you don\'t have to wait 4-5 months. But then again I thought that there is some common sense around. (guess not). As about last minute sales, surely they exist, when the airline cannot sell in a flight the last tickets that are usually higher economy they release a sale to fill the flight. Anyways to close to my answer. What I wrote are hints and tips to save the consumer and educate most of them out there of how the system works. (for international traveling mainly). You can ignore the above and keep doing what you re doing. After all I am referring to international traveling airfares and I have the feeling you were talking for domestic deals within the U.S. (two different things)', 'Thank you for understanding my point.

This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing. So if you are trying to understand what I wrote with doing only domestic trips within the U.S most likely the article will not make sense to you. Speaking of sources to prove the above, realistically speaking, I will have to attach reports and confidential airline agreements to prove most of the above or perhaps a video. People can always ask a travel agent or google some of the things i wrote, or search for relevant video on youtube. Regarding the way the classes of service work and the prices, you can call an airline directly and ask. They will confirm it. Youtube has also video that shows how the reservations are made in GDS (worldspan, amadeus, sabre or gallileo/apollo). Regarding the paid seating assignment, its all over the internet too.The advance purchase that makes the prices skyrocket if you try to book within 2-3 weeks from your departure date is different per airline but you can try to book something from US to EU for example, and compare the price by booking the same thing with departure in 2 weeks and departure in 2 months or more. I could have provide some links that support everything but again, my idea was to talk about all the above since they are issues that we go through for years with agencies and retail clients.

Also removed the line ""The way it goes, in a few years only the wealthier ones will be able to travel and much harder for the lower middle class folks."" It came out wrong the way I wrote it. Something i forgot to mention and i noticed in the reservation systems. I noticed that for the past 2 decades the 2 elements that create an ticket, the base fare and taxes are changing. I observed that the base fare (what the airline was selling the ticket for) is lowering slowly while the taxes are going higher every year. (once a ticket with Delta from New York to somewhere in Europe was costing $800 which the $100 were what the airline was charging for the ticket and the $700 were fed. taxes, fuel fees etc. Most of the times the 2 are kind of half and half though. Which means, that the big websites that show you a $900 and then they write plus $150 taxes lie to us. Even though the final cost to us as a consumer will be the same amount, they list as tax a way less amount than what we see in the back end when processing the tickets for agencies or websites.']"

I dont know if anyone will ever read this, but in case someone is in a future situation and does a search on ""Lost Luggage"" on r/travel (the way i did before I posted this)- this is what happened.   


1. Really focused on working with Swiss Air- which was hard because even though I had a claim number with Swiss Air AND a missing baggage tracer number with SEZ airport- there was consistently no progress.
2. Swiss Air sent me from desk to desk and email to email address with no response. I persisted with polite follow ups.
3. On August 9th- My friend got an email from Air Seychelles (not even an airline that she was even BOOKED ON) that her baggage was flying to JHB and then to CPT to be delivered to my house. 
4. We didn't count our chickens before they were hatched. She was leaving to go back to the US on 13th August. 
5. On Sunday August 11th I got a phone call (repeat:on a Sunday!) that the bags were being delivered to my house.
6. They arrived! No damage, nothing stolen and a HUGE ball of luggage tags on the handles for us to trace where and when the luggage arrived.

TLDR; we don't know how or who or what party took ultimate responsibility to get the bags back to my friend, but they were ultimately found and returned. My friend is now back in the US with all of her luggage. The luggage was missing and not found on any system for 18 days. We had all but given up hope. Reminder: Always be polite to customer services folks. No matter how frustrated you are!

Hello All-

I am a pretty experienced world traveller and lifelong expat. I have found my own lost luggage in the past - dealt with lost luggage in Moscow, Abu Dhabi, you name it, I have always found it.Right now I am helping a friend with this lost luggage situation and I am STUMPED on what to do next.

Situation- on July 27th after a layover, My American friend was traveling from LHR via ZRH to SEZ. After she checked in at LHR with Swiss Air and checked her 2 bags, She got ill at the airport and ended up missing her flight to ZRH and also her connection to SEZ (note- this flight is 1x/week). She was only going to be in SEZ for 4 days before traveling onward throughout Africa to some remote locations on holiday with a group- so she was scrambling to get to Mahe and immediately rebooked herself on Etihad through AUH and then onward to SEZ/Mahe.

Since she is without consistent telecoms and I have experience with this stuff, I offered to help track it down. I am in CPT and the last stop on her trip before she returns to the US.

1. After she landed She filed a report with airport in Mahe to get a claim number, but they continued to follow up with Etihad and never with Swiss. ( I have also been calling them to follow up)
2. I have contacted Etihad several times but they claim that the luggage was never transferred over from Swiss to them.
3. Swiss wont say whether the luggage was removed to tarmac in LHR or it was offloaded in ZRH.
4. Complicating the issue is that the Baggage ID tags do NOT come up in World Tracer.
5. Every time I contact Swiss in LHR they give me a new direction- call this number, go to the website and file a customer support ticket and get a number, email this person, etc. It has been SIX days and no response from ANY of it.
6. I have gone through Twitter, and the idiots manning the Swiss twitter account told me to go to missing property at LHR.
7. I have contacted LHR and they said that airlines do NOT turn in bags to missing property and to work with the airline.
8. Literally all of this on repeat.","[""If luggage was left with Swiss at check-in, it is THEIR responsibility. It's always the first airline. If nobody picked it up in ZRH or one of the stop-over cities, the first airline is still responsible. That'd be Swiss. Removed to tarmac in LHR or offloaded in ZRH, it is irrelevant, they ARE responsible!"", ""I have never been in this situation before, so I am just guessing here. I apologize in advance if it's not helpful. But since you say the luggage isn't in the tracker, to me, that implies that they pulled it from the LHR flight. It would not surprise me if, for security reasons, they check to make sure that all luggage is attached to a passenger who they know the status of.\n\n(The rule of thumb I have heard in the US is that airlines are allowed to have bags fly without passengers if it is because the airline makes the decision, such as due to a missed connection or forced rerouting, but not if the passenger doesn't show up or initiates the change on their own.)\n\nI would bet that once pulled from the flight, these bags got extra-special attention from LHR Security. It's possible, I suppose, that they immediately treated it as a possible bomb and detonated it, but you would think if that were the case they would be super interested in talking to the person who left it. So that's unlikely.\n\nIf you haven't already, my suggestion would be to google the direct numbers for the SwissAir luggage desk at LHR, as well as LHR Security. The most likely answer is that the luggage is sitting in some office in LHR, and they don't know where to return it to, since it's not in the system. I think you need to find the right person's desk phone and call it.\n\nGood luck!"", ""When she didn't get on board the flight, her bags were removed at Heathrow and sent to lost luggage in baggage claim. Missing items is for someone who leaves an ipad behind. If you miss a flight, then your ticket is cancelled which is likely why the tracer number doesn't work. You have to contact the [airline](https://www.heathrow.com/arrivals/baggage-reclaim) for the baggage. Keep trying all these options on the [Swiss site](https://www.swiss.com/unitedkingdom/en/contact-us-in-the-uk)."", 'Don’t forget one of the thing could’ve happened. If she if she had a really nice bag, the luggage was probably stolen. This happened to me on a flight from Zürich to Washington DC. Expensive bag, first time I used it, never to be found.￼', ""it sounds like she did things incorrectly and abandoned the luggage. you can't switch travel plans mid-trip without notifying anyone then expect the airline to clean up the mess. she would have had to cancel the itinerary in person at the counter, wait for them to remove the bags and deliver them to the luggage office at the baggage claim area, then go to the next airline's counter and check in properly. this is 100% on them and they can only hope that it eventually shows up in swiss airlines abandoned luggage process. your friend is an idiot, not the airlines. that is not how the process works, at all, and you can't jump on the social media shame train and try to say it was their fault."", 'Honestly, what is the problem to just go through insurance and getting the value of the goods?\n\nBy the time you resolve it how would they get the stuff to her. Also your bag tag has a liability waiver on it that absolves airlines in most cases of luggage damage.', 'Yeah- I have abandoned asking Etihad for any assistance.   \n\n\nFor the record, Etihad is incredibly nice to work with and the Swiss- not so much.', ""Thanks for your thoughts! Even just typing my post out made me think about the security aspect for the first time. So talking about this conundrum helps a lot.   \nI have obviously been working heavily with Swiss Air, but I haven't contacted LHR Security yet.   \nSwiss Air staff haven't (or won't for security reasons) tell me if it is procedure to remove bags without a passenger boarded prior to take off, or if they were removed in Zurich and grounded.   \nOne staff member gave me a number in Zurich for baggage but they wouldn't help me because Zurich wasn't the final destination for the passenger.\n\nIt's worth an inquiry with LHR security as I reckon it is not a \\_terribly\\_ common occurrence for someone to check in, check bags and then not arrive for the flight- but also- airport staff have literally seen it all!"", 'I am not in disagreement with you. It’s not how I would’ve done it. But I’m helping a friend so I am trying to deduce what she has done and figure out a solution.  \n\nAlso- haven’t used Twitter publicly- only DMs for contacting airlines/airports. So no public shaming from me.', ""Unfortunately Insurance does not even come near the value of the bags much less the goods. \n\nShe is flying back through LHR on the way home, she's willing to forgo having any of her personal items on her whole 3 week vacation to just locate the bags and get them back."", 'Geez! I would be pissed. Swiss is definitely responsible. Try calling their American phone numbers, I get better response from their American employees. It was the case with Lufthansa.', ""I guess one question would be: without getting into the nature of your friend's illness (since it's really none of our business), do you know if anyone ever notified the airline that she would be missing her flight while she was being treated in the airport? That might have made a difference in terms of how the airline and the airport would have handled her bags."", 'Does she have a travel insurance at all? Most comprehensive ones will cover up to a high amount if you file it correctly. I would hope she has a good one especially if going to remote places in Africa.', 'This is also a good idea! Thanks!', ""So- she talked to Swiss after she missed the flight. She wasn't treated in the airport, she was indisposed in the Ladies facility. Since her final destination is only serviced 1x/week by Swiss, she told them that she would be rebooking with another airline. But by the time she rebooked and got on a flight to AUH, she could not contact Swiss and tell them her new travel plans. It was not ideal, but it was a huge rush to try to get to her first destination and join her group."", ""Yes she has travel insurance but I don't know her policy details.""]"
116,"Cabin luggage, type and size?",3,9j16zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9j16zj/cabin_luggage_type_and_size/,12,1537985562.0,"Hi there!

I am looking for a new cabin luggage.

Most airline that I checked allow 55x40x23cm to be taken inside the cabin, however, some allow only 55x40x20cm. Do these 3cm really make a difference? Now is the question what type of the luggage I should take, hard or soft? I guess the 23cm soft luggage could be squeezed into 20cm, while the hard one most likely can't. Also, I really like the 4 wheels many hard ones have. On the other hand, they do take a lot of space, so maybe it might be better to go with a 2 wheel version which doesn't take as much space.

So here are 2 examples to illustrate the dilemma: HARD: [https://www.samsonite.at/lite-box-spinner-55cm--deep-red/79297-1285.html?cgid=SAMS080](https://www.samsonite.at/lite-box-spinner-55cm--deep-red/79297-1285.html?cgid=SAMS080) SOFT: [https://www.samsonite.at/spark-sng-upright-toppocket-erweiterbar-55cm--schwarz/87550-1041.html?cgid=SAMS080](https://www.samsonite.at/spark-sng-upright-toppocket-erweiterbar-55cm--schwarz/87550-1041.html?cgid=SAMS080)

The hard one is lighter and 20cm thick, but it also has a way lower volume than the soft one. What is usually the bigger issue, volume or the weight? I tend to think the volume might be the bigger issue here...

Which are good luggage brands to buy that offer good value/cost ratio?

If you have any other opinion or advice, please post it and help me make an informed decision?

What do you think?","[""It's better to have a bag that complies with the airline's baggage allowances. Maybe 90% of the time they won't check, but you can't guarantee you'll always be in the 90% not checked and you don't want to put a damper on your trip before you've even got on the plane. \n\nIn the matter of hardcase vs softcase I prefer a hardcase as I feel it offers more security against theft and also pest infestations (like bedbugs). However I'm not 100% in either camp because I'm not the hugest fan of mini suitcase style cabin bags. I feel like they quickly become impractical if you have to do any sort of journey that's not just airport  to taxi to hotel door. And the nice ones can get very expensive to the point where I'd feel the need to baby the case and worry about damage. \n\nI mean 4 wheels is lovely on a nice smooth surface inside the airport and if you travel for business I can see it, but suitcases are hell down narrow, crowded or unevenly surfaced roads. Loud and unwieldy. You also need an extra bag if you want to access passport/money/keys/paper or any other essentials quickly and easily on board or on the street. \n\nHonestly I prefer a rucksack or any other bag you can shoulder. Not like a huge backpacker one, just a reasonably sized discreet one, although outdoor companies like deuter offer very very nice backpacks with all the bells and whistles for less than a very very nice wheelie cabin case would cost. Rarely will it get checked (put in the hold) either."", ""Never in my life have I compared my carry-on bag, or potential carry-on bag, to an airline's baggage dimensions.

When I went to go pay for the ticket, it said I owed $1,000, even though I had enough miles. I called up American and they said these are all taxes imposed by BA.

Part of that though is UK departure taxes, that is nearly $200 alone.\n\nWhy not use the AA miles to get to Belgium, it is the same number of miles.  You can use AA, Iberia, BA etc connections to get there.  The taxes are much lower if you fly  American across the Atlantic.', 'Yea, I hear BA is notorious for their taxes **and surcharges**.

Brussels is often cheap to fly into."", 'I just went to make a fake booking on the BA website for that trip and it says ""Taxes, fees and carrier charges for the entire journey are approximately $694.50 - $1172.40 per adult and are included in the prices above."" at the bottom. \n\nIt\'s worth noting that the hypothetical fare I chose came to $1071 all up though, in economy.

121,Vietnam Visa (from USA) - I'm really confused and here's my research so far.,1,63q2n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/63q2n3/vietnam_visa_from_usa_im_really_confused_and/,15,1491472630.0,"I've looked through several Reddit threads and various blogs found in searches. It sounds like recently the rules have changed and the process for getting a visa is a bit complicated at the moment. 

Also there are a ton of reports of scammers so I'm trying to do this through the appropriate channels. 

Here's the process I've gathered so far. Can anyone give any advice?

I followed the instructions from the official [Vietnam Embassy (US) site.](http://vietnamembassy-usa.org/consular/visa-application-process)
This sends you to [this site.] (https://visa.mofa.gov.vn/Homepage.aspx)

Here you:

* Fill out their online form.

* Upload a photo as described.

* At the end of the process, they give you a completed PDF, Application ID, and an Application Code.

* At this point it sounds like I need to mail the printed PDF, my passport, an unknown payment amount, and a return envelope to the embassy in Washington, DC.

* Also there are various posts mentioning different Visa duration and costs.

I'm hesitant to mail my passport to them without talking to someone at the embassy. 
I've tried calling and emailing just today after office hours, but I was hoping someone might have been through this recently. 

If not, I'll update this post when I figure it out.  




**Answer:** Since I'm travelling for less than 30 days I can use an eVisa: https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn

122,My First Experience with American,0,bbyqsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bbyqsh/my_first_experience_with_american/,15,1555010972.0," 

Good morning guys. I wanted to write my frustration with American Airlines. I live down in Miami, but I always drive up to Fort Lauderdale to fly with Southwest. this time,  I, along with my family, flew out of Miami to Chicago. Although I had to pay for bag fees, and dumb seat fees in order for us to sit together, the flight from Miami to Chicago was great.

 On our way back to Miami, we had a connecting flight at Charlotte. First, I paid again the crazy seat fees and bag fee, our flight from Chicago got delayed and lost the connecting flight. Then, they switches us to a flight that was going to Fort Lauderdale. That flight was getting delayed every 30 minutes since 9 p.m. They cancelled it at midnight with the same bad weather excuse, and told us to go to customer service to change it. They delayed and cancelled a bunch of flights that night with the same bad weather excuse. What i found weird was that on the airport screen, I had noticed that Delta, United, and Southwest flights were on time. Only American flights were getting delayed and gate changed every now and then. In conclusion guys, I had to call work to tell them that I couldn't make it to work the next day, buy food, and sleep at the airport with my family. There were pregnant women, little kids, very old people, and American Airlines didn't even give food or place to sleep. I just wanted to share my experience, as I might not fly with them again.","['I’m not a big fan of American Airlines either but what you explained can happen with any airline. The airline doesn’t really control weather delays and it could have been the weather at you departure or arrival location causing problems. If it was your destination city that is why other airlines might not have seemed to be an issue. \n\nAlso, I am not aware of any airline that provide accommodations in the event of a weather delay.  I have had flights canceled on multiple airlines for weather and was never given anything. It’s just one of those travel things that you have to deal with.', ""I imagine that the reason you chose American over driving to FLL was because the tickets were a lot cheaper.  If you can't be separated from family members for 2 hours then the seat fees aren't really dumb or crazy,  Still seems as if all the fees together must have been less than flying SW."", 'Not a fan of AA but this can happen.  Be careful when booking though, you should never have to pay fees to pick a seat, whatever you saved by flying basic economy (this is the only class that you cannot pick your seats at purchase), you for sure payed out in baggage and seat fees.  But honestly, I would prefer to miss a day of work and be stuck in an airport then have a pilot attempt to land a plane in limited visibility with me in it just saying', ""IMO, airlines from USA suck compared to foreign airlines. I've had my share of terrible flights with United, American and Delta. Jet blue has been pretty decent. The whole flying process is already stressful enough. Sorry you went through that."", 'Airlines from the US are bar none the worst I’ve ever been on, and I’ve flown in many developing countries.

This year I'll be flying to Denver, Colorado on Frontier Airlines out of MDW, and am also tentatively planning a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana for early October (most likely on Delta from BMI); the problem with this strategy is I'm only picking the cheapest individual flight I can find on Hipmunk, which doesn't necessarily work to my long term advantage.

Next year I am 85% confident I'll be going to Sweden in July (most likely on KLM); other significant destinations of varying confidence intervals are Canada (probably Toronto), Seattle, California, New York, New Jersey, and South Carolina.  There may be more, but those are the ones to which I think I'm likely to fly.  I also know I'll be traveling to Iowa, Wisconsin, and Missouri, but those are drivable distances.

I don't care very much about getting status or flying exceptionally comfortably (or don't understand why not caring is a bad idea), just flying cheap with a minimum of civil rights violations.  I'm not currently taking advantage of any credit card rewards or frequent flier programs and don't know where to begin.

How can I minimize my average cost of flying over the long term?  This includes the cost of taking vacation days in order to travel, which is why I try not to drive places more than 4 hours away and won't drive places more than 8 hours away.  Similarly, I avoid Amtrak because it means taking a vacation day just to travel, even though the dollar cost is cheaper.

There are many perks to status, most of which many people don't care for (priority seats, priority boarding, priority bags, etc) but status also gives you up to 3 checked bags free and bumps you from 50 pounds per bag to 70 pounds on some airlines. That right there can save you about $200-$300 each way\n\nBesides that, if you make it to Platinum level, you get 100% bonus for miles flown. Let's say you fly ORD - STO. A round trip will get you 8,540 miles.\n\nIf you had status, you would get 17,080 or for American Airlines, enough for a one-way domestic ticket in the US.\n\nYou also qualify for a lot more bonuses and offers that aren't available to non-status people. And they waive (or highly decrease) fees like booking fees or flight change fees.\n\nYou might love me for this\n\n[225k AA miles from credit card bonus](http://www.qtripper.com/travel-news/201108/95_225000-american-airlines-miles-credit-card-offers/)\n\nThat is enough for about 8 or 9 round trip domestic awards, which will dramatically reduce your expenses\n\nAlso, for about $240 you can do a Platinum Challenge on American Airlines, where you fly 10,000 points (different than miles, depends on fare class) in a 90 day period and get Platinum status until Feb 2013\n\n[This is a starter guide to help you understand frequent flyer programs](http://www.qtripper.com/travel-news/200909/35_how-i-flew-in-first-for-40-and-how-you-can-too-part-1-eqms/)"", 'It may be worthwhile to drive to Chicago and fly from there rather than depart from a regional airport.

The Sweden trip will be for at least one week, and probably five weeks, depending on how the budget sorts out.\n\nThat 225k AA miles is pretty awesome.  I have a Citibank card, but its side benefits on it are pretty worthless, no more than a 10% discount on stuff.\n\nI'm not sure if I can manage the Platinum Challenge with my travel schedule; I'm headed to events in these cities, so my schedule isn't very flexible.  Generally I'm doing one to two events a month, but none of the long-distance events are in the same month.  It will be close; Denver's about 1000 miles away, Seattle 2000, which works out to 6000 miles.

Traveling by train to Chicago takes at least four hours (versus 2.5 by car), and the trains depart at 6:10 AM, 10:14 AM, or 7:59 PM.  There are few flights that leave after midnight, so I wind up having to use the 10:14 AM departure, meaning an extra half day of vacation.  Conversely, if I have a 4 PM flight, I can leave work at noon and arrive at the airport plenty of time.  If they ever add HSR, the value proposition may change, but that's probably not economically feasible.  Additionally, BMI's parking being free and closer means that anything leaving from Chicago has to be significantly cheaper to be a net gain (and I think ORD/MDW are more likely to be affected by weather delays than BMI, but I don't know that empirically).\n\nFor the Sweden trip, I have to arrive at my final destination no later than 3 PM (and even that's cutting it close), and it's a 1.5-3 hour travel time to get from ARN to my final destination, so any flight has to arrive before noon.  The latest departing flight that gets to ARN in time leaves at 4:25 PM, so I should be at the airport no later than 1:25 PM, given the desired three-hour lead time I should either get someone to drive me to the airport or take a cab (which is likely still cheaper than paying for parking).

When I overnight in Sydney before a flight I use any free time to wander that great city as part of the trip.

We’ve been flexible with our dates and noticed just recently that traveling in April to Lima offered plenty of options to fly for 15,000 miles each way per person (from Chicago). I saw this as recently as Tuesday, November 18. I was going to finally commit and buy our tickets yesterday, Sunday, November 23, when the tickets jumped to 35,000 each way per person! Our trip essentially went from requiring 60,000 total miles to 140,000 miles in the course of a few days!
 
I called the AAdvantage customer service line yesterday to see if they have a good reason for the price hike and the nice lady on the other end didn’t have a clear cut answer, just told us to keep checking every day for a change in prices. She was able to arrange a trip for 17,500 per person each way from Chicago to Miami to Lima, but on the way back could only get us to Miami, and not the whole way home. She is holding this travel itinerary for us until Friday at midnight. This option will cost us approximately $685 ($ to purchase additional miles plus $250 for one way tickets home MIA>ORD)….
 
Do any of you redditors out there have any familiarity with the MileSAAver option with American Airlines AAdvantage program? There has to be a schedule and reason for the changes, right? I feel like using 60,000 miles + $685 to get to Peru would be a waste of miles when we could just buy two tickets for $1,400 total. Our current miles balance is 55,000. We knew we’d have to buy 5,000 miles anyways for ~$150 (no big deal in the grand scheme of things), but paying $150 vs $1,400 on airfare is a big deal to us.

tl;dr Messed around on flight booking website at 3am, accidentally booked plane tickets two weeks early. What do I do.

So, for a while I've been talking with some close friends in the US about visiting for a month. I'm fairly inexperienced with airtravel, so yesterday after a long night I was poking around the American Airlines website booking section. I filled out the whole thing and was going to close the tab just before payment. Here's where I fucked up. 

The last time I bought things with Paypal at the end of September, there were two confirmation steps before you were charged. One where you selected where to withdraw the funds from, and the other to finalize the purchase. I looked at what I thought was the first of the two and thought I saw something to the tune of ""You will finalize your purchase on the next page"", so I just clicked through. And then I was looking dumbfounded at a page saying booking complete.

So now I've got plane tickets for 6am this Sunday and haven't prepared in the slightest. I told the people I was going to be staying with about the whole thing and they're fine with me showing up early, but I'm not sure if I'll be ready to go in time. What are my options here? Should I contact the airline and try to change the date of the flight? I'm out doing work for most of the day so I don't have a lot of time to figure out the options myself until later tonight.

Edit: Going to give them a call and see if I can get refunded, or at least reschedule. Thanks for the suggestions everybody!

EDIT 2: I called them, and was told that I had the option to either reschedule the flight within 24 hours of booking, OR get hit with a $200 fee and be able to use the remainder towards another ticket booked within a year. I opted to reschedule and actually got $40 off the flight, so everything worked out! Thanks again.","[""Don't waste your time posting on reddit.

Due to a situation that's come up at home, I was hoping to catch an early flight that day; there are numerous flights available all throughout the day, starting at 6:30 AM.

When I called the reservation line to try and make a same day switch, the person I was speaking to told me that they were unable to put me on the 6:30 AM flight or any other earlier flight for that matter, due to there being no ""inventory."" However, the website shows seats available for all flights Thursday that get me from RSW to SEA. 

Furthermore, when I asked if I could just get to the airport early that morning and go on standby, I was told that was also not an option due to aforementioned lack of ""inventory"" and even if I went to the airport at 4:30 AM, no agent at the gate would allow me to go on standby. The only solution initially offered was for me to swap flights for a fee of $490, when the 6:30AM flight is $455. Then, the American rep on the phone literally suggested I just book the 6:30 as a one-way ticket so I could ""save on fees"" and framed it like she was being helpful. 

Any advice on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated; I fly frequently, but this has been my first time with American in many, many years, and I've forgotten how awful of a company they are.

137,"Question: Travelling to Western Europe without any experience. Loose Itinerary, looking for input on contemplated destinations/time spent there",0,7v6zvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7v6zvg/question_travelling_to_western_europe_without_any/,14,1517783321.0,"Hello /r/travel!

US Citizen looking to cross the Atlantic for the first time with a buddy and both of us are complete Europe virgins.

Allotting approximately 10 days in early June 2018(trying to get it in during good weather, but JUST prior to peak season) and are thinking of sticking to western Europe for this crossing.

Current thoughts are on dividing time between Ireland, England, and Spain. I've done some research in planning European trips in general and a common warning I've seen is to no try and pack itineraries too full, so I'm open to trimming one of those countries out. 

More than that, I am looking for ideas, suggestions, and advice. Friend and I would be interest in historic sites/buildings, outdoorsy activities, and are big soccer fans(I know it's a crime to call it such, but said soccer to distinguish from presumptive American Football when I say it).

Having never been to any of these places, let alone in June, was looking to pick some of your experienced brains regarding ideal locations. 

Off of the top of my head, the general idea was to split time evenly in the Dublin/London/Barcelona areas, but I am also completely open to suggestions of ""You can do so much better splitting time x way and see y"" or ""X region has y events going on around that time of year."" 

Regarding budget: not working with a super tight coin purse (I've prepared about 3K USD outside of arrival and departing flight, and lodging is a 50/50 split between friend and I) but am also inclined to be economical within reason whereas I don't necessarily feel like I have to blow all of that in order to have a successful trip. So, for example, a friend recently went to Barcelona and advised it was rather inexpensive now, I wouldn't rule out spending more time in Spain than the UK. 

Lodging: Looking to stay in hotels, but don't need a five star resort. Traditionally, my friend and I when we travel domestically will stay in your typical 2.5-3 star holiday inns, etc. Would consider paying more for better location/walking distance as we don't plan to rent a car.

Travel: We're both quite low maintenance, so local travel we were thinking public transport/buses/trains, and between these locations something like ryanair or similar airline.


I apologize if my post is vague. Bottom line, those of you who have been to these places, I don't expect you to tell me what I want to do. I'm interested to see that if, given someone gifted you a trip like this, how you would divide it, where you would spend your time, and the things you would do (even if we don't have shared interests, it'll at least give me ideas and insight).

139,My Spirit Airlines horror story,0,4xshkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4xshkf/my_spirit_airlines_horror_story/,14,1471275089.0,"Warning: this is a pretty long story, so scroll down to the TL;DR at the end if you just wanna get the main points.

This past weekend, I went with a friend up to Boston to visit another friend we hadn't seen in a while. The last time we came up, we drove from Washington DC to Boston. It took about 18 hours round trip and we had to take a day off of work to do it. This time, I found a great deal on a flight out of Baltimore (BWI) going into Boston that only cost $197 round trip from Spirit Airlines! I did some research and saw that Spirit didn't get the best reviews because they charge for LITERALLY everything -- carry on bags larger than a small duffel, printing out your boarding pass for you at the airport, even a cup of water on their flights. My friend and I decided that we could only needed a small bag of clothes for the weekend, and that the flight was only an hour and 8 minutes so how bad could it be? If this meant we didn't have to take a day off of work or drive 18 hours to Boston and back it's still worth it.

The issues started when our flight to Boston was delayed two hours on Thursday night due to thunderstorms up in New York state on the east coast. Now of course we didn't blame the bad weather on Spirit, but let's just say it wasn't the best start to the trip.

Fast forward to Sunday night (tonight/last night since it's technically Monday now...) when our flight is supposed to be leaving at 8:55pm from Boston to get us back to BWI. At 4:20pm we get an email from Spirit warning us about a delay or cancellation with our flight. After going to the website and checking our flight's status, we see that it's now not scheduled to depart until 11:36pm. At this point we're a little angry, but we figure this just means we get to hang out with our friend longer and we can get a real dinner together before we leave. 

At around 9pm after we're already back at our friend's house with all of our stuff packed and ready to go, we check our flight's status again and find that now it's not scheduled to leave Boston until 1:45am Monday morning! Needless to say now we're a little more pissed off. We talk about having to possibly take off of work tomorrow, since by the time we get back to DC it'll be around 4:30am, and we are usually both at work by 8:30am. But luckily since our friend lives 15 minutes away from the airport, we can hangout with him until the flight.

This is when everything went really wrong. We get to the airport at around 12:30am for our 1:45am flight, figuring that we should have plenty of time since we checked an app my friend had that said the TSA wait time was 0 minutes. But when we got to the airport, all of the TSA checkpoints were closed! We ran back and forth from security gate to security gate to try and find someone who could help get us through so that we could board our plane. We ended up finding around 10 other passengers who were in the exact same situation as us, and one FLIGHT ATTENDANT that was supposed to be on that plane! After talking with one of the airport workers, they suggested that since no TSA agents were there, we should contact the state police so that they could escort us through security. So I called the state police and they directed us to go back to the original security gate we were at initially. After about 5 minutes of nervous waiting, we see a state police officer and talk to him about our situation. He says that from what he's hearing TSA is refusing to let the state police escort us through security, and that they closed the security gates because Spirit gave them the OK to since all of their flights were gone. But tonight, my flight was still waiting at the airport. Spirit didn't think to notify TSA that one of their flights was delayed until 1:45am and that they should have a couple of agents working until that flight left.

At around 1:20am, the police told us that there was no way we could get through to the other side of the security gate, and that a Spirit agent would refund or rebook our flights for free. The next available Spirit flight wasn't until Tuesday night, so my friend and I got a refund for the flight we missed. We booked an American Airlines flight to BWI for today and we both have to use up PTO/Sick Days for today too. The whole point of taking a flight out Sunday night and not driving was so that we wouldn't have to take any time off of work, and that it would be much easier to take a 1 hr 8 minute fight up to Boston then drive there and back. Spirit totally ruined that for us, and we will never forgive them. Now I have to use one of my 15 PTO days I get a year traveling back home because Spirit didn't do their job. Sure they refunded me for the flight, but will they pay me for the day of PTO I'm losing out on? Of course not. And for all of the people without a friend they can stay with tonight, they either have to sleep at the airport or pay for another night in a hotel.

If it was just me and my friend that missed the plane, maybe we could have told ourselves that we messed up and maybe we should have been at the airport earlier. But when 10 other passengers were in our exact same situation, and one of the flight attendants scheduled to fly on that plane was with us as well, there's no way it could just be our rotten luck. Spirit told TSA that they could pack up, and that's just what TSA did.

And that's why I'm NEVER flying on a Spirit airplane again.

TL;DR: Tried to fly home from Boston to BWI on Spirit, flight was delayed 5 hours, when I got to the airport 1 hr 15 mins before the flight TSA had closed all of the security gates because Spirit gave them the OK to, even though they had a flight scheduled to leave the airport at 1:45am. I'm going home on an American Airlines flight tomorrow.

I too was once ignorant that you had to be there for the original departure.  My flight kept getting delayed and then out of nowhere I got a notification that the departure had now been moved up two hours from the last delay time.

Yeah. That\'s how they keep costs so low. By charging for everything. You can fly spirit with a backpack full of stuff or a small carry on for no additional costs.

Of course you\'re not going to have the same services, amenities, and efficiency as massive airline corporations who charge much more.\n\nI have booked and ridden Spirit airlines flights numerous times and the only things one could generally complain about were things completely out of the airline\'s control like weather causing delays or the airport not having enough gates for airlines that share gates.\n\nThe TSA and security checks have nothing to do with Spirit. Spirit has no control over when airports open and close their TSA checkpoints and how many staffers they have.\n\n> Spirit didn\'t do their job.

All you paid for was a flight with them. It\'s not their job to pay you for vacation days that you missed because you didn\'t plan correctly. You didn\'t buy vacation days from them. You got back the product you bought.\n\nThis entire mess is completely and obviously your fault. You showed up at an airport past midnight when all of their service were closed. How is that even remotely Spirit\'s fault? You didn\'t bother to check their airports security hours online and you showed up less than two hours before your flight.

140,I just flew Spirit airlines and it was the best flight of my life. Highly recommend.,3,68gau3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/68gau3/i_just_flew_spirit_airlines_and_it_was_the_best/,14,1493598286.0,"I booked a 2 way flight out of DC to Tampa for me and my family. The flight there was with United, and back was with Spirit. Ive never flown Spirit, but have heard the bad stories. So I was very cautious and mentally prepared myself for some BS on the way back. Boy was I wrong.

Price- Short and simple, its ridiculously cheap. For 3 people I paid $180 for the flight back (thats with seat reservations)

""Extra Fees""- Spirit makes it very easy and simple and telling you what will cost extra. They send emails, notifications, and go over it on the website. In order to get ""surprised"" with anything, you literally have to ignore the dozen times they shove in your face the things that will cost more.

Luggage fees- They let you bring one personal item for free. My wife had a big bag, and I had a bookbag. Both of these were free. If we had a large suitcase we could have checked it in for $40 I believe, but we did not. We also had a stroller which was free as well.

Customer Service- Both the people at the gate and attendants where polite, clean, well dressed, and helpful. No problems there.

Plane Comfort/Appearance/Cleanliness- This was the biggest surprise for me. The plane I flew on with Spirit was amazing. Due to having no fat reclining seats (as if that extra 2 inch tilt of the seat makes a difference) there was so much room! Im talking the isle was wider, the leg room was more, it felt so ""open"" compared to anything I've flown before. The cabin was clean, well lit, and there was a lot of open seats so you could move around without any issues. Ive flown United both with Wifi entertainment, TV's in the seats, American Airlines, etc, and this was honestly the most comfortable plane simply because it was so roomie and open. It felts like the cabin was a lot bigger than other planes.

Refreshments- Yes, they are not free. And maybe if you are flying 6-8 hours that could be an issue. But our flight was 2 hours, and we had snacks and a drink we purchased at the airport with us so that was no issue. They came around with a large variety of food and drinks and I got myself some hard lemonade which was great.

Overall I would highly recommend flying Spirit. Ive heard a story where are girl had to pay for luggage, and the flight ended up having a layover and she had to pay again at the layover. That seems ridiculous and maybe someone screwed up. Other than that I have not heard any valid points as to why they are a ""bad"" airline because of their extra fees, since they go over it very clearly.

Anyway, just thought I would let you guys know. Enjoy!","[""I've been on a fair number of Spirit flights and never had a single problem.

My situation:  I am unskilled/unemployed (I do have a certain type of engineering degree, but I want to be an entrepreneur, not related to that field, so I say unskilled).  I am 32.  I have 1.2 million dollars in reserves from working for 11 years (also worked internships during college, and went to college on a big academic scholarship so most was payed for).  
  
I can fly for free (standby) anywhere that american airlines can fly (I am based in DFW).  
  
I am torn because most of all, I want to be an entrepreneur of some sort, and so I don't get excited about travel because I feel like I should be figuring out how to start a business and make money, since I am unemployed (I quit my job, I was not fired, I was actually highly esteemed and promoted within my company, it just wasn't what I wanted to do).  
  
I am wondering about maybe flying into Zurich or Madrid or London (they have a nonstop from dfw), but it seems like traveling around Europe can get pretty expensive.  I know places like Milan and Amsterdam are fun to see, but I don't even know how much fun I am going to have because I'm going to be worried about what I am doing with my life the whole time.  
  
Maybe I should forget about making a living for a couple months and just go travel and enjoy myself.  
  
I am wondering if maybe part of my drive has to do with my parent's expectations of me, and maybe that is not my expectation, and I need to find that out.  Maybe travel will help me get away from their reach, and help me figure things out on my own.  I am not sure.  
  
I feel so god damn confused right now, I have no one sane to talk to.  I don't know what to do for my next step, I don't know what is happening with my life.  I feel so overwhelmed, I am shaking while I am writing this.  
  
Which should be ridiculous because hey, I've got over a million dollars and I am only 32, I should feel good, right?  But I am scared that if I don't figure out a way to make more money that I'm just going to burn through this money, and then I will have to go back to my job, and quite honestly, I'm pretty sure I would rather be homeless.

It'll get you out of the house and you might find something you enjoy. I don't even mean in a foreign country, I mean nearby. Think of things you might like to do, then volunteer doing it. It's a great way to meet people and also it can put your own life in perspective a lot.\n\nAlso...as much as people say you can't buy happiness, you can. That $1.2m is the answer to every problem you have, you just don't know it. Use that money to pay for a life coach or a psychologist and they can help you sort through your problems. Use that money to go to college and get skilled in something! Use that money to buy a load of high class prostitutes to have an orgy with.\n\nThere's very little you can't do with that much money. The sky is your limit. If you're suffering because of that knowledge, pay somebody to help you understand where that suffering comes from."", ""There are a whole lot of people with a lot less money than you, but otherwise in the same circumstance (currently between ambitions), traveling around. \n\nMaybe there's some really firm barrier inside you that prevents you from letting go and enjoying yourself, but if not, I don't see any particular reason why you shouldn't do it. It'll be easier for you than all those other people, because you have a big cushion to fall back on afterwards."", 'I guess it depends on whether or not you\'re interested in travel.

I\'m 37 now and don\'t feel like my life is amounting to anything in my current situation. Even if I don\'t find the answers that I\'m looking for, I\'m thinking the experience will be valuable on its own.\n\nSome people don\'t like travel. Or they want ""everywhere else"" to be just like home, but with a different view. If you\'re not into travel, there\'s not much point in forcing yourself on a trip because it seems like the thing to do.\n\nI\'m thinking the experiences, networking, goal-setting, and unusual challenges inherent to travel could help you ""find yourself"". You\'ve got 11 years experience. Employers most likely won\'t care if you take a 6-month / 2-year sabbatical. Your savings are fine.

**When:** November 11, 2017 - December 10, 2017

**Where:** Yogyakarta **->** Nusa Dua **->** Nusa Lembongan **->** Kuta, Lombok **->** Gili Air **->** Ubud

So, my first country review.  Hopefully, the first of many.  This was our first stop after leaving Vietnam in November.  We wanted to go when we did in order to get there before rainy season started.  And I absolutely loved it.  It has this interesting mix of Muslim and Hindu cultures, amazing reefs and sea wildlife, cheap and tasty food, and a nice laid-back atmosphere.  It really does buy into the *""island life""* philosophy, and for the most part it felt like no one was in much of a hurry to do anything.

The time of the year was good, but not ideal.  We did get in before most of the rain started, and it only affected us on a handful of days (mostly in Yogyakarta).  Unfortunately, that meant it wasn't climbing season and we were told we would have little chance of getting to the top of any of the volcanos with clear weather.  It is probably the country I am most looking forward to getting back to on this whole trip, as there is a ton left to explore.  

Let's look at our **destinations**:

****

***Yogyakarta*** - 5 nights

**Rating** - 4/5

Our first journey involved a plane ride into Yogyakarta, a cultural hub within East Java also known as *Yogya* or *Jogja*.  I had wanted to go there ever since seeing footage of Borobudur in the film [*Baraka*] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSfFHxyYJJA) (highly recommended for anyone who loves good documentaries or wants travel inspiration).  I was pleasantly surprised by this little town that has a really artsy, young feel.  It is quiet but has enough going on to keep your interest for a few days.  The food is great here, and the people I met were some of the best throughout the whole trip.  You will need a motorbike to get around most of the time.

**Stayed** - **Abrakadabra Art BnB** - If you go to Jogja, stay here.  It was the first place we stayed on my trip and I think still my favorite.  Private rooms with private bath and [breakfast](https://imgur.com/eVPVO88) for ~$13 (dorms also available).  What makes this place special is the people who work there.  Jaly, the owner, is an amazing guy who felt more life a friend by the time we left.  At the time, the two other employees were Abie and Andy, who were fun and helpful.  At nights, I would hang around the common area as the guys would have their friends over and include us in with their activities.

**Did** - The main highlight was the drive out to [**Borobudur**](https://imgur.com/a/xPytUp7) - the world's largest Buddhist temple.  The combined ticket (with Prambanan) is pricey - $40 or $25 with student ID.  But it is worth it.  I've seen my fair share of temples, and this is up there as one of my favorites.  Set in the middle of hills and jungle, with volcanos in the background - it feels quite mystical.  It is also well kept, so you know your money is being put to use.  Take the ""back roads"" out for a great drive (1.5 hours) through the rice terraces.  There is also a strange [**chicken church**](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gereja-ayam) nearby that you can add onto your day trip.  Unfortunately, it started pouring on us while we were there so we couldn't see the church.  [**Prambanan**](https://imgur.com/a/UttWM9Y) is another nice temple, but more in the city so the surroundings aren't quite as spectacular.  Other than that, we walked around the square with Keraton and Taman Sari, but didn't go in.  We also took a few drives just exploring the nearby countryside.

****

***Nusa Dua*** - 1 night

**Rating** - 2/5

Next up, we took a flight ($37) over to Bali and caught a ride to Nusa Dua - probably the most expensive area on Bali.  Not really my cup of tea, but we were meeting my girlfriend's brother for a night.  Really difficult to get around (you will need a taxi to get anywhere).  I would not recommend this area unless you have a lot of money to blow and just want to relax.

**Stayed** - **The Westin Nusa Dua**  Fancy resort with a private beach and pool area.  About $150/night (!) without breakfast.  The beach is OK, and the pool area is really nice.  However, drinks and food are expensive, and it is next to impossible to get anywhere else to eat or drink.

**Did** - Drank beers around the pool and enjoyed some good sunshine by the beach.

****

***Nusa Lembongan*** - 4 nights

**Rating** - 5/5

After Nusa Dua, we took a Grab (the Uber of SE Asia) up to Sanur, and hopped on a boat to Lembongan ($11).  Nusa Lembongan was our first taste of [island life](https://imgur.com/n5Yvlry).  Part of a three island chain with Nusa Penida and Nusa Ceningan, though most people stay on Lembongan.  There are a couple of good beaches and some great snorkeling, and we really enjoyed the Hindu / island feel of it.  You will need a motorbike to get around most of the island area.

**Stayed** - **D'Mel Sari** - Good place with private rooms and bath for ~$19 with breakfast.  The owner is a nice guy but can be a bit too talkative.  He helped us sort out motorbikes and a snorkel trip.  Real close to the main road on the island and walkable to a lot fo restaurants and a decent beach.

**Did** - Rented motorbikes and explored the nearby beaches on Lembongan.  [**Dream Beach**](https://imgur.com/SsS9s1A) is the best of the bunch with good sand and water.  Mushroom Beach is filled with day trippers and can get quite busy.  [**The Devil's Tear**](https://imgur.com/hnbIQ5N) is a nice little photo op near Dream Beach.  We drove across the rickety but beautiful yellow bridge to **Nusa Ceningan** where there are some great bars along the Western coast road.  [Secret Beach](https://imgur.com/iOYuQ7c) there is quite nice.  We also found [**Driftwood Bar**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2538504-d9997141-Reviews-Abyss_Zipline-Nusa_Ceningan_Bali.html) that has a great infinity pool looking over the water that you can use for free after buying a drink.  One day, we took a boat from Nusa Lembongan (there is a pier near the Yellow Bridge) to **Nusa Penida**.  There we rented a motorbike and went to Angel's Billabong (*meh*), [Broken Beach](https://imgur.com/a/w6z28tj) (cool view, but no beach), and [**Kelingking Beach**](https://imgur.com/a/NT5N5SW) (possibly the most beautiful place I have ever seen).  If you are in the area - GO TO Kelingking, it's amazing.  You can take a very strenuous hike down to the actual beach area, or just enjoy the view from the top. *Note*: the roads on Penida are absolute shite, so be careful.  We also did a snorkeling trip ($11) with stops at Manta Bay (terrifying due to number of boats and ferocity of water) and Crystal Bay (really nice coral and abundant fish).  If I would do it again, I would just go to **Crystal Bay** myself - you can drive there on Nusa Penida - and do independent snorkeling.  Also, eat nasi campur at [**Warung Bu Edy**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1137831-d8369514-Reviews-Warung_Bu_Edy-Nusa_Lembongan_Bali.html) - cheap and delicious.

****

***Kuta, Lombok*** - 5 nights

**Rating** - 4/5

We took a ferry back to Sanur ($11) on Bali, and then a quick overnight and a flight to Lombok ($20).  From the airport, we caught a Grab down to Kuta (NOT to be confused with Kuta, Bali).  A small tourist town with some amazing beaches and good restaurants.  I would highly suggest making a stop here.  Again, you will need a motorbike to get around.

**Stayed** - **Airas' Homestay** - Loved this place.  A bit away from Kuta town, situated amongst the forest with monkeys climbing overhead and fresh coconuts to drink from their trees.  The owner is great, and has about 10 [private bungalows](https://imgur.com/a/oTIOdyB) (real basic but private bathroom) that face each other making a great social atmosphere.  Met some of my favorite people from this trip at this place.  We paid about $12/night.

**Did** - It's all about the beaches here.  Kuta beach itself wasn't great but I loved **Tanjung Aan beach**.  Great sand and great water with a steep drop off and some surfing out into the cove a bit.  The whole area is a surfing haven.  If you go to [Tanjung Aan](https://imgur.com/bgEu7PF), [**Warung Turtle**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2155769-d3296451-Reviews-Warung_Turtle-Kuta_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html) lets you park for free and has nice chairs to lay out if you buy a drink.  I took my first ever surfing lesson out at [**Selong Belanak Beach**](https://imgur.com/a/A1krEvI).  It was great and only cost $15.  This is a good place for beginner surfers, as the waves stay fairly predictable and small.  We also drove out to Mekaki Beach, but I would not recommend it.  The drive was about 3.5 hours one way, and the beach (while completely deserted) was not any nicer than the closer ones.  And 7 hours of driving in one day is a lot!  With that being said, they were building a new road at the time that might make it faster.  Make sure to go to [**Tomato Cafe**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2155769-d7055462-Reviews-Tomato_Cafe_Restaurant-Kuta_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html) for some surprisingly good pizza.  If you want to splurge, [**El Bazar**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2155769-d7312831-Reviews-El_Bazar_Cafe_Restaurant-Kuta_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html) has some great Mediterranean sampler platters.  Around sunset, make sure you go up to [**Ashtari Lounge**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2155769-d1071792-Reviews-Ashtari_Lounge_Kitchen-Kuta_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html) for an overpriced drink and [amazing view of the bay](https://imgur.com/z9m7Grp), but you may have to get there early for a window seat.

****

***Gili Air*** - 5 nights

**Rating** - 3/5

After we were spent on South Lombok, we shared a van to go up to Bangsal Port in the North and caught a local boat to Gili Air.  I don't remember the price but I think around $15 per person total.  I had wanted to go to Gili Air for a long time.  It is a quiet island with some good food, decent beaches, and decent snorkeling.  It's the best of the Gilis in my opinion, with Meno being too quiet and Trawangan being too party-oriented.  I didn't love it as much as I wanted to, and probably would have spent only 3 nights there if we could have.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend was bedridden for 3 days with food poisoning so we stuck around longer.

**Stayed** - **Villa Karang** -  A more expensive resort that has basic backpacker rooms off of the main hotel.  However, by renting the cheap room, you can still use their great pool and partake in their large breakfast buffet.  Cost us about $14/night.

**Did** - You can honestly walk around the whole island in about 2 hours.  The west side has some nice beaches and water to swim in that stays really shallow.  The east side of the island has restaurants where you can get fresh fish grilled with an unlimited salad bar and choice of potato for under $10 (tuna steak....yummmmm).  On the north east, I did some independent snorkeling off the coast but it wasn't great and there are a *ton* of sea urchins you need to watch for.  We also did a day long organized [snorkeling trip](https://imgur.com/a/7TyFMsn) for $8 that took us around to the other islands.  We saw 5 huge turtles (!) and tons of fish.  There is also a fairly cool underwater statue off of Meno that you can snorkel around.  For sunset, go to [**Mowies**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664667-d8120492-Reviews-Mowie_s_Bar-Gili_Air_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html) for some comfortable seats, good food, and great view of the sun setting over [Mt. Agung](https://imgur.com/CrOELQG).

****

***Ubud*** - 5 nights

**Rating** - 4/5

We were flying out of Denpasar, so we decided to spend the last 5 nights over in Ubud.  A (really hot and stuffy) boat ride and van transport to the town center cost about $22.  Ubud is a hip town in central Bali that is really nice if you can get past the pretentious yoga/granola feel to it.  There are a lot of great restaurants and day trips around.  You can manage to walk pretty much everywhere in town, but if you want to visit some of the nearby temples or rice terraces you will need a motorbike.

**Stayed** - **Christina's AirBnb** -  This place was a great private room and bathroom in a shared apartment.  The room was well decorated and comfortable, and the whole apartment was modern.  It was down a quiet alleyway but walkable to everything in town and had a wonderful patio to sit out for your morning coffee.  Most importantly for us, the wifi was excellent, which allowed us to do some online teaching and recuperate some of the costs for the month.  We paid about $23/night.

**Did** - The town itself is a great place to relax.  Great food, spas everywhere, and yoga studios if you're into that sort of thing.  Though it will be more expensive than most of Indonesia.  We went to the [**Sacred Monkey Forest**](https://imgur.com/a/f3TxsGJ) which is a great day excursion if you aren't too afraid of primates jumping all over you.  We also rented a bike for a day to go to the [**Tegallalang Rice Terraces**](https://imgur.com/a/nZc6koM) which are great to walk around in (Even though I strongly disagree with the donation system where you pay tehe farmers) and the **Gunung Kawi** water temple which has some amazing statues cut into the surrounding hillside.  Both highly enjoyable excursions.  In town, [**Bali Buda**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d1182606-Reviews-Bali_Buda-Ubud_Bali.html) has good smoothie bowls and [**Mama's Warung**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d2400754-Reviews-Mama_s_Warung-Ubud_Bali.html) has a really good, cheap [nasi campur](https://imgur.com/nok2bIh).  We also got an excellent $8 massage at [**Starchild Spa**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297701-d9466026-Reviews-Starchild_Bali-Ubud_Bali.html) (but had to make an appointment first).  Finally, there was this completely random streetwear shop on the way to the rice terraces that I could have easy spent $100 at, but ended up with just two great t-shirts.  The location is approxiamtely [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Erodik/@-8.4711272,115.2682727,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x6de228c5a14b62dc!8m2!3d-8.4517425!4d115.2794981).

****

***Overall***

**Rating** - 5/5

Loved it.  Definitely amongst the top of my countries I have visited.

**Affordability** - 4/5

Food and accommodation are very cheap.  Less than $3 for a lot of meals, and under $15 for private rooms.  For the most part, excursions are cheap as well.  However, it does get a bit pricey to go from one place to another, as it is an island country and you need to take boats/flights.  I would say that not including international flights, I spent about $800-$900 total for the month.
 
**Ease of Travel** - 3.5/5

English is fairly good everywhere.  One really annoying thing is the airline credit card problem.  For some reason, none of the Indonesian airlines will accept European or American credit cards for payment.  We tried every work around we could, but to no avail.  That means we had no way of paying for flights, and therefore no way of buying them.  We had to use travel agents, which turned out to be especially tricky when on the small islands.  I even had to resort to my 1990s trick of just going to the aiport to actually buy a ticket once.

**Excursions** - 5/5

From the cultural scenes of Muslim and Hindu landmarks, to the old Buddhist temples, to the amazing reefs and underwater ecosystems, to the active volcanos, this place has something for everyone.

**Food** - 4.5/5

I am a bit of a street food connoisseur and I really enjoyed the offerings here.  I'll list a couple for you to try.  **Gudeg** is a specialty of Jogja - stewed jackfruit in coconut milk.  Very interesting, sweet almost smoky (?) flavor  It's a must try, but not a must like. **Mie Ayam** is a chicken and noodle soup that you can find for cheap on almost any street corner.  Small bite, but usually very tasty (very soy based).  **Bakso** are meatballs that generally accompany the Mie Ayam that I cannot say I was a big fan of.  **Sate Ayam**, which I'm sure you've had before, is peanut sauce covered chicken on a stick.  Really nice, especially when it's hot and fresh.  **Beef Rendang** is arguably the national dish, a spicy dark red beef dish that I fell in love with.  **Nasi Campur** is a standard rice plate that changes from every restaurant.  Usually some rice, tempeh, meat, vegetables, and sambal (hot sauce).  Great value for cheap lunch.  **Tempeh and Tofu** are two soy based products that are both really nice, especially if you can find them with a tomato sauce.

****

And that was our trip in Indonesia...but really just Bali and Lombok.  Like I said at the beginning, there are a ton of places I would love to go when I go back.  For example, we didn't get a chance to get to the top of any of the three volcanos (Rinjani on Lombok and Bromo / Ijen on East Java) that we had thought about.  From what I've hear, those are amazing - just nott he right time of the eyar for us.  I would also love to check out the Raja Ampat islands and Flores / Komodo.

I hope this is helpful to someone down the line.  As always, if you have any questions, comment or PM!

143,Eva Air (+ other Asian airlines) Hand Luggage: Do they actually weigh carry on luggage?,1,bqb88t,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bqb88t/eva_air_other_asian_airlines_hand_luggage_do_they/,14,1558256860.0,"Does anyone have any experience flying with Eva Air?

I have traveled internationally/transcontinentally quite a bit, and I have never seen an airline weigh hand luggage so maybe I'm fine? Or maybe Asian airlines weigh hand luggage (I've never used a non-American or non-European airline). 

During my trip, I'm also taking Air Asia, VietJet Air, Scoot, and China Airlines so if anyone has experience with these flights I have the same question!","['I’ve flown Eva early this year and they did not weigh my roller.

Some friends of mine in college (they're kenyan nationals studying in the usa, i'm an american born citizen) planned a decent ahead for a trip to paris/barcelona during spring break (march 25th to 29th for them) and got all their ducks in a row, mostly importantly **they started the visa application process for france very early** (14 days before the flight, when the visa people themselves said they only need ""at least"" 5 days). In particular the visa agent completely failed to request any kind of health insurance information initially, didn't mention it, then several days later came back saying it was required, which delayed the process by a lot.

&#x200B;

**The flight was supposed to be YESTERDAY and the visas STILL have not arrived**, and my friends can't even get any worthwhile information on when they'll get their passports back, they're being held hostage. So they essentially cannot leave the country.

&#x200B;

So, me thinking ahead while booking tickets before all this visa situation happened, i saw an ad for **trip mate travel insurance**, thinking it was comprehensive since on the website where we bought the tickets stated ""covers cancellation for any reason"", turns out any reason is pretty rare circumstances such as serious injury or a terrorist attack. Trip mate has a long list of people with very legitimate claims being denied for various bullshit reasons. Visas being held hostage isn't even considered claimable. Student universe just directs them to trip mate so they're not useful

&#x200B;

**is there any avenue by which they can plead to someone's humanity to get some (let alone all) of their money back? Even flight credits?** Like, should they contact the airline directly? Try to talk to a higher up at trip mate? Insist on student universe? They were saving up for many months for this trip, but now they're out a trip and out $466 per person because of some shitty visa processing.

I want to keep my trip a little open ended, so I bought a one way ticket and I'll buy the return when I want to go back.

I've recently read about the possibility that if you have a one way ticket, they might think you're trying to illegally immigrate, and turn you back. From what I've read, it's very rare that the Thai authorities themselves do, but the airline would be burdened with the cost of sending you back, so to be safe they sometimes might check.

So I'm trying to figure out what to do. I've read a bunch of threads here and elsewhere, some people saying they had no trouble at all, and others saying they've been checked. It seems like a common strategy is to buy a cheap AirAsia ticket to a neighboring country that you plan on probably not using. Other people have talked about having a hotel reservation in another country. It seems like the consensus is that over land onward travel (i.e., bus) tickets don't satisfy them.

It also seems like enforcement rates of this stuff may have changed in the past few years, so some of the forums/etc advice online can't be trusted totally.

To be honest I'm confused. Can this all just be solved by getting a single-entry visa? [Looking at the Thai embassy website](http://thaiembdc.org/visas/), it's not really clear to me...

can anyone tell me recent experiences that might help make my decision? Thanks in advance.

edit: I'm flying Qatar Airways, since that might be important. I've found a few links online saying that they have checked in the past.

edit2: in case this can help anyone in the future, I briefly looked into flyonward.com, but threads like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/6dx2za/anyone_here_ever_use_the_flyonwardcom_service/) and others indicate that it's probably a scam at this point, so it wasn't worth risking to save a few bucks.

TL;DR: Need a way to book a flight over a year in advanced.

I'm in need of some help here.  Let me explain..

I'm an American in the process of applying for a student visa to Italy.  My course will last one year, starting in late June of this year.

One of the visa requirements is a ""confirmed flight reservation for a round trip"".  My issue is that every airline and booking site that I've visited will not allow you to book a plane ticket over a year in advanced.  So if I had to book my plane ticket today, I would be departing for Italy in June of this year, to start my course, then returning in April of 2017, which is problematic seeing as how my course will end in June of next year.  Also, I imagine that scheduling to leave two months before my course is officially finished would look suspicious to the consular official who is processing my visa request, and I don't want to risk having my visa denied.

I contacted the consulate and they told me that I must book the ticket through a travel agency.  I contacted a travel agency and they referred me to some sort of online visa/passport assistance company, who does not offer any service that can help my situation.

I have my visa appointment at the Italian consulate scheduled for May 2nd, in two weeks, so I need to book this plane ticket before then.  I feel like this reservation is kind of impossible given the timeline of everything.

I just have some questions about India.

1) I land in Mumbai at midnight and will take a pre-paid taxi to a hotel that I've pre-booked for one night. How much should the taxi cost? Are there any fake pre-paid taxi stands?

2) I will be applying for the tourist visa very soon. They want to see an itinerary. Can anyone show me a sample of an itinerary format or anything that they need?

3) I want to apply for a visa that will allow me to leave India, visit Nepal for a couple of weeks, then re-enter India (rather than waiting the standard 2 months to re-enter). Do you have any advice about this?

3) I have a one-way ticket, which could technically result in me being denied entry into the country. Can anyone comment on entering India with a one-way ticket? Should I tell them that I plan to leave the country via land in China or something?

4) I want to scuba-dive after India. The cheapest option I've found so far is taking Air Asia from KolKata to Bangkok, then diving in Koh Tao. Does anyone know of other airlines or destinations for this?

5) I'm flying from Edmonton to Munich to Mumbai. Do I need to get my checked luggage and re-check it anywhere?

6) Are there any Canadian banks that offer particularly low fees for pulling money out of ATMs in India?

7) I plan to bring a tonne of passport copies. Do I need passport photos for anything?

8) How do I get rid of touts?

9) Are bedbugs a concern anywhere, or is it pretty rare?

10) I'm waiting for my American Express card to arrive in the mail so that I can book trains directly from the main website. Can I cancel them without any extra fees within 24h?

11) Are all crimes mostly just crimes of opportunity (for example, someone grabbing a camera out of a person's hand), or will I have to worry about being robbed with a weapon anywhere? 

12) **Inspiration?** I'm looking for books, movies, documentaries, and anything that will help to prepare me a little bit!

They\'re annoying but harmless.\n\nAlso, even at midnight the traffic will suck.  I was in Navi Mumbai and it took about two hours to get to my hotel after landing at 10pm.\n\n2) I was in Mumbai on a business trip so I didn\'t have that requirement, can\'t help you there.\n\n3) Call the consulate.\n\n3) Call the consulate.\n\n4) Koh Tao is definitely a great option.

Recently, we have loved visiting Lviv, Krakow, Zagreb, Split, Vilnius... We have also done Budapest, Prague, and the usual Central/Western European cities (Vienna, Berlin, Munich, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, etc.).

For this trip, we are thinking of Romania...Any other ideas? We are using airline miles so our last minute planning shouldn't be too problematic. We have about 10 days or so to travel.

We enjoy more unique, less touristy destinations that tend to be more affordable than Western Europe. We are fairly adventurous and active.

goo.gl/FjN6An

*I understand that the ""About"" section says you don't respond directly to complaints on Facebook, but after working through the official channels and receiving either no response or an offensively inadequate one, I've been left with little recourse but to turn to social media. I'm hopeful that someone at American/US Airways will read this and have the will and means to rectify my problem. I'm a frequent traveler. I've flown your airlines before and would like to be able to do so again in the future, but as it stands you're on the edge of losing a customer (and my family, friends, etc.). I assume I'm going to hit the character limit, so please continue to the comments where I'll add the complete story.

I was to travel on July 14 from PIT to BRU with a layover in PHL. I arrived at PIT several hours early and checked a bag. At the initial check-in desk, I was informed that my PIT-PHL flight had been canceled, but that passengers from that flight who had arrived early were being rebooked on another, earlier flight to PHL. I proceeded to the gate and boarded the plane.

Once we were in the air, the captain announced that our flight time would be about 42 minutes and that the weather in New York was rainy. You may recall that we were supposed to be flying to Philadelphia. My ticket said Philadelphia. The flight crew seemed to be unaware that a number of passengers had been rebooked to this flight and were under the impression that we were going to Philadelphia. After much anxiety and confusion, we were informed that we were in fact flying to New York's LaGuardia airport where we would deboard, the crew would swap with a new crew, we would reboard and depart for Philadelphia where we would all connect to our next flight.

At LGA, we got off the plane and walked across the tarmac to the terminal. An announcement was made that the crew swap and safety check would take ""10-20 minutes"" at which point we could get back on the plane and depart for PHL. After around 20 minutes, an announcement was made that a member of the crew for the LGA-PH leg of the fight was running ""10-15 minutes"" late and that upon his arrival, we would board and take off for Philadelphia. 25-30 minutes later, we were informed that the crew member (the ""first mate"" we were told) was still running late, but would arrive soon. Finally, after well over an hour had passed, the US Airways staff informed us that many passengers would miss our connections in PHL. We were to be called by destination up to the desk for rebooking or redirection to Special Services. By the time my destination was called, much more time had passed and several destinations' passengers had been routed to Special Services. I, too, was sent upstairs. I inquired about my bag, but was assured that it was being taken off the plane and would accompany me when I made arrangements for a rebooked flight to Brussels.

The line at special services was almost unimaginable long and despite the staff there working feverishly, it moved only a few feet in the 45 minutes or so I stood there. Another passenger suggested that we call US Airways' toll-free number and try to get help that way. I did so and eventually spoke with an agent. Initially, her best suggestion was that I find somewhere to stay for the night and ""start over tomorrow."" She offered a few flights/connections that would have me arriving in Brussels at least a day and a half behind schedule. I asked her to try and find a better solution, as that one was unworkable to me. I was placed on hold and when she returned, she had a seat for me on a British Airways flight to London (LHR) which would then connect to BRU, getting me there in the evening of the 15th. I'd miss a day of my conference, but that was apparently the best possible solution.

That flight, however, was departing from JFK. The agent informed me that getting from LGA to JFK was my problem, she suggested a cab (at 5pm in New York City) at my expense. I reluctantly accepted and ran to the baggage desk to retrieve my luggage. There, the agent informed me that my bag was left on the plane and was in the air on its way to Philadelphia. After begging for help, he let me know that the best thing I could do was to wait until I arrived in Brussels and file a claim there, whereupon my baggage could be sent behind me and would arrive ""in a day or two."" Again, left with nothing but bad options, I left for JFK.

A $40 rush-hour cab ride later, I get to JFK, have time for a bite to eat, and board my BA flight to LHR. Lightning prevents refueling for 2 1/2 hours, but the flight is otherwise unremarkable. I land at LHR 22 minutes before the gates are to close on my connecting flight. After going through London's unimaginably efficient security, I run through the airport and get to my gate as the agent is closing the door.

 When I arrive in Brussels, I have obviously missed my prepaid, non-refundable train to the conference. I had to rent a car, as waiting for the next train would cost me the better part of another day and would cost as much as a car anyhow due to the sliding scale of fees.

The baggage agent at BRU confirmed that my bag was in Philadelphia. I filled out some paperwork and he assured me that it would be on the next flight out of Philadelphia and a courier would deliver it from the airport to my hotel in Reims, France, in a day or two. I was also informed that since I had been rebooked on a British Airways flight, my bag was now British Airways' problem and not US Airways (who lost it). The documentation assured me that some 90%+ of delayed or misrouted bags are reunited with passengers within 72 hours. Four days later, a message is left for me at my hotel saying that my bag wouldn't have gotten to me in time (before I left that hotel to continue my trip and then come home) so BA was shipping it to my home, where it would arrive in a day or two.

This bag had all of my clothing, including the suits I was to wear to my professional conference where formal dress is expected. I had been forced to attend in the clothing on my back (a tee shirt and casual pants) thus far. I had already been washing my only pair of underwear and socks as well as my two tee shirts in the hotel sink every night, but confirmation that I'd never get my clothing in Europe meant I'd have to present my research the next day in a tee shirt instead of a suit. I went into town and spent what little money I had on the closest thing I could get to formal attire and some socks and underwear (thank goodness for H&M).

I returned home on July 23. I contacted US Airways via the online complaints/comments form. I called BA on the 24th to inquire about my bag, which you may have guessed never got to my house. The agent said it ""looks like it's at CDG."" I was assured that it would be flown back to PIT ""in a day or two"" where a courier would deliver it to my home. That was two weeks ago.

I received an email back from US Airways re: my complaint form which said, essentially, that my experience was unfortunate, US Airways staff obviously did not do what they should have done, but managed to blame the entire debacle on the weather and, thus, denied any responsibility in the matter.

 This is simply unconscionable to me. I am hopeful that this response does not represent US Airways' position and policy in a case like this and I am likewise hopeful that someone from US Airways will contact me to resolve this in a more reasonable manner.

Thank you for your time.*

He lamented that the agent in Pittsburgh told me she wass putting me on a flight to PHL and did not tell me I was flying to LGA.

He conceded that had the crew member been on time, I\'d have made my initial connection, not had to pay for the cab, and not missed my train in Brussels (requiring me to rent a car). He also conceded that had the original rep told me I was flying into LGA and not PHL, that I would have had the information to weigh my other options and to discuss/consider the potential impact of the weather on my connections. For example, at that time I probably could have driven my car to PHL and made my connection. However, despite the fact that these were ""customer service issues"" he still declared the weather as the sole cause of everything that went wrong, thus absolving US Airways of any responsibility. He said that if the crew member at LGA was late for any reason other than the weather, I would be due compensation, but that he ***assumes*** he was late due to the weather. He said ""if he was late for any other reason, there would be a note here (on his computer re: that flight)."" I asked if there would be a note if he was late due to weather/another flight being delayed. He said that yes, there would be. I asked if there was a note to that effect, and he said ""no."" So he\'s *assuming*, with no information to support it, that it was weather and, conveniently, that assumption absolves US Airways of any responsibility.

Our customers deserve a pleasurable experience each and every time they fly with us, and I am sorry this trip did not meet your expectations.

I was told I was on ""a Flight to Philadelphia,"" not ""a flight to New York, then Philadelphia."" I was also told to ""hurry straight to the gate"" because said flight was scheduled to leave very soon.]* Because of your continued concern, I was able to confirm that the pilot scheduled for the continuation of US 3979 back to Philadelphia was not available because of his late arrival in to New York and FAA mandated crew rest requirements. *[Note: I specifically asked about this no less than 4 times during our hour-long phone conversation and he assured me that there was no information available.]*\n\nI understand how frustrating this must have been.

I fully appreciate your desire to get to Europe as quickly as possible but the final decision on accepting or rejecting an offered alternative departure schedule is made by the passenger.

I was told when I arrived at PIT that the flight was canceled but that they would get me on another and I\'d make my connections, so I frankly didn\'t care to ask why. The delay/cancellation in New York (LGA-PHL) was allegedly because a crew member was running late. Multiple times we were explicitly told that he was ""running late"" and was ""on his way,"" never was this qualified with anything having to do with the weather. FWIW, it was 85-90 degrees and sunny in New York, so any weather issue certainly wasn\'t there. Only when we sat on the runway at JFK (JFK-LHR flight) several hours later and lightning prevented refueling was the weather ever mentioned as affecting my travel. I made that connection (LHR-BRU) so the weather didn\'t impact my trip other than being hot and bored on the runway for a while.

Okay so I have a $500 air fare credit with American Airlines (One World) that is burning a hole in my pocket. I really want to go to South America and visit 2 cities while I am down there. I would like to keep air fare under $500 but if it is an awesome itinerary I would pay a little on top of the credit. Here are the details:

* I would be flying out of PHL, EWR, or JFK depending on where the best deal is.
* Looking for about a 7 day trip
* Travel would be in November or December of 2016 (Excluding US Holidays) or January of 2017
* I would most likely be traveling with my cousin and we are both 23 year old guys who have limited international travel experience. (I have been to Colombia and Canada.)
* We would be staying in Hostels when we are down there. My budget for the 6-7 days needs to stay under $500 as well.

I am looking to you guys for advice/experience on the best cities to visit within these parameters. I have done a lot of google flights searching and came up with two ideas already. Maybe I could get some opinions on them.

1) JFK--> MDE --> CTG --> JFK

* This itinerary is under $400 for airfare and would allow me to check out two really cool cities in Colombia. While I have been to Bogota, I have not been to Medellin or Cartagena and hear they are awesome places. Plus hostels there are really cheap.

2)JFK --> UIO --> SCY --> UIO -->JFK

* This itinerary is at a little over $600. ($472 with OneWorld for JFK to Quito RT and then $150 out of pocket for Quito to Galapagos Islands RT). We could spend a couple nights in Quito and then a couple nights in the Galapagos. I have a feeling the Galapagos are pretty expensive once you are there activity wise, but private room hostels are $40/night.

168,Best Way to get Reimbursed for Airline Maintenance Delays,1,a7y2mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/a7y2mq/best_way_to_get_reimbursed_for_airline/,13,1545342423.0,"
TL;DR best way to get compensation for delayed-for-maintenance flights on 3 separate airlines.

Long Story:

Not to say that someone else hasn’t had worse luck and worse flight delays, but my most recent trip was chalk full of delays on different airlines and while I’m totally fine now that I’m home, I’m still annoyed. I’m looking for advice on the best way to get reimbursement from each airline. Currently, I am planning on just going through each airline’s customer service phone line, but if there’s any other recommendations for what I should do, I’d love to hear them.

All of this flying is in the US

Flight 1: just me affected, delta airlines, got on flight, engine wouldn’t start, deplaned after an hour, flight delayed a total of 3ish hours, normal connecting flight would have been missed so they rebooked me to a different airport where I eventually made it to my destination 5 hours after us should have, 5 hours of work missed, somewhat important meeting missed.

Flight 2: my in-laws flight was delayed/cancelled(not sure) due to maintenance, American Airlines, AA rebooked them on a later flight causing them to miss a paint and sip class that I paid for, in-laws have no interest in paying me back but (if it’s easy enough) they’ll go through the reimbursement process for the paint class and give me the reimbursement, I know it’s only $60 but I’d rather not eat that

Flight 3: return trip home for me and wife, United Airlines, flight delayed due to maintenance (incoming flight landed but there was an issue so they lazily (yes I’m most upset about this flight) went and grabbed another plane from the hangar), flight was delayed about 1hr and 15min which essentially ate up all of our layover time at the next airport and we ran about a mile (not exaggerating) through the airport and made it to our connecting flight literally as the gate agent was walking away to shut the door, the whole plane waited just for us which was really nice but if we would have been 30 seconds later the doors would have been closed. Yes we made this connecting flight but I’m pissed about me and my wife having to run through the airport to barely make the flight

So 3 different airlines, 3 different situations, what’s my best options here? Thanks in advance for the suggestions.

Side note on Flight 1: Delta overbooked the flight by 2 people and offered 2 $800 dollar Amazon gift cards for people to take a later flight, guess who wasn’t smart enough to take that offer? Me and 100 other people :(","[""Flight #1: Read Delta's Terms and Conditions for delayed flights, [it's Rule #19 here.](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract-of-carriage-dom-2NOV18.pdf) They did everything they're legally responsible for.\n\nFlight #2: No airline will pay for a missed Paint & Sip class.\n\nFlight #3: No airline will pay for you having to run in an airport."", 'There’s no regulation in the US that you could lean on as a passenger; the best way is to bitch to the airlines on social media, email and phone and hope they’ll give you something. ', 'What’s a paint and sip class?', '>> (incoming flight landed but there was an issue so they lazily (yes I’m most upset about this flight) went and grabbed another plane from the hangar)\n\nSo why were they ""lazy""? They have an aircraft that\'s gone u/s on its incoming flight so, rightly, they won\'t let it go out again until the problem\'s solved. In this instance the quickest solution was replace rather than repair - the repair process, including diagnosing the fault & obtaining & fitting any parts required could well have taken a lot longer.\n\nJust think yourself lucky that they had a replacement aircraft available! We had a 5-hour delay with American earlier this year because our perfectly-serviceable aircraft was taken as a replacement for one which had developed a fault. On the whole I\'d rather suffer a delay than fly in a potentially unsafe plane.', ""The best way to get compensated is a travel credit card. Most cards offer 4-6 hour delay coverage that pays out 500 dollars. I understand it wouldn't apply in your case but it's a tool every traveller should have."", 'I’ve dealt with addressing these issues for 16 years. I disagree with many of the comments here. As far as Delta goes, you merely call corporate customer care, or file an official complaint [here](https://www.delta.com/contactus/commentComplaint). When you experience major maintenance delays, Delta typically will offer you something like a credit towards your next flight purchase. It’s not going to be equal to your lost wages and missed meeting or business opportunity. It’s  simply meant to be a gesture of apology. ', ""You tell me things I don't want to hear, but I know you're right. Is it even worth my time calling the customer service lines?"", 'You take a shot everytime you dip your paint brush into a different color paint.\n\n\n\n\nOk, I kid.', 'Essentially you go to a place where they teach you how to paint something. This place provides the paint, canvas, brushes, smock, etc but you still have to pay for the drinks.', ""My issue wasn't with them changing planes, it was with the speed at which the planes were switched. I totally understand we were super lucky to actually have a replacement plane; I just didn't feel like they cared to do the plane switch expediently. And yes I know the saying wouldn't you rather have it done right than fast, but it was less of feeling them doing it right and more of a feeling of a lackadaisical operation.\n\nI'm sorry to hear of your delay earlier this year, that sounds like nightmare :( But same, I guess maybe next time we'll opt to miss the connecting flight rather than get stressed out running through an airport."", ""No, but if it makes you feel better to try to get something that you're not entitled to, go for it."", ""That's actually the Paint and Slip class."", ""What may have seemed to you like a slow process in getting a replacement aircraft was probably done as quickly as they could. \n\nIn our case, the delayed flight was PHL-MAN. In the other direction, or on an EU airline, we'd have been eligible for €600 compensation under EU261; as it was, we got nothing (well, a lot of AAdvantage miles which we'll probably never use). So what. . . stuff happens!""]"

We are both about 30 years old typical Americans with backpacking experience. This has been a plan/dream we have had for a couple years... We plan to stay in most destinations 3-10 days. We have a ton of airline miles and hotel points. Otherwise we will be staying in hostels, airbnbs or other cheap accommodations.

Anyhow, here's [the current trip plan](http://i.imgur.com/2twVY5i.jpg) (always changing).

TY!","[""A slightly altered sequence for you to consider. Of course, you can cut or add as you like, but this sequence makes more sense to me. Japan and Korea are a bit awkward for climate but the rest aren't too bad as long as you arrive in India after the monsoon.

Often, I think, long-term itineraries are only trouble: you have expectations regarding what a certain city is going be like, you may stay longer in an area you dislike, shorter in an area you turn out to love, never make it to places which aren't mentioned, etc. (of course, that's only if you're a robot and don't actually do what you want to do). I see you mostly only have large cities listed - some of your most enjoyable experiences may be outside of the city, however, I'm sure you'll be doing lots of day trips to more rural areas. As for recommendations, I suggest considering word-of-mouth, the best way to find out about charming towns, great hostels, tasty food, etc.. My suggestion is not keep a strict itinerary, there are so many great places in India (Kerala, the East?), Vietnam (Sapa area, Dalat?) Colombia (San Gil, Salento?), Peru (Amazon?), New Zealand (Milford Sound, Nelson?) that you haven't listed. All in all, looks like a great trip, and I'm sure you've done a lot of research and hard work in order to put together such an itinerary. "", ""I'll add some comments when I get back to the PC.

Much of the advise has been to take a north to south or south to north route to help save money in Europe. From your outline, you seem to zig zag all over the place. Are you visiting certain places due an event? If you don't mind, I would suggest going from Iceland into Finland then into Eastern Europe then into Turkey. May I siggest even Isreal or Jordan when visiting Turkey? After Turkey, you can go into med. Europe i.e Greece and south of France then to Spain and Morocco. You can leave Europe from Lisbon. This is just a suggestion. But your trip looks awesome! I like that you broke up your outline via weeks. \nP.s. Visit Sri lanka - beaches are awesome and it wouldn't be as crowded like in India! \nHave Fun!!!!!  "", ""You are going to be exhausted! Consider getting an Airbnb apartment to chill out at for a week or two in some of the big cities along the way.

I also like having a plan for those times when I don't know what to do or am just plain too lazy while on the road to go and do something.

Also it will be cool to see Iceland. :)  The three major cities that you've listed. I've already been to and there's nowhere nearby that I want to go that badly. "", "">I'm guessing that you're speaking of Sri Lanka for one of those? \n\nNo. Note my flair :) You have managed to fly straight past Australia between India, New Zealand and Indonesia. Apart from other considerations it is a darn sight cheaper to use SE Asian and Australian low cost carriers via us to do that. \n\nI don't think it is too rushed, because a lot depends on how you arrange flights and links between places. However, I think you need to sit down with a globe in front of you and look at the route, then consider transport methods between them.\n\nYou said you are leaving in Boston summer. I presume that is July or August. Spend some time looking at the climate for each of your preferred locations. For example, your present schedule has you dipping into Iberia and Morocco mid-summer then heading to the chilly north of Europe. I'd reverse that.\n\nSimilarly, look at other climates. You don't want to be equatorial in the monsoons or hurricane/cyclone season, or in the far north or far south in their respective winters. You will need to make some compromises to marry your logical transportation route with climate, but it can be done.\n\nA couple of other tips. Once I know my basic plan I start watching the airlines servicing my chosen routes for discount specials. Once I have bought the air tickets I always book accommodation for the first night off the plane. I don't want to be searching for a hotel when I'm jet-lagged and weary. I may leave later accommodation open depending on the plan, but I always book that first night. I also make no plans for that day to let me get over jet-lag.\n\nLook for the individual best transport method to suit you in each location. For example, in Europe the French leaseback car system is brilliant for long rentals of six weeks or more. Over most of Europe the rail system is excellent and there are lots of low cost air carriers but make sure you understand their rules. In the sub-continent the rail system is good but a car with driver is also cheap and can be better for local tours. Each country is uniquely different, leading to different methods of travel and different choices of accommodation.\n\nI have time on my hands. I'll play around with that itinerary. Are the listed places 'must-sees' or flexible?\n\n"", ""I just spent a month in Sri Lanka, prior to coming back to India. I had a wonderful time there. It's a great country and I'd recommend it to anyone. If you're rushed for time, you can a lot in a relatively short time period due to its size. "", ""I've been to Hyderabad, Delhi, and Agra. I'm 25, female, and very blonde hair / pale skin. The attention in India can tire you out after a while. I was always with my boyfriend and we didn't have any real trouble though. \n\nExpect people to want to take pictures with the two of you. Kids will kind of swarm you and they all want to practice their English. This mostly happens if you stop to sit down on a bench or to look at a map. If you look busy, people will generally not want to bother you. \n\nAn example is that we were at the Red Fort in Delhi and stopped to sit. A few guys came up and asked for a photo. They wanted pics of them shaking my boyfriends hand and stuff. Then a queue of a few more people formed who also wanted to pictures. You kind of have to know when to cut it off before it gets out of hand. I got the impression that the men had a lot of respect for my boyfriend and as a result did not bother me. \n\nWe also rode the rather crowded metro. There is a women's only car on each train, but we didn't use it because we didn't want to split up. It was jammed pack, but people kept offering me their seats. Obviously in that situation there is the potential for someone to try to brush against you or something, but it didn't happen to me. \n\nIf you're in a touristy area with lots of rickshaws, they will all try to convince you relentlessly to get a ride from them. \n\nSo, like I said, it can be really tiring. I think if you are willing to be firm with people you should be fine though. I generally wore long pants and a tee shirt and I don't think people had a problem with how I was dressed. ""]"

I was contacted about the change, and was offered three options: a full refund, a rebooking to the new itinerary with overnight layovers out of IAD, or a booking out of DCA that more closely matched our original itinerary.  

I chose to be rebooked out of DCA.  However, this itinerary is $300 cheaper that what we initially booked, and it will now cost me about $200 more in taxi for the flight out of a cheaper, less convenient airport.

I contacted the resort we booked through and was told there was nothing they could do since a full airfare refund was offered (understandable on their part).

They pushed up our depature flight out of DFW from early am to late the night before and they bumped us to the morning flight from MIA>SXM.  It actually got us to the beach earlier but it required us to spend the night in MIA during the layover (it was only like a 6 hour layover because it was such a late flight and such an early am flight) but we still had to get a cheap airport hotel that night.  They just emailed me about the change and didn't give me any options about it, but that could be because we booked with miles.  I told them about the hotel and asked for some money to cover the hotel, but they said they couldn't do anything until after the flight.  So after the flight I filled out a complaint and told them I spent like 120 on a hotel and they actually gave me a credit for $200 for my next flight with AA.  So if you can't make anything else work I'd just fill out the customer complaint when you get back from the trip and ask them for help with the extra costs from the flight change.

178,Advice on international hidden-city ticketing scenario,1,6jup2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6jup2e/advice_on_international_hiddencity_ticketing/,12,1498617036.0,"I have a somewhat crazy travel plan due to planning a vacation immediately after someone else's destination wedding. I am a US citizen living in Raleigh. The wedding is in San Francisco, my vacation is in London. I will already be in San Francisco when the wedding starts for business reasons on a previously booked one-way ticket. My car would be left at the Raleigh airport.

I can save a good deal of money by booking a multi-city ticket SFO->London (British Airways), then London->Washington, DC flight that connects through Raleigh (American Airlines), with the intention of getting off in Raleigh.

My plan would be to check all of my luggage on the return trip and not bring a carryon. Since Raleigh would be the first port of entry into the US, I would retrieve my checked bag to go through customs. Then I would just leave the airport instead of proceeding to the DC flight.

Presumeably American Airlines would know I never boarded the flight to DC once I didn't get on the plane with my ticket never being scanned, but is there any way, logistically, this plan wouldn't work? Any barriers that would get me caught before leaving the airport?

Assuming my plan would work logistically, does anyone have experience with the legal and/or civil consequences  of skipping only the end-leg of return trip hidden city ticket with American Airlines in particular?

Is there anything wrong with this plan I'm not thinking of?

Thanks!

American here soon to be heading abroad for the first time with a friend. All the questions will be bolded if you'd like to skip over. The trip is 9 days total and consists of these 3 cities-

Paris 3 nights

Amsterdam 4 nights

Copenhagen 2 nights

We'll be leaving for the EU out of Newark International (EWR) at the end of May with Level Airline. Understandably, the budget airline gets a bad rap. But the price one-way was too tempting to pass up for us college students. However, I've read rather concerning reviews about them [cancelling flights last minute](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d12665310-r667298362-LEVEL-World.html?m=19905). Other reviews have suggested [they're fine](https://johnnyafrica.com/level-airlines-review-newark-paris/). This conflicting information has been worrying me enough to consider rebooking, but the alternatives flying out of Newark are a fortune. I would be okay with switching flights at the more affordable JFK if it means avoiding such a disaster. Given everything else is booked/paid for, this is my top concern. If anyone on here has flown with them, specifically on the EWR-ORY route advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Are flight cancellations with LEVEL/budget airlines common?** **Should we fly out of JFK instead on a more reliable airline?**

Paris:

When we do land we'll be staying at an AirBnB in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. I understand this is the Eastern part of the city, a couple hours walk from the Champ de Mars/other touristy areas. We're both young and fit so walking isn't a concern, but Menilmontant is quite a ways from some of the places we'd like to visit. I've read the neighboorhood has a ""Brooklyn""/Grungy vibe. This doesn't concern me too much, but I certainly don't want to be caught up in any of the sketchier parts of the city. I'm familiar with general big city safety precautions, but any insight on this area would be helpful.

**Is the 20th arrondissement safe for tourists to stay? Are the Yellow Vest protests anything to be worried about?**

Amsterdam:

We'll be taking the train in from The Gare du Nord. Looking forward to the ride through the French countryside

and Belgium! No burning questions here but any general advice is welcome. And yes, I'll do my best to avoid being hit by bicycles :)

Copenhagen:

Added this beautiful city to finish our trip. We would like to stop in Malmö for a few hours so my friend can get another glimpse of Sweden. Obviously, we're only here a couple nights so time is of the essence.

**Is Malmö worth a visit for only 2 nights in Copenhagen? How much of my spending money should be cash?**

For the second question I'll provide a budget of roughly $1000. I can provide more details if need be. This isn't an elaborate itenrary but I'd like to keep it relatively short. Any additional pointers are welcome. We are unbelievably excited, but just a tad nervous for our first visit to the mainland. Thank you everyone!

&#x200B;

Update: Trip completed. It was absolutely wonderful I really had nothing to worry about. Thank you all for the kind advice, we tried to squeeze in as much as we could. Would go back in a heartbeat :)","['Because I stayed in Montparnasse, I\'m not too knowledgeable regarding the 20th. And I\'ve never been to Copenhagen.\n\nBut for Amsterdam, I can give some tips!

I dunno if that\'s a thing you\'d like but I remember going there not expecting much and coming out absolutely loving it. \n\nFor sites, you can walk through Vondelpark. The Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum are right next to each other. You can also walk up and down the Red Light District.

Turns out, it\'s a really nice area where people just casually walk around going into different shops and bars. Kids even walk around!\n\nAlso, if you\'re up for it, rent a bicycle and take it out to Marken and stroll around there. I hate calling a place ""simple"" just because it doesn\'t have the bustle of a big city, but, for a lack of better terms, Marken is a ""simpler"" place. It\'s a quaint little village where, at least from what I could tell, they\'re mostly self sufficient. On the way there, there\'s this family farm that sells ice cream.

180,Am I the only one here that has never had a problem with United?,1,3k9ynx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3k9ynx/am_i_the_only_one_here_that_has_never_had_a/,12,1441851866.0,"Type ""United"" into the search bar and the only thing you'll find are posts complaining about bad experiences with them, one going as far as calling them ""Comcast of the Sky"". This comes as a surprise to me seeing as I fly with them several times a year and have always had pleasant experiences. (Well, not pleasant, but no worse than any other US Airline.) 

My home airport is Dayton so going pretty much anywhere requires a connection in Chicago; a major airport for all three big airlines. (United and American in particular.) The two places I go every year are Gunnison/Crested Butte (via Denver) in the winter and Los Angeles in the spring, in addition to other places I may go once every few years. Going to Colorado is always on United and is almost always a breeze. The only time I ever had a problem was when my ORD-DEN flight was delayed by mechanical trouble and I ended up missing my connecting flight. However, upon my arrival in Denver we were met at the gate by a United representative who informed us that we had already been re-booked on the next flight and presented us with a voucher for a free night at a hotel near the airport as well as a $10 meal ticket for each of us.

 Going to Los Angeles in the spring usually involves flying either AA or Delta. Delta has been fine for the most part but flying on American more often than not becomes a complete pain in the ass. I don't think I've ever been on a AA flight out of O'Hare that wasn't delayed and their customer service completely sucks too. On my most recent trip, I flew from Burbank-Phoenix-Chicago-Dayton. In Phoenix, our flight was delayed an hour and-a-half. (Through no fault of AA, apparently someone threw up on the last flight and they had to vacuum the carpets or something.)   By the time we finally boarded, it became clear we were going to miss our flight to Dayton and would have to spend the night in Chicago. Upon landing, I expected a similar procedure as with United in Denver but coming out of the jet-bridge there was no one to be seen. Not even at the gate desk. We had to find our way to a re-booking kiosk and the seemingly thoroughly uninterested rep. on the other side took 30 minutes to get us onto the flight the next day and was ready to hang up before I asked about overnight accommodations. She curtly informed us that she couldn't do anything and we would have to go find a Customer Service staff member inside the airport. It was late at night, so there was no one at the dedicated customer service and most of the gates were empty too. We finally found two gate agents who were stuck there because the flight that was coming into their gate was delayed. (surprise!) We marched up and pretty much demanded that we be put up in a hotel and the agent, who to her credit was very polite and professional, said that she would need to phone her supervisor to approve. He pretty much just said ""yeah whatever, just give it to them"" and we were finally on our way to the hotel. (Whose bus took 45 minutes to pick us up.) 

During the ride, I thought back to people we had met at the re-booking kiosk who had also missed their Dayton flight. They struck me as the type that rarely flew and looked very unsure as to their best course of action. They were at the kiosk when we got there and were still trying to negotiate with the rep. on the phone when we left. I hoped that they too had managed to get into a hotel but thought it was more likely that AA just let them spend the night in the airport.

TL;DR I've never had a bad experience with United, and if you're ever departing from/transferring through O'Hare don't choose American Airlines.","[""So far in 2015, I've flown United about 40 times. I had one significant mechanical delay and one significant weather delay. I, for one, am a happy UA customer. I do get the sense from reading travel forums, news, and social that there's generally more dissatisfaction with UA's customer service than with the others."", ""I think ultimately everyone's perception of each airline will be different based on their experiences.  Some will not have any real problems with United while some will never ever fly them again due to repeated horrible experiences. On top of that, you may have less negative experiences due to you not flying very much compared to say consultants who travel 50+% of the time for work and have weekly repeated flights.  As a result, their sample size would be say at least 15-20 flights a year, if not many more.  That would allow them to see a more comprehensive picture of day to day average performance. \n\nA way to get a more comprehensive view of how an airline is seen by consumers could be to go and look at a variety of social media sources to determine the frequency of complaints regarding each airline.  Even more objective measurement would be to look at airline statistics, such as on time performance, amount of official complaints, cancellation rate of flights, etc.\n\nThat being said, I've noted personally based on what I've seen generally more complaints about United as far as on time performance and customer experiences.  It used to be Delta that was perceived badly.  Two acronyms come to mind: Don't Expect Luggage To Arrive and Doesn't Ever Leave The Airport."", ""I've had problems with them, before but they've always treated me well.  Never had a problem with bags (but I usually carry on).  I have had delays before, but that happens with any airline.  On a delayed ORD-FRA flight last year, missed my connection to Malta.  They put me on Air Malta later that evening.  Just last week I was flying IAH-AMS with a connection to Istanbul, when that flight was delayed they put me on IAH-IST nonstop."", 'Probably', ""People will always find something to complain about. Whether it be the cramped leg room, the food, or fees on Spirit, there will always be something to complain about. I've flown many of the U.S. airlines and I've never had any major problems. I'm a very go-with-the-flow type guy and nothing really gets me all bent out of shape. Minor things happen, but it's all about how you respond. Shit happens.\n\nI've been flying Delta for 15 years and I know some people who absolutely loathe them. I've only had one mishap occur. My flight got delayed 13 hours because a volcano was erupting in Ecuador. They gave us vouchers for a hotel for the night. It was a major inconvenience, but they can't control Mother Nature, so why go all crazy and yell and leave bad reviews?"", ""When I lived in Monterrey, Mexico, I flew back to my hometown San Francisco through Houston on United once every month or two. So a total of 15 or so times. There were a few delays every so often, but nothing ever happened that made me dislike the airline. Customer service was not spectacular, but they were always accommodating, even when I needed to change my flights. I know it isn't an outstanding airline, but in my experience, it isn't as terrible as it is made out to be."", ""I adore United's faulty systems. They overbook every flight and give out free flight vouchers like candy. \n\n\n\nI've gotten four $300-500 vouchers just in the past six months for volunteering to do delayed flights. Got a $400 slip last week for getting on a flight 20min later. Cha ching. "", ""People like to complain. Type in any major airline into the search bar and your going to pull up very similar threads. People don't get on here to rave about how their delta/United/AA flight was on time and uneventful, so all you're ever going to see is complaints, regardless of carrier. "", 'As someone who was primarily sticking with United, due to credit card and racking up points, I have been less enthusiastic lately due to smaller seats on plane, medium customer service (Southwest is much better) and lack of upgrades.  There are tons of empty seats in economy plus and they are not upgrading.  I have had cancelled and delayed flights, my last flight to Thailand I think every leg was delayed, and I have had multiple cancelled flights, call customer service, have to wait on hold for 20 minutes at a time.\n\nIt\'s just less than impressive.  I travel about 25,000 miles a year and about a total of 10 flights a year.  I am not someone who goes online to complain, but it is definitely not worth my ""loyalty.""  I travel to Asia, so it benefits me to use either Star Alliance or oneworld airlines, and I probably will be switching to oneworld next year, based on the past 2 years. ', "">So far in 2015, I've flown United about 40 times.\n\nHoly hell, do you mind if I ask you what you do?"", 'That\'s certainly true for most companies, but I get the feeling that whenever I bring up other airlines in daily conversation the reaction is ""meh"" but if I bring up United people will sit me down and lecture me about how United done fucked up everything.', ""I'm based in San Francisco, doing US outreach for a charity based in the UK. It means I do a lot of SFO-LHR trips and then a lot of domestic travel as well.""]"

The flight was advertised as Qantas airlines. On the way there the trip included Qantas from DCA to LAX, then Qantas from LAX to PPT. On the way back it was Qantas from PPT to LAX, and then Alaskan airlines form LAX to DCA.

I proceeded to purchase the tickets on Kayak which actually went through airfare.com. I didn't realize this until after. I didn't think anything of it. 

First I received a confirmation from Kayak.com that airfare.com is processing my ticket with Qantas airlines. 

Then I got an email from amadeus.net with the Qantas flight information and confirmation numbers to use on checkmytrip.com.

Next I received an email from airfare.com with my confirmation number to use on checkmytrip.com

And then I received a final email from airfare.com that had an itinerary and ticket numbers. This time it said the flights would be American airlines from DCA to LAX, american airlines from LAX to PPT. And on the way back American Airlines from PPT to LAX, and Alaskan Airlines from LAX to DCA.  And why only 3 ticket numbers?

The times of the flight are the same but why am I on an airline I didn't book?

Then I emailed airfare.com and asked how I could select my seats. I was told to contact american airlines directly. 

This lead me to googling airfare.com and there are quite a few horror stories. Most of them are due to the fees involved with changing or canceling flights. However, I am still very worried. 

Tomorrow I am going to call airfare.com and ask them why the airline is not what I booked. Then I am going to call American and Alaskan and confirm my ticket numbers.

187,"Booked a non-refundable round trip ticket months in advance and now want to extend my trip. If I book a new one-way flight home with a different airline and skip my original return, what in your experience is the chance that my fare will be recalculated as a one-way?",0,7xlua2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7xlua2/booked_a_nonrefundable_round_trip_ticket_months/,11,1518675500.0,"I know that you all have probably answered a variation of this question before, but I wanted to see if you had any advice for me with my specifics. I looked through the sidebar and couldn’t quite find what I was looking for. 

I booked a round trip flight with AA/Iberia from the USA to Malaga Spain (layover in Madrid on both legs). It is a nonrefundable ticket. I booked the flight a long time ago, and since then I have had a significant downturn in the amount of work I have to do and a lot of extra unused PTO, and I now have a friend who is living in Spain that would love to meet up if I were able to stay for an additional 5 or 6 days. Looking at the prices, any other flights on the same airline with my same departure flight and a later return date are also MUCH more expensive. That, coupled with what I see is a $750 international change fee for American Airlines and (potentially a change fee for Iberia), makes me think that changing the second half of my flight would be prohibitively expensive.

However, there are some pretty cheap one-way flights that I could book home with other airlines. I was completely excited about this idea of just flying my original flight there and then just buying a new one-way ticket home for a week later, but then I read online about this idea of ""throw-away"" ticketing and how it is against the rules of an airline, and that AA could potentially charge me for not taking the second half and I could lose my miles from them. I had NO idea this was a thing, but now I am worried about my plan to extend my trip...

I have never missed a flight before in my life, and had never even heard of hidden city ticketing/throw-away ticketing before I started to think about my options to extend this already-booked trip. But then I did way too much Googling and I am completely paranoid! 

I guess what I am asking is - if I have a perfect track record of never missing my flights, and I just completely skip my return flight home from Ibera/AA (Malaga-Madrid-USA) because my plans changed, what is the chance that AA and or Iberia will charge me the difference in the cost between my round-trip purchase and what the one-way flight is? It's thousands of dollars for the one-way departure flight at this point, so if there is a chance that they would do this to me I can't really risk it. My intent when I booked the full round trip ticket was not to ""throw away"" the second half - it's just that my plans have really changed.

2. On my way back from London, I have a layover in Chicago before flying home into Newark. I collect my bags in Chicago and go through Customs there, right? And then do I have to go check my bags in again and pay $25 checked bag fee to get to Newark? (flying American Airlines)

I live in Philadelphia, so naturally I'm trying to fly out of Philadelphia, but I also searched for flights out of JFK (New York).  I went to eight different airlines (British Airways, US Airways, Delta, Virgin Atlantic, Finnair, Iberia, American Airlines, United Airlines) and regardless of whether I picked Philadelphia or JFK as my departure point, every airline ticket was $1,281.72.  

Is this normal?  I imagined all of the airlines would be similarly priced, but are they usually the same to the exact cent?  This seems like a textbook case of collusion.

The only airlines I found with different prices were Air Canada and Lufthansa. Lufthansa was about $1,305, and Air Canada was about $1,100 but with a lot of layovers.

I am by no means an expert on this, but an article released by the Department of Justice in 2011 based on more recent data finds that the tides have shifted and that regulators need to be careful to maintain enough competition since fewer competitors results in higher prices (and less benefit to the public.)\n\nFrom the article:\n\n""Over the past seventeen years, DOT has granted immunity to over twenty international alliance agreements, permitting immunized participants in these alliances to collude on prices, schedules, and marketing. In recent years, DOT has granted immunity to larger groups of airlines in the three major international alliances, significantly reducing the number of independent competitors over the North Atlantic. In fact, though over twenty airlines offer trans-Atlantic flights, three groups of antitrust immunized carriers (one within each alliance) combine to carry over 82% of the U.S.-E.U. passenger traffic. (2)\n\nDecisions to grant antitrust immunity to international airline alliances are controversial and regularly prompt many filings in DOT proceedings on their effects on consumer welfare. (3) A principal concern is that the grant of immunity eliminates competition between the participants in routes where they offer competing flights, adversely affecting consumers in these routes. Antitrust concerns have focused in particular on the loss of competition in trans-Atlantic routes where the alliance partners offer competing non-stop flights, so called non-stop overlaps. Carriers filing alliance and antitrust immunity proposals at DOT (""Applicants"") argue that an antitrust immunity grant enables the partners to deliver significant benefits, principally in the form of service to more destinations and lower fares to passengers who travel with connecting itineraries (that is, itineraries that include intermediate airport stops). The evidence in the published economics literature, which uses 1990s data, generally supports claims that antitrust immunized international alliances benefit connecting passengers and also shows that they may not harm passengers in non-stop overlaps. (4)""\n\nYou can read the whole report here: http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/eag/267513.htm\n\nWhat is likely happening is that the carriers within each of of the big three alliances are (legally) using their immunity to price match within the alliance... While there is still competition between the three alliances, it is like having three competitors rather than a handfull of airlines competing. It is of course in the best interest of each alliance to keep the fare as high as possible, so you end up with identical or very similar fares between all the airlines between your origin and destination.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, (and this is pure speculation on my part... ) but I suspect the decision by Emirates to offer flights between JFK and Milan triggered the backlash of the big US carriers and their claims of unfair subsidies and ownership structures of the big carriers in the Middle East. The Open Skies agreements and fifth freedom rights allow an unaffiliated carrier like Emirates to come in and add more competition across the Atlantic, thereby eroding the benefits of antitrust immunity.', 'Is there a way I can tell if that is the case?

196,Getting a Venezuelan visa,1,435yz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/435yz9/getting_a_venezuelan_visa/,11,1454052064.0,"Hi all,

Venezuela relatively recently introduced rules so that you have to get a travel visa before entering the country. I am a student who will be traveling there as part of some summer South American adventuring before starting work in the fall. As such, some of the documents they are requiring of me don't necessarily exist, and I'm wondering how difficult the embassy will be about them. If anyone else has gone through this process, I'd love any insight you can provide into some of these requirements!

Here's the [full list](http://eeuu.embajada.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=35:visa-de-turista&catid=9:tramites&Itemid=57&lang=en) of required documentation:


>1) A completed visa request form.
2) Original passport with a minimum of six (6) months of validity remaining as of the expected travel date and at least two blank pages.  3) Copies of the passport pages that show personal information, the expiration date and the photograph.
4) Two (2) recent front-facing photographs with a white background, size 2x2 inches (without glasses or hats).

These are all easy enough. I do have a few questions on the visa request form--will the embassy be helpful in answering them on site? What if I don't have hostel reservations yet--should I just make some up for the sake of the application?

>5) Proof of employment issued by the applicant’s place of work, on official letterhead and indicating a contact person and address for verification.
6) If the applicant is not a U.S. citizen, a copy of the green card or document that establishes residency in the country.
7) Leasing contract for a residence or document demonstrating house ownership in the name of the applicant, or a document demonstrating ownership of a different type of property, including high value personal property (e.g. a vehicle or fine art), or commercial, business or industrial properties.

This is where things get tricky. My future employer cannot provide proof of employment since I haven't started yet. I do also work as a graduate teaching assistant for my university. Will this be sufficient proof? Will they put two and two together about me no longer having that job over the summer? In a similar fashion, I have no leasing contract; obviously I don't have a lease set up for this fall yet, and my current housing is provided through the university (and there are no standard leasing documents demonstrating my occupancy like that. Should I just get some non-traditional letter from them indicating I have housing? Will that even be effective given that they will have to indicate I *won't* have housing during the months I'll be traveling? Could I make a copy of my driver's license and refer them to my parent's house?


>8) Original latest bank statement or a letter issued by the bank which shows the current balance or a notarized letter of invitation of the person or institution in the U.S. or Venezuela who will cover the costs of the applicant’s stay.

How much money are the expecting to see?

>9) One (1) copy of the flight itinerary (which indicates the date of entry to and exit from Venezuela, the name of the airline and the flight number).

Soooo I'm not flying into or out of Venezuela. I'm entering by bus from Colombia and exiting by bus to Brazil. Will they care about this?


I get that these rules are put in place as a reciprocal reaction against the US's restrictions, but what I'm concerned about is entering some bureaucratic nightmare where I have to return to the embassy (which is hours away) more than once. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

198,Best Flexible Flight Search Tool?,3,3w4t90,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3w4t90/best_flexible_flight_search_tool/,12,1449727678.0,"I have a pretty cool job that allows me tons of flexibility during certain periods so I can travel a good amount.  Unfortunately (or not?) I've checked off a lot of my major 'bucket list' type places off over the last couple years so at this point I'm just looking for interesting places to go and good deals on flights to get their.

I've tried a ton of different tools but haven't found one that perfectly meets all of my needs for flights, so I thought I'd see if any of you smart internet folks have thoughts.  I'm looking for a way to:

- Search for flights from Point A to ""anywhere"" 
- Being able to specify time frame and flexible (leaving 12/9 and returning 12/16 **or** leaving anytime between 12/9 and 1/9)
- Being able to specify airline or alliance (only looking at American Airlines/Oneworld flights)
- Sorting by cost
- Bonus point if it shows what is cheaper than usual or a good deal, but not required

Some search engines I've used that get close to what I'm looking for but not exactly:

- [ITA Matrix](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) doesn't allow ""anywhere"" location.
- [Momondo](http://www.momondo.com/trip-finder/) doesn't let you put in custom dates (only lets you select a month, so 12/1 - 12/31, but not 12/15 - 1/15) and doesn't let you filter by airline.
- [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/) doesn't allow ""anywhere"" location.
- [Adioso](http://adioso.com/) doesn't allow any real filtering of result.  Once results are returned you can't sort at all.
- [DealsRadar, owned by Adioso](http://adioso.com/deals/new-york-new-york) filtering tools are similar to above and really odd.  Unclear how the results are calculated because sometimes they're perfect and other times they're months off what was searched. 
- [SkyScanner](http://www.skyscanner.com/) doesn't let you put in custom dates, doesn't allow filtering by airlines, can't really see prices on search.


When all is said and done I think that a combination of Adioso and DealsRadar gets prettttty close to what I'm looking for but not exactly...  There's another site called [Flight Fishing](https://www.flightfishing.com/) that sends emails when good deals on flights from Point A to ""anywhere"" come up that's cool for random things too.

Anyways, anyone have any other secret flight search tools (or one that I'm blatantly missing) worth checking out? ","['> Search for flights from Point A to ""anywhere""\n\nI would use ITA Matrix anyways. You can put a super long list of airports in the destination. I doubt you\'ll really go ""anywhere"" but rather a subset of ""anywhere"" that are considered ""popular destinations"". \n\nWith that in mind, have a few ""areas of interest"" ready, like ""Western Europe"" or ""North Asia"" and just do this:\n\nPut FRA (Frankfurt) for example, click Nearby Airports, set radius to 2000 miles and search.\n\nOr put PEK for North Asia, again click Nearby Airports, set radius to 2000 miles and search.\n\n> Being able to specify time frame and flexible (leaving 12/9 and returning 12/16 or leaving anytime between 12/9 and 1/9)\n\nThere\'s a search by month - as long as you know roughly how long you want to stay. ""Month Search"" plus stay ""7-14 days""\n\n\n> Being able to specify airline or alliance (only looking at American Airlines/Oneworld flights)\n\nITA can do that. Enable ""Advanced Routing Codes""\n\nPut, in the advanced routing codes box:\n\n/alliance oneworld \n\n> Sorting by cost\n\nITA does that automatically.\n\n\n\nHere is a list of airports to get you started.\n\n\n\n**China**:\n\nCTU, CAN, XMN, XIY, SHA, PEK, HKG, SZX, TAO, WNZ, HRB\n\n\n**India**:\n\nDEL, BOM, MAA, BLR, CCU, HYD, COK, AMD, GOI, PNQ, IDR, JAI\n\n**Africa**\n\nCAI, JNB, CPT, HRG, LOS, SSH, NBO, ADD, ALG, CMN\n\n\n**USA**\n\nLAS, LAX, SFO, ORD, ATL, NYC, SEA, IAD, IAH, MSP, DTW, BUF, DEN, DFW, PHX, CLT, BOS, PDX, SAN, MIA, FLL, MCO\n\n\n**Thailand:**\n\nBKK, CNX, CEI, CJM, HDY, HHQ, KKC, USM, KBV, LPT, LOE, HGN, MAQ, KOP, NST, NNT, NAW, PYY, PHY, PHS, PRH, HKT, UTP, SNO, THS, URT, TST, TDX, UBP, UTH\n\n**Japan, Korea**\n\nITM, UKB, KIX, TKS, TJH, SHM, NGO, NKM, TAK, OKJ, TTJ, KMQ, KCZ, YGJ, HIJ, FSZ, IZO, OKI, TOY, MMJ, MYJ, OIT, MYE, UBJ, HND, KKJ, NRT, IBR, KMJ, FUK, KIJ, KMI, HSG, FKS, KOJ, NGS, TSJ, USN, KPO, PUS, SYO, GAJ, SDJ, TNE, TAE, FUJ, KUM, AXT, YNY, HNA\n\n**SE Asia**\n\nPNH, REP, HAN, SGN, DAD, SIN\n\nAOR, MKZ, BWH, IPH, KTE, TGG, KUA, MEP, PKG, RDN, SWY, SZB, TPG, TOD,\n\nKUL, PEN, MYY, KCH, JHB, SBW, MUR, KBR, LGK,\n\nVTE, LPQ, PKZ, ZVK, XKH, ODY, HOE, LXG\n\n**Germany:**\n\nAAH, AOC, AGB, FKB, BER, SXF, TXL, BYU, BBJ, BMK, BWE, BRE, BRV, CGN, DTM, DRS, EME, ERF, FRA, FDH, HHN, HAM, XFW, HAJ, HEI, HGL,\n\nHDF, HOQ, IGS, KSF, KEL, LHA, LEJ, LBC, CSO, MHG, FMM, MUC, FMO, FNB, NUE, PAD, REB, RLG, SCN, SGE, STR, NRN, GWT, ZQW\n\n\n**Swiss:**\n\nBSL, EAP, MLH, BRN, GVA, ZHI, ZIN, QLS, ZJI, LUG, QNC, SIR, ACH, SMV, ZRH\n\n**UK:**\n\nEMA, ORM, NQT, LTN, NWI, SEN, LON, MME, NCL, LPL, BLK, MAN, SOU, ESH, LYX, MSE, GLO, EXT, BOH, NQY, LEQ, ISC, BRS, BHX, DSA, LBA, HUY\n\n**Canada:**\n\nYTO, YUL, YVR, YQG, YEG, YYC, YOW, YHZ, YWG, YYJ, YYT, YQB, YXE, YQR, YXX, YKF, YQT, YXU, YHU, YQM\n\n**Europe:**\n\nVIE, IST, ATH, PAR, LON, FRA, MUC, CGN, PRG, BCN, MAD, ZRH, GEN, TXL, AMS, BUD, FCO, MXP, VCE, SPU, OSL, CPH, ARN, BRU, WAW, HEL, DUB, EDI\n\n**Russia:**\n\nMOS, EGO, URS, LPK, BKA, DME, VOZ\n', 'ITA Matrix is more or less the best option available to you. Just add multiple airport codes when searching. Similarly for Google Flights, you can search by continent or geographical region instead of ""anywhere."" Just perform a few high-level geographical-region searches and compare the results.\n\nI work in travel/flight booking tech and people often ask for these tools. The truth is that there\'s no truly open-ended search tool with comprehensive global data. Open search is a pretty limited use case (few travelers are price-insensitive and without any criteria or preferences, for one). Secondly, that is just massive amounts of data to maintain, and it\'s incredibly expensive to run those search queries.\n\nI\'ve probably violated an NDA somewhere. Luckily, no one knows that I\'m actually a cat so.', 'Google flights allows you to search any destination. Just enter you departure airport, leave the destination blank and select the explore map. It will show the prices to all destinations it can find from the departure city. Also, it will filter by airline alliances. Oneworld is the first one on the list when you select the airline filter.

Would love to hear feedback and thoughts on how to check these boxes for you more completely."", 'protox88 has the best answer, imo, but I would like to add a few tools worth keeping an eye on:\n\n[Kayak Explore](http://www.kayak.com) - This allows you to search Point A to \'anywhere\'. It will allow you to search based on month or season, and shows you \'good\' deals. It might not return the absolute *best* deals, but it will give you an idea of what is considered a good price (ie. if you find something cheaper elsewhere, you know you\'re probably on to a *really* good deal)\n\n[Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/) - Essentially same as above. Sometimes it\'s more user friendly if I\'m searching specific regions or airports... Play around with different sites, you\'ll get a feel for which sites are better at specific types of search\n\n[Skiplagged](http://www.skiplagged.com) - This is a great tool if you know where you want to go. It helps to find hidden-city ticketing: You want to travel A-B, but flights are $300. Skiplagged might find A-B-X for $200, you just don\'t fly the last leg. Sometimes the ""x"" flight is somewhere I\'d be interested in going, so this can also be a good way of giving you ideas on where to go...\n\n\nLast point to note is sites like ITA Matrix, Skiplagged and some others don\'t actually allow you to book the flights - they essentially tell you ""this price is available. Search for it on the airline\'s own website, or try some online booking agent"" - except when you do so, the airline or online travel agent actually quotes you a different price. If you find this is the case, try aggregator sites like [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com) or [Kayak](http://www.Kayak.com). The long story short is different sites use different reservation systems, which can lead to different pricings.\n\nFun story: Kayak recently showed me a fare for $230. When I went to search the exact flights through the airline\'s own website, I was quoted over $100 more. I went back to Kayak, searched the same flights again and clicked to book them. Kayak then linked me directly to a booking page on the airline\'s website that actually allowed me to book the cheaper fare.', 'hopper.com you can search by region or city pair, for a month/year or specific dates', 'If you go click on ""entire month"" on Skyscanner it shows you all the prices for all the dates that month.', 'Hmm that\'s a really interesting approach and one I haven\'t thought about!  Do you happen to know what what point ITA Matrix rejects a search due to too many airports?  I know Google Flights has similar functionality but only lets you search up to 5 airports at once.\n\n**Update:**  After playing around with ITA this actually works well, minus random timeouts.  I put all the routing codes your provided (excluding Canada and US) into destination and went from there.  Looks like ITA times out after about a minute so keeping the search simple and filtering after is important.  \n\nFor example running the above search works but if I limit it to oneworld in the routing code it times out.  Instead I had to wait until the calendar screen, and deselect non-oneworld airlines.  Additionally limiting the departures seemed to decrease the chance of a timeout too.  Both ""NYC"" and ""JFK, LGA, EWR"" but LGA alone does not. \n\nI think I\'m going to run with this and put together a list of all the codes for every intentional airport on each continent and just have to run 5ish separate searches (or in theory 15 if I were to get all NYC airports) and see what happens.  ', ""Looks like I'll have to get my cats to paw print NDAs in the future...\n\nI feel like this type of tool would be pretty easy for one of the major alliances to make though.  I can imagine the UI would be a challenge, but airlines seem to not care too much about that.  Is there just not enough demand for a tool like this?  Or is it more that there isn't much profit in it?  Or both?"", ""I don't think you need anything in the routing code except the oneworld. If you put an airport in the routing code, it tries to force a connection at that airport.\n\nI usually put 20 airports in the destination field at a time.\n\nGoogle butchered ITA Matrix when they released version 3. The old one handled timeouts and crazy searches a lot better.\n\nThe airport list I gave you was mostly for destination inspiration.\n\nOh I see what you meant. You put every airport into the destination. I would try grouping it anyways. \n\nOtherwise it might find you an itinerary that lands in Africa and returns from China."", ""Thinking off the top of my head instead of working:\n\n1) No alliance offers completely comprehensive data, so they would still need to form partnerships with enough airlines or alliances to offer sufficient search results. So the big guys likely won't waste effort.\n\n2) Data is expensive to buy, store and analyze. We see about a billion airfare searches daily (total, not unique) across carriers, for instance. It's just huge amounts of data with prohibitive startup and storage costs. So the new guys won't either.\n\n3) The UI could be challenging, although you could probably build off of Google Flights or Skyscanner.\n\n4) The demand is very, very low. More than 80% of domestic flyers have a destination in mind and are fairly inflexible on date and price. Some of that remaining 20% is premium passengers and business class. The rest (now a very small percentage) are dateless/destinationless leisure travelers.\n\nIn case you were thinking of building a flexible search tool, there's your market research above. :D"", 'Perhaps landing in Africa and returning from China would be a fun challenge though!  :) \n\nEither way, thanks for the inspiration.  Looking forward to playing around with this more.']"

It expires in a year from this past December I believe, I'm looking to travel over my college's spring break (early/mid April) or the summer (May 20 to September) for up to a week. I was thinking about going somewhere to see the [August 2017 eclipse](http://www.eclipse2017.org/2017/path_through_the_US.htm) but nothing is set in stone. 

Since money is kind of tight (outside the tickets) I don't think international travel will work but if anyone has suggestions, please, I'd love to hear them.

I'm also not able to rent a car since I'm under 25 and the places that will rent one will charge me much more so I would like to go somewhere that is easy to get around, I love public transit, walking, and bike rentals. 

I'll also be doing this alone, so no date nights and I'm not into nightlife. I like places with historical significance and nature, hiking and museums are always a good time for me, climbing if it's cheap. I'm also interested in exploring city life, it'll also probably be easier to get around in a city. Festivals of just about any kind that are going on around that time are great.

I live in Maryland, very close the DC, and I've done a lot of the east coast so ideally I'd like to go west, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, maybe Texas. 

Like I mentioned before, my budget will probably also not be exquisite, I'm hoping to not spend more than $150 per day after the hotel costs.

So, in short, I need some suggestions on where to go and what to  do that:
* Southwest travels to

* Is easy to get around (no car or rental)

* Has museums or outdoor activities, though I'm not opposed to city life and I like festivals

* Has activities on the cheaper side of things

* Traveling in spring/summer

* Preferably going west

* Possibly planned around the August 2017 eclipse

Anything r/travel has to offer would be great! I can't wait to hear what you all have to say!","['I\'m a cyclist and history buff, and I only fly Southwest, so we have some things in common.\n\nPersonally, I found **Portland OR** to be one of those ""great place to live but not very interesting to visit"" towns.\n\nI enjoyed **Austin** very much, it has LBJ museum, state capitol, bats under the Congress St. Bridge, and the worlds first photograph on display at the Harry Ransom Center at UT Austin. \n\nWe enjoyed **Denver**; there is a nice historic district and downtown shopping district, and is very walkable. Not sure it would be great solo. People say Boulder is better, but Southwest doesn\'t fly there. We were there in winter for a short trip, so I don\'t have the best sense of it.\n\nI found **Louisville KY** to be more charming than I expected. You could take a bus tour of distilleries, if you like whiskey. Also I took a nice bicycle tour with Louisville Bicycle Tours. If you don\'t like whiskey, maybe not the best choice.\n\nI can\'t not mention **New Orleans**, although some people find it a difficult city to visit solo. There\'s not a lot of museums beyond the WWII museum; it\'s very centered around nightlife, drinking, and live music. However, there are historic cemeteries and a few beautiful historic districts, some of the best food and cocktail culture in the US, and I loved it better than I expected. It\'s the only American city I have visited where I really felt the culture was unique and different from the rest of the US.\n\nBig cities like **Chicago** or **San Francisco** will have plenty to do.\n\nIf you like festivals, a good approach might be to find one you like, and plan around that. Austin has a great Book Festival in November, although you say you cannot travel at that time.\n\nhttps://www.texasbookfestival.org/festival-schedule/\n\nLooking at the eclipse route, **Nashville** seems to be your best bet. I breezed through Nashville quickly and was not impressed. OTOH, many people loved it, and it is possible I missed out. The downtown seemed very overbuilt and charmless to me. I did visit the state capitol and Parthenon, and Station Inn for bluegrass. And Andrew Jackson\'s Hermitage is not far, I assume you can take Uber or a taxi.\n\nSouthwest also flies to **Memphis**, which is a great town, but the eclipse is partial there. Also a big music/drinking/nightlife town.

My favorites have been:  

* Iceland for it's otherworldly beauty
* Ireland for the people, whiskey, beers, and amazing scenery
* Morocco for the walking back in time feeling, Chefchaouen and desert camping 
* Peru for the incredible food, hiking and price

The missed flight might not get communicated from UA -> Priceline -> AA. \n\nEven if the ticket cancelled by Priceline, I can't help but think this is something you could talk your way out of.

I've actually only heard good things about Asiana, but since the news, I've read that their pilots are not trained on technology as sophisticated as American airline companies.

In August 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration froze service from Korean carriers coming into the United States, limiting them to the schedules and aircraft they were then flying, because it considered safety regulation by the South Korean government inadequate. The restrictions were later lifted.\n\n>In December, 1999, a Korean Airlines 747 cargo jet crashed near London.

Right now the best deal I've found for my times is 870 dollars on Japan Airlines, with a airport change on the return trip from Haneda to Narita, with a layover of 4 hours and 15 minutes. 
The only one I could find that didn't require at least one airport change in airport in Tokyo was a 1250 dollar flight with American Airlines (though operated primarily by JAL) and a few multi-airline flights that I'd rather not take because they'd leave me with a gigantic 10 hour layover in Shanghai, and because all of them use United for the flight from ORD to shanhai, and I hate United. 

So essentially I am left with the 1250 flight or the 870 dollar flight.
I know financially it would be worth it because the ticket from HND to NRT is 4000 yen or something like that, and I don't care about the hassle  because I will only be carrying a small carry-on bag for my return trip, which is the part that has the airport change, and I'd certainly love to get some pictures since I've only ever been to Narita.

Once I arrived at LAX with a 15-some minute delay, I was told to go through customs, collect my baggage, re-check in baggage, and go through security checkpoint again in order to get to my next connecting flight (LAX-SFO), which was about 1.5 hours away. 

Baggage claim took a long time. I could not have been any faster than I was, yet I only got my bags 15 minutes before my next flight. I rushed to get to the connecting terminal afterwards but was told that bags could no longer be checked in due to the impending departure time.

So, I had to re-enter security checkpoint by counting my check-in baggage as a carryon, which meant that I was forced to throw away all my liquids over 3.4 oz that I had originally stored in my original check-in, including expensive alcohol that was purchased as a gift from Taiwan (so not duty-free).

Once I got to the gate, my flight had already departed, and they had to rebook me for the next flight at 4:40pm. 

Technically the flight was not delayed, yet they were the ones who were slow to begin with and made me get into this situation as well as miss my connecting flight. Is there anything I can do with American Airlines to compensate for my loss? Thanks for your help!

219,Concerned about traveling through London Heathrow Airport.,3,2wt89p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2wt89p/concerned_about_traveling_through_london_heathrow/,11,1424676714.0,"So, I wasn't sure if this was the correct subreddit for this post, but I figured it was worth a shot.

At the end of May, I am traveling from the US to Germany for an 8 day vacation. I am an American with a USA passport.

However, due to absurdly high ticket prices out of Atlanta to Germany, I have booked a round-trip flight from ATL -> LHR with a layover in Boston on Virgin Atlantic. 

I am planning on using Lufthansa and Germanwings to get from LHR to Germany and back to LHR.  This might be a bit crazy, but it saves me a substantial amount of money.

My flight arrives into Heathrow around 9 am, and the flight I'm hoping to take to Munich doesn't leave until 1:30 pm (both local London time).

My first question is, does this pose any potential issues, even possibly being denied entry to the UK? If asked, should I be honest about clearing customs just to get on a different airline to Germany, or do I just say that I am visiting?

Second question is -- does the above scenario give me enough time to clear immigration/passport check, claim my bags, check in to Lufthansa, go through security, and get to my gate?

This is my first overseas trip and I'm unbelievably excited, but I want to make sure I'm not setting myself up for any big issues.

Thanks!","[""Transferring a flight doesn't pose issues about getting into the country. Heathrow is all about transfers.\n\nThe time in itself should be fine in terms of getting between terminals and leaving arrivals etc., they give transfer times depending on your terminal (for you you'll need to get from terminal 3 to 2)on the airport website. But if you've booked them on separate bookings and your inbound into London is late to the point where you miss the 1.30 flight or you get delayed at immigration or in the baggage hall (since you'll probably have to check them in again if it's a separate booking) or anything else then you're fucked and will need to fork out for a new ticket.\n\nObviously you don't tell immigration that you're visiting in the UK when you're not.

This might be a bit crazy, but it saves me a substantial amount of money.\n\nYou should know that it's a bit risky. In particular, if your flight from Germany back to Heathrow is late, then you could be on the hook for a one-way ticket back to Atlanta. I hope you have given yourself ample headway, as budget flights are often tardy.\n\n> My first question is, does this pose any potential issues, even possibly being denied entry to the UK? If asked, should I be honest about clearing customs just to get on a different airline to Germany, or do I just say that I am visiting?\n\nIt's never a good idea to lie to border officials. They spend all day long sniffing out lies, and they're better at it than you are at lying. Furthermore, in this case there's absolutely nothing wrong with what you're doing, and they're not going to make an issue of it."", ""You will have to pass through immigration but that won't be an issue. You'll be arriving in Terminal 3 and departing from Terminal 2, which are adjacent to each other, they're linked to the same tube station and have walkways connecting them.\n\nThat's plenty of time for the connection, but check in online for the LHR departure before you leave the US. "", ""The couple of times I've traveled through LHR to someplace else in Europe (from the US), it's been on the same airline/ticket, so I can't say for sure if you are in the same situation, but here's how things went for me (more than once): Got off long haul flight from US. Followed signs to connecting flights (mine was in T5, so follow the signs to the correct terminal for your connecting flight). It was a bit of a walk, but eventually I got to T5 and then went through normal airport security again and that was it. Then proceeded to the gate for the next flight. So it probably took no more than 30 minutes. You won't clear customs or immigration at LHR if you are connecting -- that happens at your final destination. Again, I'm not sure since you are switching airlines and it sounds like you have separate tickets.  I guess that if I were you, I'd make sure to be checked in for your flight to Munich before you leave the US (if timing works out), so you'd have a boarding pass to clear security. \n\nall that being said, you have 4.5 hours between flights, which would be plenty of time to clear customs/immigration and re-enter security, but I honestly don't think you will need to do this. \n\nGood luck and have a great trip!"", ""Funnily enough, I followed a similar plan to yours (but in the opposite direction) earlier this year. I flew  GVA - LHR with Swiss and LHR - BOS on Virgin Atlantic.\n\nAnyhow, to give you the tl;dr: your plan is perfectly doable and your timeframe works. \n\n> My first question is, does this pose any potential issues, even possibly being denied entry to the UK? If asked, should I be honest about clearing customs just to get on a different airline to Germany, or do I just say that I am visiting?\n\nAs you are not a citizen of the European Union, there is no guarantee that you will be granted immigration clearance into the UK. However, short of having a criminal record there is little reason that you won't be allowed into the country for your brief transfer. If asked by immigration, you should admit that you are connecting to an another airline and, if they tell you that you could just follow flight connections, let them know that your bags aren't being transferred. You should have a copy of your flight itinerary to provide to the immigration officer upon request. \n\n> Second question is -- does the above scenario give me enough time to clear immigration/passport check, claim my bags, check in to Lufthansa, go through security, and get to my gate?\n\nYes, you will have enough time to make the connection, but understand that if you miss the Lufthansa flight, they have no obligation to make alternative arrangements for you. After clearing immigration, you will reclaim your bags and pass through customs (unless you have something to declare, go through the green-coloured channel). Virgin and Lufthansa operate from **different terminals** so you will need to walk with your luggage from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 (it's a long underground walkway). Once you're at T2, follow the steps as you described! \n\nHave an amazing trip ^__^\n"", ""When you check-in at Atlanta, ask if they can check your bags all the way through to Germany.  If they can, then you don't have to go through immigration, just follow the signs to transit to your next flight.\n\nIf they can't check you're bags all the way through, then yes you will have to collect them at LHR, go through immigration and check-in for your next flight.  You should have plenty of time to do that, with 4.5 hours between flights I would not be worried.\n\nIf you do go through UK immigration, then tell them that you are transiting only (show them your next ticket/itinerary if necessary)."", ""Thanks! I've heard Heathrow can be a bit notorious for long immigration lines."", ""Thanks crackanape! \n\nMy flight from Berlin back to London, leaves at 7:30am, and arrives in London around 8:45am I want to say.  My flight back to Atlanta doesn't depart until 1:05pm.  Do you think that is enough time?"", ""Thanks!\n\nYes, they are on separate bookings.  ATL -> BOS -> LHR is all Delta/Virgin Atlantic and one booking.  LHR -> MUC is on Lufthansa and is booked separately -- which is why I'm pretty sure I will need to have to clear immigration first, and then recheck my bags and go through security again to get to my Lufthansa departure gate."", ""> Do you think that is enough time?\n\nProbably. It's good that it's early in the day, because budget airline schedules tend to slip more and more as the day drags on. \n\nThe longer you have between flights, the better your chances. I wouldn't try to say that X hours is bad and Y hours is good. It just gets better and better as you give it more room.\n\nIf you are really concerned about the money you might lose from missing the final flight, and you haven't booked your tickets yet, then maybe you want to have a larger interval at London. Otherwise I suppose you have to see how it goes. But even if it goes well this time, remember in the future that you really are self-insuring against a budget airline's failure to keep its schedule."", ""Yeah, you might... maybe consider only a carryon?

The spreadsheet only includes lodging, food/drink, transportation and tourist/fun expenses from 2016.  I left out miscellaneous expenses, but I address that later in this post.  


[Here is a link to the spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Km-Az5QxLDM3bt1xfnmxnjE0_xfitYQolx5CqPHeirw/pubhtml)  





**About me:** 39 year old American guy, single, work remotely and have been living the “digital nomad” lifestyle for 2.5 years.



**My style of travel:**  it often fluctuates between backpacker style (changing cities every 3-5 days, staying in hostels, preparing my own meals, etc.) to perhaps mid-level (with nicer meals and staying at AirBnBs or simple hotels).  I definitely do not travel in luxury.  I'm also not really into nightlife, so you want see any wild nights of drinking and partying represented in the data.  However, you will see a few nicer meals pop up from time to time.


**This year:**
  
On Jan. 1, 2016, I touched down in Brazil. Throughout the course of the year, I visited 14 different countries (some more than once) and slept in 50 different cities (again, some more than once).  I visited less places this year than last and definitely slowed down a good bit.



I used an app and this spreadsheet to keep up with my expenses.  I made notes of every expense throughout the year.  


**One thing you should know:** I deleted the “miscellaneous” column from the spreadsheet and removed the associated expenses, as I wanted to focus on lodging, food, transportation and tourist activities.  Also, I feel miscellaneous expenses will vary a great deal depending on the traveler.  In my case, these expenses add up to approximately $7,500.  This category includes many different things such as buying new HDDs, ordering a replacement MagSafe power adapter for my MacBook, travel insurance, health insurance, my DropBox subscription, apps, my mobile phone bill, digital subscriptions, my Amazon bill, haircuts, contact lenses and solution, laundry, gym fees, massage/chiropractic treatments (little bit of a bad back), supplements, clothing, gifts plus shipping, medications, various things for my work, etc.   



The only other expense missing from the spreadsheet is €25 for the visa to Cabo Verde.  




You will also notice the first column on the spreadsheet says “visa.”  I used this column to track how many days I was in a particular country or the Schengen Area.  The tracking may seem sporadic, but if I knew there was no chance I would overstay, I didn’t bother counting the days.




So, here are the numbers.  My expenses from traveling all of 2016:  


**Accommodation**

Total: $5,384.44

Daily average: $14.71 

> I have plenty of friends throughout Brazil, so I was able to stay with them, which kept my accommodation costs down. On the spreadsheet, I tried to indicate the type of lodging and if I was splitting it with someone else.  For example, “AirBnB 1/2” means I was staying in AirBnB with a friend and we were splitting the cost.  The + sign means I was actually paying for two places on the same night.  You’ll notice in Italy, for example, I was still paying for my monthly AirBnB in Palermo, but took off on a little road trip with a friend for a few days so I was paying for my apartment plus half of the hotel expense on our road trip. 
> 


**Food & Drink**

Total: $7,803.70

Daily average: $21.32

> I don’t drink much, but I do enjoy wine from time to time so alcohol is not a huge expense for me.  I would say I probably spend more on food than most backpackers because I love protein-rich meals and I eat a lot.  I also love coffee and have spent $15 or more at cafés in a single day, especially when I’m busy on my laptop.
> 


**Transportation**

Total: $3,305.39

Daily average: $9.03
> 
> 
> With the exception of my flight to Brazil, which I paid for using airline points, this includes all travel in 2016.  Everything from public buses, subways, Ubers, taxis, trains and flights.  It also includes my half of a rental car payment in Italy and my half of gasoline expenses when traveling with friends who have cars.  Some of the flight/train expenses may be logged on the day of purchase or the day of travel.  I didn't have a set method of entering that information.

**Tourist/Fun:** 


Total: $646.73

Daily average: $1.77  

> This category can include things like museum entry, paying for an organized day trip, tipping a free walking tour guide, entry to a palace or even bowling with friends.

I guess that's about it.  I hope someone can use this info to help plan their trip.  If anything is unclear, just let me know and I'll do my best to clarify.

I'm flying from IND to Rome in October 2019 and although it's too early to book my flight, I'm trying very hard to estimate the cost. I have a cruise booked and I am going insane that this piece of the trip is in limbo. I'm extremely impatient and crazy particular about planning ... so I know I have issues. :)

I have a very generous family member with a lot of American Airlines miles who has offered to gift me enough miles to upgrade from economy to business class. He's awesome!! Point being, I will need to fly on American and book through American, not a third party travel site.

American currently has a promotion for buying miles up to 35% off. So, my questions are:

1. Can I combine the miles from my family with miles I purchase, if I purchase miles? I assume so if he gifts them to me vs booking the trip for me.
2. Is this really a good deal? \*\*
3. What do I need to know about using miles that I probably don't know (I don't know much!)?

\*\* Here is what I have calculated and I just don't know if it's too good to be true. I priced May 2019 flights because I read somewhere that May and October travel in Europe is comparable. (I could be wrong).

Economy flight: \~$1400 USD or 60k miles; can purchase miles for $1239. 

Business Class: \~$4500 USD or 115k miles; can purchase miles for $2205 ... but I would plan on purchasing enough miles to cover economy and combine with the gifted miles. This is just for reference.

Seems like it makes sense to buy the miles but I don't want to get screwed. Opinions and info, please! TIA

I've got free flights bouncing all around Europe and am using saved up vacation time at work.  All quite planned out :)

I'm going to Paris for three days to hit Disneyland (need to book hotels and figure out transportation for three days- any frugal hotel recommendations? Should I rent a car or is public transit good in Paris?), then going to the Italy and the Netherlands for several weeks, staying with friends and family in both locations.

I talked AT&T in to unlocking my iPhone.

Is there a good way to get cell service while I'm there for just the duration of the trip (under a month)?  I'd love to have it available to me for emergencies.  Or, heck, Google Maps.

Also- I have a dual citizenship, but had to book under my American name instead of the name on my Euro passport due to limitations in my airlines' rewards booking process.  Any downsides to flying under my U.S. passport that I should expect?


In summary:
* Cheap hotels and transportation in Paris for 3 days, best way to find cheap?

228,An Icelandic + Scandinavian March itinerary with a few questions. (Are you familiar with southern Sweden?),3,5aru7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5aru7u/an_icelandic_scandinavian_march_itinerary_with_a/,11,1478142319.0,"Day 1: TRANSIT: We (my partner and I) are flying out of Seattle, since airline tickets are hundreds of dollars cheaper each. Take the ferry over to Vancouver, stay with a friend downtown. (Allows us both to go to work earlier in the day). 

Day 2: TRANSIT: Take the Quickshuttle to SEA. Arrive at 11am for a 3:30pm flight. This makes me a little nervous but I think I'm just neurotic.

Day 3: REYKJAVIK: Arrive in Reykjavik at 6:45am. I'm not booking anything outside of accommodations on this day, just in case there is a flight delay, etc. Go on a walking tour of the town, explore, rent bicycles if the weather seems to allow it. 

Day 4: REYKJAVIK: Book a bus/ATV tour of the Golden Circle. It's tempting to save money by renting a car, but I don't want to be nervous about driving icy roads in a rental car on vacation. I think the ATV portion will allow us to get away from our fellow tourists a little bit more.

Day 5: REYJKJAVIK. If the weather allows it, hike Hveragerdi or take public transit to explore another town. Any suggestions? I'm finding the bus site a little confusing.

Day 6: TRANSIT/COPENHAGEN: Leave Reykjavik on the 8am flight, arrive in Copenhagen around noon.

Day 7, 8, 9: COPENHAGEN. There's lot of guides online for things to do, I'm excited. 

Day 10: Take the train to VAXJO (4.5 hours). The purpose of this trip is visit my partner's sister, who just moved there to go to university. We want to get lots of time with her in.

Day 11, 12, 13: VAXJO. Any ideas for day-trips if the sister is busy? We're in the middle of Smaland. Nearest big cities are Malmo (2 hours by train) and Gothenburg (2.5 hours by train). Would these cities be do-able as day trips? We visited her in Utrecht (near Amsterdam) last year and had a lot of fun cycling to nearby towns, but the Netherlands were a little more compact. If anyone has any experience in this area, I'd love to hear what towns you found very charming and accessible by train and foot or bike. 

Day 14: TRANSIT: early morning train from Vaxjo to Stockholm (3.5 hours). 

Day 15: STOCKHOLM

Day 16: Catch flight out of ARN back to Seattle. Arrive at 5:40, either make our way back to Vancouver to stay with a friend before catching the ferry the next morning to home (Victoria), or if our flight is extremely delayed, staying in Seattle. 

QUESTIONS: The flight dates are set, but nothing else is. Should I lose a day in Copenhagen to spend in Stockholm? From what I've read, I'm more excited about Copenhagen. 

What to do about currency? I don't have a credit card. I think the easiest thing to do might just to use my debit card to take out cash from ATMs - there's a $5 fee + regular ATM fee but that's better than carrying 4 currencies with me (American, Icelandic, Danish, Swedish - I'm Canadian). 

And how do I best see some beautiful sights near Reykjavik without renting a car? Is the public bus a feasible solution? Or should I just buy a second tour package since who knows when I'll be back? 

I really love Abba. Outside of the Abba museum, will I be able to find Abba merchandise in Stockholm? 

I also really like rollercoasters. Tivoli and Grona Lund are closed seasonally, is there any other parks (maybe more indoor so they're open) along my travels? 

What are your favourite alternative neighbourhoods to stay in, in Copenhagen and Stockholm? In Berlin I really enjoyed Neukoln and Kreuzberg, as opposed to something more downtown-y, as a comparison. ","[""Debit cards and credit cards are super common in Scandinavia.  If you can get a debit or credit card without foreign fees, that would be ideal.  Get some cash as needed, ATMs are easy to find.  \n\nI would consider losing a day in Copenhagen and adding one to Stockholm, or maybe see if there are any events that would sway deciding between two days in ea. vs. 3 in Copenhagen and 1 in Stockholm.\n\nArp-hansen has good hotels in Copenhagen.  They have a budget option called Wakeup if you want to save a little.  Rick Steves' Scandinavia book is really good for hotel recommendations."", ""Gothenburg and Malmö are certainly doable as day trips, though it's obviously going to be a long day. Gothenburg is probably more fun, but Malmö's nice as well. You could also go to Kalmar, which is smaller but closer. As for Stockholm vs Copenhagen, it's all about what you want. I prefer Stockholm, but many people will think that's blasphemy - ultimately, they're both very nice cities. I'd still go for a 2-2 split, because Stockholm is a big city with lots to do. Nørrebro for Copenhagen and Södermalm for Stockholm spring to mind for areas that may interest you.\n\nI'd recommend against checking out another town in Iceland, as the country's main draw is its nature. Just *what* you should do I can't say more about as I actually wasn't there for the nature. \n\nThe Nordic countries are heavy users of debit cards rather than anything else - in fact, there are some places at least in Sweden that don't take cash!

Also be aware that the Öresund bridge connecting Malmö and Copenhagen has a pretty hefty toll. \n\nI've never been to Gothenburg, but I heard it's very nice! \n\nThirdly, if you want a day trip from Växjö, I suggest going up to Jönköping.

I grew up in Las Vegas. The furthest east I have ever lived is Idaho. But after going on a Caribbean cruise in May 2013, I wanted to travel. It's all I thought about. I spent all my spare time reading about places I could visit (you all know what I was going through, I'm sure). I've always been interested in history and other cultures, and the travel really kickstarted my hunger.

So then I am browsing on reddit and I see [this post about Slovenia](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1wgr3e/so_you_want_to_come_to_slovenia_2_dogs_1_bear/). To be honest, I had no idea where Slovenia was, what it looked like, etc. Outside of the winter olympics, I had never heard of it. but it was beautiful in the photos. I realized how much I am missing. Utah is beautiful. Oregon is beautiful. But there was an entire globe I was missing out on. I read about living in Slovenia. It sounded like a place I could see myself living. 

So I started looking for jobs overseas. I looked for legal jobs in Australia and the USVI, but couldn't find anything I liked. Eventually, I stumbled on the US Foreign Service (AKA being an American Diplomat). The process was hard (acceptance rate is comparable to Harvard) and I didn't have a lot of experience, but I didn't have any kids (married) and wanted to travel while I was still young. 

Well, as of last week, I've passed every step required. My career should be starting in March. I have enjoyed my 15 or so months as a lawyer, but I can't wait to get out and meet people and speak to them in their own languages. I'll get a chance to raise my daughter (due in January!) around the world, and I think it will be a special experience for our family. I'll be working as a diplomat, which means I will move from country to country every 2-4 years, working in the American embassies. 

I've been taking notes over the last 10 months about places shared here on this sub. Places I want to live, places I want to visit, and how badly I really don't want to fly United Airlines.

231,Quick question about flying with multiple itineraries,1,7czbco,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7czbco/quick_question_about_flying_with_multiple/,11,1510726681.0,"So I've put a 24-hold on two round-trip itineraries: Airport A to Airport B, and Airport B to Airport D (with a layover in Airport C).
