"2017-04-13 16:53:15"|"UNITED AIRLINES"|"#United #Unitedairlines Seeing that the mainstream media has deluded most of the social media populace, I decided to leave my comments as a person possessing insider information.

Neoliberalism has always been integrated in the bedrock of American society, postmodern or premodern. In any capitalist society, big multinational corporations will always have the final say.

In defense of UA's bumping procedure:
In this case, the passenger dragged down the aircraft refused to comply with the company's terms and conditions. An overseated flight will always result in the bumping procedure if the incentives for vouchers and free accommodation does not offload the adequate number of passengers needed for the staff to be seated, or if no one volunteers to get offboard. An overbooked flight means that passengers will even get to sit on the jump seats (crew seats). If an inadequate number of crew does not go aboard the flight, an immense amount of pressure will be placed upon the crew, rendering the service to be less efficient and degrading quality. 
So, the bumping procedure had to be initiated that flight. Three Caucasians and one Asian were chosen by the computer system to be offloaded. Here's how the algorithm works: Staff-travelers (staffs who are using company privileges to travel at a lower price) will be considered to be offloaded first. Next, the discounted ticket travelers. Then, normal economy class travelers. Then, business class travelers (RARELY), etc. As I suppose you should understand it now:
Lower priority (paid less) travelers will be bumped first. YOU PAY LESS, YOU HAVE LESSER PASSENGER RIGHTS. (The first rule of capitalism for major travelling companies, and they abide to this business model.)
THERE WAS NO RACISM.

Justifications of the incident, pro-passenger and pro-company:
Social media news outlets did not go behind the scenes, and spread disinformation. Let's do a fact-check, shall we?
1. 4 passengers chosen by RANDOM?
No. Algorithms for business. (See last paragraph)

2. ONLY United Airlines bump passengers.
No. Major airlines do so as part of their marketing technique. Air Canada, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, etc. do so.

3. BLATANT RACISM BIGOTRY!
...And the race card has to be pulled by far-left social justice warriors. United Airlines as an airline company has employed most diverse races as employees, and has treated them all fairly, regardless of race. There are Asian employees who like the company because the CEO hates racism and treats them fairly, having no wage and privilege gap between nationalities. Wake up. It?s a globalized company.

4. Achieving the middle ground:
The video footage is incomplete, as it only showed the man being dragged out. What happened before was that the man was asked by airport police/security to be bumped, which he refused to comply, therefore committing a federal offense according American law (breaking a major homeland security law), and was being disruptive to the peaceful atmosphere by waving his fists. Therefore, the security had to forcefully drag him out. He was acting in a passive-aggressive manner for the public to sympathize with him.
Who's to blame? (NOT in an order of importance)
1. The ground staff
The bumping procedure should start before the passengers are seated: the fault lies at the ground staff, as they should notify the cabin crew beforehand, before the flight has boarded passengers.

2. The airport security officer
The officer wasn't a UA employee. Then, police brutality in the US. 'Nuff explained. Always happens lol

3. The passenger
Before buying the ticket he should read the rules of the airline, that the bumping procedure would be initiated if necessary. He refused to cooperate with staff and exacerbated the situation by throwing a tantrum, and hurt himself during the process.

As the incident has sparked outrage and distress in the public mainly due to the brutality, the biggest fault perhaps lies at the POLICE OFFICER. However, the public only cares about what triggered it (UA offloading passengers), and the misconception of the security being a part of their airline company, so they blame the company, despite the company never stated to ?beat the customer until he abides?. United did not break any law, and he agreed to the policy and possibility of involuntary bump when he bought his ticket. They followed protocol as required by law. Once law enforcement became involved (also as required by federal protocol), United stepped out of the decision-making process. They had nothing to do with the rest. The passenger was forcibly removed by federal aviation security (the disturbing clip that everyone is talking about) after running back into the secured area after being escorted out once. Once he did that, like it or not, they (law enforcement) were under full discretion of the law to apply necessary force to remove the threat. I?m not saying it?s pretty, but the only one who actually broke a law was the passenger. 

A little fact:
UA stocks have only dropped 1%. 1 billion was lost yesterday, but today it had risen 800 million, therefore compensating the 2% yesterday.

The moral of the story is that when you take advantage of the service the airport provides, you play by their rules.

To the people who wants to boycott or/and wishes UA to be bankrupt due to this incident: You are deluded by social media. Think twice before jumping to conclusions and doing something irrational. "

"2017-04-19 01:40:48"|"Virgin America or United? Personally, I'd go United."|"This airline is stunningly bad. Seriously, give United your money before these people. Worst policies and customer service I have ever encountered.

I had something unexpected come up and was forced to cancel my flight. I canceled SEVEN WEEKS before my scheduled departure. There was a $150 cancellation fee, which was brutal but understandable. On the page it does the calculation for you, informing me that after the cancellation fee I would be left with a $170 refund. I wasn't in love with it, but I didn't really have a choice. I clicked cancel.
Next day I check my email, and see that the $170 is not paid in cash, but in VA flight credit. What? For the $150 cancellation fee they couldn't even do me the courtesy of giving me the rest of my overpriced ticket price refunded in cash. That important detail was hidden in a morass of microscopic font on a different page. 

So I'm stuck holding $170 in flight credit. This is a problem, because where am I going to fly to? They have like six locations, and two are in Hawaii. To recap, VA gets $150 free and clear, they have seven weeks to fill that seat, and I the consumer am left with $170 of flight credit for an airline that has direct flights to a handful of locations, and if you don't happen to need to go directly to/from those places they charge a truly exorbitant amount for connections (hence my heinously overpriced $330 domestic one-way from JFK to Denver).

So that means I have to basically force a flight somewhere as a grad student to some place I don't need to go in the next 18 months, because that's the other catch -- in the email you get about your new ""Elevate"" flight credit, they cheerfully inform you that your points never expire... as long as you make some kind of transaction every 18 months. Well unless you're a business flyer, it's gonna be pretty tough to use those points every 18 months. I sure am not going to be able to find a way to force a flight to some random location in the next 18 months as a grad student with only $170 credit.

And this really sums up the entire VA experience. Throughout my hours-long conversations with customer service, I was reminded again and again that this was the policy, and I should have read it. Yes, I should have. Clearly. But time and again, whenever I made any decision on VA's website or in their emails, the visible information was always INCREDIBLY misleading. The Terms and Conditions are down at the bottom somewhere, a light gray link in size 4 font on a slightly darker gray background, and the reason they do everything in their power to hide the Terms and Conditions is because they are toxic. They are the least consumer-friendly policies of any company I have ever dealt with ever. 

So, if you have a very precise route and time in mind and you are 100% confident nothing will happen to disrupt that, and the sloppy constellation of oddball locations happens to line up for you, I guess VA isn't your worst bet. But if you have even the SLIGHTEST worry that something might come up, or that you might have to deal with these people for ANY reason, run. Run as far and as fast as you possibly can.

----------------------------------
2014 January - flight from Las Vegas to Houston cancelled because of ""Technical Problems"". Given accommodation in one of the nearby motels. Sure, shit can happen. But we were already sitting on the flight when we were told this. And then we had to wait in the rebooking line for more than 1 hour.

2014 July - United flight from IAH to Frankfurt. Gate agent would not let me in on the flight although I have a valid US immigration status and passport. Interestingly, my wife and child travelled the same route two weeks ago on UNITED. Rebooked for 2 days later because flights are fully booked the next day. They rebooked it but made a mistake in the connection. My connecting flight was scheduled to leave 1 day before I reach Delhi. Lots of trouble at Delhi airport as United offices are closed during the day.

2014 December - Sister in law coming from Delhi to Houston. Flight delayed by 1 day because of (you guessed it) ""Technical Problems"". Provided accommodation but given no information on when the next flight is due.

2015 January - Same Sister in law going back to India on United Flight. This time United lost the luggage. And now they are giving us the run around. One of the excuses was - your check in contains liquids. So we cannot ship it....

They also said that through united airlines there were no transactions of $75 US (WHICH THIS BS OF A COMPANY CHARGED ME). Therefore, this company took the information I gave them impersonated me to change the flight. Then this FRAUDULENT COMPANY proceeded to charge me for NO REASON. THEY CLAIMED IT WAS UNITED AIRLINES, IT WASN'T.

I then told united airlines that since this FRAUDULENT company has my infromation can they please make sure no changes are made to this flight. They agreed and advised me to contact my bank (already did that).

These shitty people had the audacity to YELL and RAISE THEIR VOICE WITH ME and TELL ME they did me a favour and I should be grateful and that they charged me only $75 dollars US (which is a $100 CAN).  I WAS ABSOLUTELY LIVID. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FREE IN THE FIRST PLACE. They also tried to get me sign this email they had sent me to agree to them doing the transaction. WHICH I DIDN'T, THANK GOD. So they basically charged me without me even giving them the consent to do so. BLOODY CON ARTISTS.

The airline (Vueling) is refusing to compensate me, because I am missing a ""bag tag"", which was taken from me after my original flight was overbooked. What avenues of recourse do I have?

?

Here's the long of it:

* Back in the summer (July) I flew from Amsterdam to Spain on Vueling Airlines.
* I brought only carry-on luggage, but when I was checking in for my flight, the lady at check in said I needed to check my bag as well. I wasn't thrilled but said ok. My bag got tagged, my boarding pass was printed, and a bag tag was stapled to my boarding pass.
* When I arrived at the gate, I was told the flight was overbooked, and I would have to be rebooked on another flight.
* The gate agent printed new boarding passes for me, and the dozen or so other people who were overbooked. I had to trade in my original ticket (with the bag tag stapled) at this point. The gate agent did not transfer my bag tag to the new ticket.
* When I landed in Spain, my bag did not arrive at baggage claim. It appeared that most of the other overbooked folks had the same story, as half a dozen people from the flight were missing their bag.
* We all waited in line at the baggage claim to file reports. I had a PIR report filed with all the relevant details of my bag including flight number, flight time, original flight, type of bag, etc. I was told the bag would be sent to my hotel the next day, and that I would get 50 Euros per day of spending allowance on necessities until that point.
* The next day, I did not hear from the airport. I went out shopping to buy clothes.
* The 2nd day, I still did not hear. I called the airport, and they said they could ship it to my home in the United States instead, since I was only in Spain until the end of the next day. I agreed.
* I purchased a large backpack so I could carry the clothes I bought home with me.
* When I arrived back in the states, the real frustrations began. Every attempt to call vueling was punted around and ended with some arcane instructions for me, plus being told to wait ""about a month"". I heard all kinds of excuses like ""now is a busy time of year for us"", ""check back in december"", ""wait several weeks"", ""wait a few months"".
* I was told the bag was in Vueling's possession and they would get it to me at some point.
* I requested to be reimbursed for the basic necessities I bought in Spain, and was told to fill out a form with the following documents:
   * PIR Report
   * Bag Tag
   * Passenger's Boarding Pass
   * ID Card / Residence Card / Passport
   * Receipts for money spent on basic necessities
   * A list describing the contents of the bag
* I provided all of these documents, except for the bag tag, which I did not have, due to the gate agent taking it from me when my flight was overbooked.
* After 21 days, I was told the bag was no longer in Vueling's possession and was considered missing.
* I requested to be reimbursed for the bag and its contents.
* Vueling has refused to compensate me for either the basic necessities, or the bag and its contents, citing the missing bag tag as the reason. From their support team:

""Regarding your claim, we regret to inform you that it has not been accepted because you are missing one of the vital documents in order to process claims for compensation.? Unfortunately without the original bag tag we are unable to continue the process. We apologize for any inconvinience \[sic\]""

?

This has been a months-long process, where the airline has let my case sit without response for long periods of time. The onus has always been on me to prod for responses, and to try and push for some kind of compensation. The entire experience has been incredibly arduous. The airline has all of the information they need to compensate me, and have even admitted to losing the bag, yet they rely on a ridiculous policy that requires passengers to retain hard copies of their travel documents in order to refuse claim compensation.

?

I have considered hiring a lawyer, but I am worried the fees for the lawyer will be too high compared to a potential reward. I am also not sure if a U.S. lawyer can make much headway against a Spanish airline.

?

I don't want to let the airline go on this. What actions can I take to make sure they pay up? What is my best course forward?"
"2017-11-02 19:26:46"|"Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it..."|"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?"
"2016-01-28 23:58:40"|"UPDATE - Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me and Delta Delayed My Bag"|"**UPDATE**

I have an update regarding my situation as [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/)

After advice from the comments, I haven't contacted Virgin Atlantic yet knowing that I have a weaker case against them.

However, Delta's claim officer called me couple days ago and said that since my flight plan was cancelled by Virgin Atlantic, it's not Delta's fault that they delayed my bags for over a week, so they won't reimburse me anything.

Here's the story about the lost baggage. Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. The whole experience has been super expensive and frustrating for me.

**December 14th, 7 AM** - I flew from PHL to JFK in Delta. 

**8 AM** - I landed in JFK. I was at the Virgin Atlantic's boarding gate for about 45 minutes trying to figure out my travel situation. The VA agents at the boarding gate told me that my bag has been pulled out of the plane and I can collect it from Delta's baggage claim.

**8:45 AM** - When I went downstairs to the baggage claim, I couldn't find my bag. I spoke to Delta agents and they said that *""yes, your bag was pulled out of the plane, but one of our staff made a mistake and put it back on the queue. But your bag is still in the JFK airport. We will have baggage handling guys pull it out from the queue and bring it back here. You can come back after 30-40 minutes to pick it up.""*

**9:00 - 9:30 AM** - I used those 30 minutes to step out to the lounge area and figure out the rest of the trip. I finally booked my tickets with United and made travel arrangements to go to EWR from JFK (neither VA nor Delta helped me here, off course).

**9:30 - 4 PM** - When I came back after 30 minutes, I found my bag was still missing. I checked again - and they said, they are having someone bring my bag to me and asked me to just wait. Now, this is almost 10 AM. I spent next 6+ hours at the airport in the baggage claim area trying to figure out where my bag was. Delta kept changing their story from *""Wait for few minutes""* to *""It's Virgin Atlantic's fault, talk to them""* (spoke to Virgin Atlantic staff but she didn't even bother to look into their system to find my bag), to finally Delta acknowledging, *""Sorry, we can't find your bag, but we know it's in JFK""*. Delta's baggage claim supervisor tried to find my bag in the system. He said the last time my bag was in Delta's system was at 10:30 AM in one of the racks but when he called a staff in the racks area to retrieve my bag, it was not there. And they don't know where my bag is.

**4 PM** - My flight to United was at 8 PM, but I still needed to take a bus to EWR, do security check up again and figure out if they were also going to refuse to board me. Delta's baggage supervisor said *""sorry we messed up""* many times. They acknowledged that it was their own staff who mistakenly put my bag in the queue AFTER it was pulled out from the VA plane. The supervisor asked me to fill out the claim information. I wrote down my Indian (Delhi) address and Indian phone number, and the supervisor said ""we will deliver your bag to your doorstep in Delhi in a couple days"". I got a tracking number and the supervisor told me to track my bag on www.delta.com/trackbag

**4:30 PM** - I leave for EWR. No issues while boarding there.

**December 15th 10 PM (Indian Time)** - I land in Delhi.  I check delta.com/trackbag. I see that the bag is on a KLM flight (Delta's partner) and is in Amsterdam. And it is scheduled to arrive in Delhi on December 16th. 

**December 16th** - I check delta.com/trackbag - no update in status. I spend entire day at my address to make sure I don't miss the delivery. I called Delta, gave them my tracking ID and my baggage tag number - they couldn't find any information about my bag. Asked me to call back next day when they have more information. Delta's 999 Baggage Assistance emailed me saying the same - they have no information but they are trying to find it. I have that email as a record.

**December 17th** - I check the website - still no updates. I called Delta again, they acknowledge that the bag was enroute to DEL through Amsterdam, but they have no current information. Asked me to give them one more day. Email asked for more details, but didn't provide any idea about what happened to my bag. 

**December 18th (Friday)** - I check the website - still no updates. I call Delta - they had no new information for me. They don't know where my bag is. At 4 PM (1 hour before the airline luggage counters close), I simply drove to the DEL airport. Walked up to the KLM luggage counter at the airport. Found my bag sitting there among a pile of other lost and found bags. The staff there asked me to sign my name before allowing me to take the bag home with me. 

**December 19th (Saturday India Time/Friday EST)** - Received an email from Delta - they still have no clue where my bag is. I told them that I found my bag.

**Fast Forward - last week** - Delta sent an email saying that they were sorry for the delay in my bag and that I would be eligible for any purchases I made during this time. Asked me to send them receipts, which I did.

**Couple days ago** - The Delta claim agent called, asked me to tell her why I got out at JFK. I just mentioned *""I didn't have the right documents for Virgin Atlantic, so needed a different flight""*. And before I could even further explain the rest of the story, she just cut me off and said *""sorry, that's not a Delta problem. We are not liable for delay in your bag if you change plans. You are not eligible for any claim. Bye.""*

So there's where I am right now. I paid a huge price for my one mistake of not checking the transit visa requirements. But tell me, what's the Delta's price for being just incompetent? "

I've also been to Japan twice, and would like to go back again sometime (in which case I would probably take ANA).  Both EVA and ANA are members of Star Alliance, as is United Airlines.  I frankly don't plan to fly on United if at all possible, but I suppose I might from time to time.

I believe the flight pattern I am describing unfortunately won't ever result in me being upgraded to a higher frequent flyer status level, but I do want to accrue points that I can spend on flights, etc.  Is anyone familiar with the frequent flyer programs of ANA, EVA, and United, and how their systems work together?  Am I better off sticking with a single frequent flyer program and using it when I fly on any of these airlines, or should I sign up for all three and use whichever one I happen to be flying with?

"2015-03-24 01:43:30"|"Airlines Accountability...You listening American?"|"Often times we find ourselves looking at an airline commercial showing a smiling pilot or flight attendant flying us to beautiful destinations, business meetings, and family gatherings.  They make it seem like a joyful occasion to get on one of their brand new airplanes and take off traveling.  There is another side to this entire story.  It?s a side that only people who fly just as much as me can tell.  

I am an engineer and fly pretty much every week.  I fly so much that my girlfriend says ?thank you for visiting? every Sunday while I am packing for my next trip Monday morning.  Flying a lot does have its benefits and privileges like being one of the first to be upgraded to first class when available, or going through faster lines at checkpoints.  Even with all the privileges that I do have they don?t compare to the days sitting at the airport all day long waiting for my flights that are getting delayed, cancelled, or moved to twenty different gates; today is one of those days. 

The weather is terrible in Chicago IL on March, 15th, 2015.  I woke up thinking we would have spring weather and I truly feel like we are back in January.  Even though my 7:35 flight to Texas is on time it?s a two hour car ride to the airport.  Sure enough I miss my flight.  I probably wouldn?t miss it if American Airlines would update their online system before 7:20am showing that the flight is still there.  As I pull up to O?Hare International Airport I am on the phone with American Airlines and lucky for me there is another flight to Texas.  I am rebooked in less than twenty minutes.  As I step out of my cab I look at the screen and sure enough my flight that I was just booked on is cancelled.  I call the people I was planning to meet and tell them to go ahead without me.  My next flight out of Austin was supposed to go to Denver where I would spend until Friday before I go home again.  I decide to go straight to Denver from Chicago.

As I approach the gate I ask for an upgrade and sure enough I get a first class seat.  Cool right? NO!  We spend 35 minutes getting deiced, 30 minutes wondering why we are not moving, 30 minutes waiting for the mechanic to get on the plane because the pilot notified us there may be something wrong, 15 minutes waiting for the mechanic to tell us he is grounding the flight, and another 20 minutes for American Airlines to tell us that they don?t have any other plane to give us and that we must deplane.  How long was that?  Lets count (30+30+15+20)=1 hour and 35 minutes sitting on the plane without any movement.  First class did get some juice. YEY!

The rebooking nightmare begins as we all scramble to the gate agent who is looking at us like vultures.  With all my status exemptions, bla, bla, bla, I get a 9:15pm departure.  Its now close to 1:30PM.  Yikes!!!  Good news is that there is another flight out at 3:15pm and I am 2nd on standby.  

We live in a world of internet so I open up my Kyak app around 2:30pm and realize that they five seats available on United Airlines.  I call my most amazing Platinum Advantage Desk.  Sounds fancy, right?  NO!  They tell me they cannot put me on this flight because their system is showing 0 seats available.  I decide to call my company?s booking agency and sure enough I was right.  There ARE seats available.  I call Advantage Platinum Desk again and ask for a supervisor.  Gloria Garcia, a very condescending supervisor is telling me no way will she put me on that flight.  

I tried calling the customer relations department but all I get is a very lengthy voicemail of some hotshot explaining to use the web services.  I decided to write a complaint still.

Besides trying to kill time and blow off some steam, there is a point to all of this nonsense.  Accountability.  There is none!!!  Airlines like American Air keep people in the dark, which gets people frustrated and confused.  I missed two important meetings today and my job was on the line.  Knowing all this American Platinum Desk still did not want to help their Platinum member, a member who buys tickets every week two at least two or more destinations.  I am truly disappointed.   What could they have done?  Instead of giving me a juice cup they could have taken my schedule seriously and considered that there might have been a reason I woke up today at 5am to catch my 7:35am flight.  They might have figured something out.  To them, it?s a business and I get it.  But I as a customer bring them this business.  Its pitiful that they had me stoop so low as to write this.

"2016-07-31 19:20:59"|"ELI5: Codesharing"|"Can somewhat explain to me in simple terms what codesharing is, and how does it effect travelers. A few days ago, I purchased tickets from LAX to NRT for $488. An amazing deal that was only better when I found out the flying airline would be ANA. But to purchase at that price, I had to buy the ticket through United that codeshares that flight with ANA. 

Here is my concern. Out of the 2, I would of gone with ANA hands down. If There is a time change, can United if they want change that codeshare flight from ANA to their own fleet and fly it like that, or are they bound to use ANA? Normally codeshare flights I don't mind, but I would prepare the hospitality and food service with ANA rather then United. "

I like how easy it is to see PQMs and PQDs for the trip right on the app, plus the ease of tracking checked bags.  I really find everything about the user interface appealing.

There are some nice things United and AA have on their apps that Delta doesn?t, but overall, they?ve got my vote."

Thank you for your reply, but i'm less than satisfied with your compensation offer of 300$. United Airlines offered 700$ to anyone who was willing to fly stand by on march 19th. As I wrote in my complaint, my brother and I  had important exams and had to work, we were not voluntary on stand by...Honestly , I was expecting the same or a better compensation than anyone who wanted to leave their seats voluntary. The glitch in the system wasn't our fault and be expect United Airline to compensate us in a respectful way. 
Thank you for looking into this file,

Objet : Re: Complaint flight UA4026 (KMM43045265V15026L0KM)
 
 
Dear Ms.X:
 
I apologize that your travel was interrupted by severe weather conditions on March 13, 2017.
 
I can certainly understand how upsetting this was as it disrupted your travel plans. Keeping safety our top priority, we work closely with Air Traffic Control (ATC) to determine the best possible flight path and departure times.
 
 
I'm very sorry to read about the confusion at the airport about your return ticket.
 
I can only imagine how this made you feel. We never intended for your ticket to be canceled. I'll make sure to pass along your feedback so our airports can focus on improving our process. As a way to show we appreciate your patience, I'm sending each of you an Electronic Travel Certificate, which can be used on a future United Airlines or United Express flight. It should arrive via email in the next few business days.
 
We take issues regarding safety and security very seriously. The concerns about how we handled your ticket are understandable. While we do ensure our passenger count matches before departure, there may have been a technology glitch which canceled your return ticket. I do understand, though, as we should have been ready for you when you arrived at the airport. Your time is important. We'll work on getting better at the recovery process.
 
Montreal Convention covers actual provable damages caused by a controllable. Please send me receipts for reimbursement consideration.
 
Your request for a refund is respectfully denied as we do not refund used tickets.
 
Thank you for your business and loyalty to United Airlines. We look forward to serving you on board a future flight.

Laval, March 25th 2017
 
My name is X and I?m writing this formal complaint to the person in charge of customer incl. cc legal and eservice. On February 23th, I paid 1324,90$ for 2 people(My brother, X and myself)to go to Mexico City for 6 days (March 13th to March 19th). We chose to pay more to be back on the Sunday since we both go to school and have jobs. Our problems started on March the 13th, when we arrived at the Montreal Airport (YUL), we learned that our flight (UA8481) was cancelled to Chicago due to weather. After an hour of questioning and asking United Airlines members for a solution, we finally got transferred for a flight going trough Toronto by Air Canada. We finally arrived to Mexico City, 2 hours later than our initial arrival time with flight (UA1547).
 
On March 19th 2017, we showed up at 9h30 am at the MEX airport for our flight back to Montreal. As we check in at the counter, we are told in Spanish that there is a problem with our reservation. For 15 minutes, the lady at the counter couldn?t answer any of our questions since she spoke no English. Finally, the team leader named Diana came to us and told us that the system cancelled our tickets for the flights UA1066 and UA4026! When asked why, she couldn?t give us a clear answer and said that there was probably a glitch in the system. When we asked her what the solution was, she couldn?t provide us with any solution. She offered to reserve two seats to go to Newark, USA, but after that, she had no idea what?s next or how we get to Montreal (final destination). She suggested we would call someone to pick us up in Newark, which is more than 600 miles away in a another country. We asked her to check with other airlines for a flight to Montreal but she said that she wasn?t allowed to do so. During the whole process, we are calling our parents who are panicking because their 20 and 24 years old are stuck in Mexico without any money or hotel. Our parents are able to see online some flights that we could board on time, but the lady at the counter advised us that if we book them, we probably won?t get a full refund from United Airlines. We stayed at the counter for more than an hour without any suggestion from United Airlines staff. The team leader finally suggested that we take the flight from Newark on the next morning (UA3938) and that we could be standby for the flight in the evening. We finally boarded the flight to Newark without any winter apparels. Once in Newark, we have trouble going trough the border control since we don?t have any hotel or seats for a flight. We were questioned for more than 20 minutes because of the situation. We finally arrived at United Airline?s counter to print our boarding passes and once again, we have to tell our whole story because United Airlines didn?t document any information. We go to our gate to wait and see if we can make it but the flight is overbooked. We can hear staff offering a 700$ voucher, a night in a hotel and meals for anyone who is volunteering to fly on the next day.
 
It?s now 21h30 and we still didn?t have any meals since 10 am and we didn?t get any vouchers to eat. The plane left without us and we are now stuck in another country without any information. We go to the United Airline counter and we are shocked to see that we have to retell our story since nothing was documented again, even if it was told an hour before in the same airport. The lady at the counter named ?Shamonette? explains us that we cant have a hotel or any vouchers since she doesn?t understand what happened to our initial reservation. We asked to speak to a manager named Robert and after half an hour of asking, we are told we will have a hotel room. We are advised that there is only one bed in the room, and I
had to beg to get a 2nd bed since sleeping with my adult brother wasn?t an option. We then get a 10$ coupon for food in the airport, this 10$ is suppose to cover 2 meals. I had to literally beg to get a second coupon for a breakfast since we didn?t have any American money. They offered to check in our bags for free to excuse this trouble. We finally go outside in the freezing weather to wait for a shuttle for the hotel, we had to wait 40 minutes outside. We arrived at the hotel at 23h00 and we were told that we have to take a bus at 5h00 am for our flight. After a very short night (we had to sleep in our bathing suits since we had no clean clothes), we arrived at the airport and we went to check in our bags but we are asked to pay the 25$. For the fourth time, we have to retell our story and the lady at the counter goes to ask her manager. The manager accepts, but asked to keep our old boarding passes. We asked him to do some copies since we were planning to document the whole incident and it took 10 minutes for him to finally accept to copy our boarding passes. We landed in Montreal at 10 am, more than 12 hours later than our original arrival time.
 
 
 
For all the issues mentioned above I believe it is not only against the Montreal Convention, but the United Airline convention, and believe we should be refunded and compensated.

Customer service gave us food/hotel vouchers for the night and assigned us the next flight tomorrow morning at 8ish. However when we arrived at the terminal, we saw our flight got canceled, so we went to customer service again regarding our situation. We managed to get new booking tickets for departure 5 hours later. So we just have to wait 5 more hours. In the midst of this, i asked last night at customer service and today regarding our checked bags back in LAX by asking if we had to notify someone or have to claim our bags and go through the process again by checking them in. Both said our bags should automatically transfer over to our next flight and we didnt have to anything on our hands. Meaning our bags will arrive at the destination the same time as we arrived to ft.

I am just looking what's the best thing for me to do and some advice on how to proceed on this nightmare that I faced last month. Also, is there any hope to get any percentage of money refunded - either for departure or return tickets.

**Here's the story (sorry it?s long):**
Couple months ago, I bought a round trip ticket for last month from PHL to DEL (New Delhi, India) on Virgin Atlantic last month. The connecting flights were from PHL to JFK (with Delta - partnering with Virgin Atlantic), JFK to LHR (with Virgin Atlantic), and LHR to DEL (Virgin Atlantic). 

This was my first time flying with Virgin Atlantic. And here was my US Visa situation - I had an expired H1-B visa and I was flying to India to get the Visa renewed. Actually, the visa was already renewed by my employer, so I just need a new Visa stamp in an US consulate, which can only be done outside the US. I confirmed with a Virgin Atlantic customer service agent before flying that my Visa situation would not be an issue on the date of flying.

On the date of the flight, the Delta staff at PHL boarded me to JFK. Once I landed in JFK, the Virgin Atlantic staff at the JFK boarding gate refused to board me. They mentioned that I did not have an UK issued transit visa required for me to go through LHR. What bothered me most is that the staff there looked at all of my documents - my passport, current and expired visa documents - and falsely (I will explain why falsely later) claimed that I do not even have the right Visa documents for United States. They said ?You do not have an US Visa or proper documents, you cannot leave this country and fly anywhere?. In reality, I actually did have all the paper work that I needed to leave the country, go to India, get my visa stamped at an US consulate, and then return back. 

I have been in United States for last 14 years, and this was the worst example of customer service I had ever experienced in my life. The staff were extremely rude, condescending, simply refused to help me, or find me another Virgin Atlantic flight that goes through other routes to DEL. 

When I called Virgin Atlantic customer service for further help, the staff on the phone couldn?t also help me with other routes. They had already flew me from PHL to JFK, so now I am stuck in the middle of my journey in an airport far from my home (Philly) without any help from Virgin Atlantic. If this were still in Philly, I could have just driven home and planned  something better. 

I called the customer service again - this time to cancel the remainder of my journey and they said that I needed to pay $200 more to cancel the remaining trip. I asked if I get a travel voucher instead - and they said that would also cost my additional money ($200+ more). When I asked if I can get a refund, they said the tickets are non-refundable and I needed to talk to my travel agent. I put Virgin Atlantic staff and my travel agent representative on a conference call. Essentially, the travel agent mentioned that the money is already processed by Virgin Atlantic, so VA needs to refund it. And Virgin Atlantic staff refused to proceed with any refund.

Finally, I had to purchase another direct flight on a different airlines (United) from a different airport (EWR) which cost me an arm and a leg. The tickets I bought for Virgin Atlantic were simply a waste since I could neither use them nor get any money for refund. 

In addition to all that, Delta lost my checked in luggage when I flew from PHL to JFK and they couldn?t find my bag in JFK airport. It took them more than 10 days to find my bag (well, more like after repeatedly calling them and trying to identify the location of my bag and unable to get any response from them, I simply drove to the airport in DEL, and found my bag lying near their airport counter, unattended).

Given the terrible experience with Virgin Atlantic, I did not take the return flight with them - so those return tickets were also wasted.

The United flight was a direct flight from EWR to DEL - the staff there did not have any issues with my documentations. And in the US Embassy in New Delhi, I got my Visa stamped instantly - the embassy staff there mentioned that I have been in US for long enough and I had all the right documentations for me to get it instantly approved - contradicting Virgin Atlantic boarding gate staff?s theory that I did not have the right US Visa documentations and hence their ground for refusal to board me. 

**tl;dr** - Virgin Atlantic (in partnership with Delta) flew me from PHL to JFK, before refusing to board me at JFK. Then they refused to refund my money and Delta misplaced my baggage for more than a week.

JetBlue Airways confirmed what anyone who has shopped for airlines tickets lately already knew: the airline, like its competitors, has been aggressively raising fares to offset sharply higher fuel costs. 

Airlines executives are often reluctant, at least publicly, to admit that tickets prices are on the rise, using industry jargon like ?improving yields? to talk about the fare climate.

St. George said jet blue led ?several? successful industry fare increases in the July- September quarter and also led the industry?s baggage fees higher.

In late August, JetBlue became the first major airlines to hike baggage fees. The new charges will be $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for second checked bag, up from $25 and $ 30. Alaska airline?s bag fees are due to increase in December. 

Airlines are able to pass along fuel costs because travel demand is strong from business travelers and vacations. On united airlines? quarterly conference call last week, President Scott Kirby, called it ?one of the best revenue environments we?ve ever seen.?"

Alaska passenger face a bigger increase in the charge for a second bag than passenger on other airlines because Alaska has been charging $25 for the second checked bag, compared with $35 before the increase as other carriers.

Alaska is also increasing the price for a third checked bag, to $100 from $75. That is still below the $150 fee charged by American, United and delta.

I asked if they did anything for her. She told me no. I asked how she found out. I thought at least a manager of some sort had come up and congratulated her on her 30 years with the company. She said that she only found out through payroll. Since the company merged it seems that they do not really seem to care. So I thought, this should not stand. I cannot make the airline recognize her service and devotion to the company that she once loved. But maybe I can do something. My mother has long loved the old United posters for Hawaii, I was thinking I could get one of the posters that she does not own yet. But I thought, that's not enough. I wanted to maybe find someone who can sign the poster for her. Since Walter Varney (founder of United) died in my mothers home town of Santa Barbara back in 1968 and could not find out much more info on any founders I was running out of ideas. But then, I came across an article on Ron Akana. This guy is the oldest living flight attendant and has flown with United for over 60 years! He is also from Hawaii and I figured this guy would be great! But then I hit a snag. I cannot find any contact info for this fine gentleman. This is where I hope that you guys all come in.

They had checked in their baggage in DAY and picked up directly in BOM. There was no need to pick up in EWR. I was of the opinion that they will need to pickup in EWR and put the luggage in next belt for the international flight. I double confirmed with United staff at Dayton and they said no need to do that. But when we enter the US, we usually have to pickup luggage at first entry airport and then take it to next belt for the domestic flight.


So my main question is whether I will always need to NOT PICKUP my luggage within US and will it be through checked in all the way to my final destination ALWAYS ?

Now here?s why, May 31?st 2014 I booked myself a flight from SNA ?John Wayne? to SEA ?Seattle? for October 3rd 2014 along with this so called ?insurance?. Why I booked this flight was due to an event I am attending and I thought it was a great deal ?at the time?. A month had past and some information was given to me by my peers informing me I should switch the fight to October 2nd and be there a day early as I am needed this day. Well immediately I contact United and was informed of their terrible policy in changing flights with all their outrageous fee?s and fare changes. I was informed to contact the insurance company as they should be able to handle this for me. Well this insurance company had no connection with United and had failed to mention that it is only for the event of an illness or unexpected emergency ?would be nice if they provided this in details (not just in the fine print) before purchasing?. So I contact United again ?mind you this is still about 3 months or more ago? and asked what my options where. I was told I can call 24 hours before the flight and pay a flat fee of 75.00 dollars to switch fights under same day. I thought ok I can do this but to protect myself I continued to search other flights and found JetBlue had a non-stop from Long beach to Seattle for 100.00 bucks. How could I say no right? So I contacted United again to verify and was informed by a second person that yes that?s correct. 24 hour same day is a flat 75.00 dollars. So I clearly said ok I will just do that option. The months have now past and one week ago September 26th 2014 I contacted United again to verify that this really is happening and I could be changing my flight 24 hours in advanced to the exact same flight a day prior ?well 26 hours to be exact? and was informed ?YES it is 75.00 dollars and I would change it for you now if I could? I was told. I thought awesome this will be fine, I?m only going to spend 75.00 extra and get there a day early. 48 hours before my flight, I call United again to verify and low and behold I?m given the ?no sir that is incorrect? ?you cannot change your flight for 75.00 dollar?s, you must pay 200.00 change fee plus airfare at 151.00 for a total of 351.00?? Excuse me??? My months and weeks of calling to making sure THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN has HAPPENED. I was in shock so I ask to speak to a manager. Well Mr. Manager gets on the phone and we get to the break down. Well it all gets broken down to that YES you can get that flight for a fee of 75.00 dollars, phew. Well here we are October 2nd 2014. I Call this morning about 30 hours before my flight to verify and am told ?YES you will be able to get on the flight for 75.00 dollars bur we can?t do it for you yet? I asked if it?s best for me to do it at the airport and the gentleman informed me that YES that would be best. (26 hours before my flight) I arrive at SNA and go straight to the counter and am greeted by a nice lady, I give her the whole spiel why I?m here and she looks at me confused. I am now told ?no, no the 75.00 dollar change fee is only for same day. You will now have to pay a 150.00 dollar change fee and airfare?? WHAT??? Well ladies and gentlemen I am speechless. I would get nothing out of this women as she is typing away and not even looking at me. I request my papers back and call United AGAIN, and finally someone within the States answers. I give the WHOLE run down of what has happened and why I am now at the airport looking like an idiot. I am told by her that (with attitude mind you) ?oh your fare doesn?t qualify for the 75.00 dollar change fee, I don?t know why you were being told this...? WAIT WHAT? What am I to do now? I need to get to Seattle like NOW! Here is what my answer was and the option I was given ?pay the change fee?s OR WAIT FOR IT? I can pay a 75.00 change fee for a different flight the next day?.? WOW I am in shock. Didn?t she just tell me my fare was not allowed for the changed fee but now it is on another flight? Well let?s just say United has done NOTHING for me other than get me to Seattle a few hours earlier by paying a 75.00 change fee? Guys and Gals, I urge you all too please rethink before EVER flight United. They are crooks, liar?s and thieves.

Sometimes an airline does everything right.  (I edited the names just in case leaving them in was inappropriate.  Otherwise, the letter is as it was in it's entirety.)

United Airlines  
 c/o Customer Care  
 RE: Flight 980 IAD-DEN

To whom it may concern,

I would like to request that you read this entire letter. I would also suggest that this letter go up the chain in customer care and make its way to Flight Attendant management. Ideally, the CEO should read it but that might be a silly pipe dream. Here?s an ?executive summary? but below that is the full story:

**tl;dr**

? Seating a passenger in need of assistance who had booked a window seat was a cluster  
? The plane was late and further made late by the seating kerfuffle  
? A passenger was very troublesome and demanding  
? Due to storms we were diverted to Albuquerque to refuel so arrived at our destination over two hours late.  
? The plane was packed and there were many children.  
? The flight attendants gave a clinic on how to handle *all* of that.

**The long version**

My family and I were returning from a trip to Ottawa to see our son who is attending university. The flight from YOW to IAD was uneventful. However, upon entering the jetway for IAD to DEN we were met by a gate agent trying to find the person in 9D. Perhaps there was gum on the seat or someone had spilled water and other accommodations were needed. We were glad we weren?t in 9D (We came to find out later that there *wasn?t* a 9D and this gate agent would never find his passenger).

Our relief was short-lived.  When we arrived at our seats (8A, B, and C) there was a family seated there.  They told us they were waiting on *their* seats (10A, B, and C) the isle seat of which was occupied by an elderly and very heavy person. This person had required a wheelchair but had booked a window seat. So, the gate agent parked her in a seemingly random isle seat displacing this family of three and thus displacing us. As a result, we were in the way of the person in 7A who was impatiently trying to get to *her* seat. It was a traffic jam and things were already backed up on the jetway.

After some interesting logic by the gate agent everything sorted and we took our seats.  We in ours, the other family in theirs, and the person who required the wheelchair was given the isle seat at the bulkhead beside a man (READ: saint) whose wife took the window seat that had been left vacant and he the middle seat at the bulkhead.

The next five hours pushed the bounds of incredulity as the passenger who?d displaced everyone created a complete mess around her seat, bothered everyone around her with requests, and constantly called out to and rang for the flight attendants with endless trivialities; even to try to get first class food. It was as if she thought everyone were there to serve just her; the rudeness was astonishing. Now, I do have to say there may have been cognitive decline involved so I can?t completely say with confidence what I perceived was completely accurate. But, we concluded she, with her obvious health issues and possible cognitive decline, should not have been flying alone. Add to that a diversion to Albuquerque due to storms in Denver ? which added two hours or more to our travel time ? suffice it to say it was a rather unpleasant flight. Or *could* have been.

And yet?

The atmosphere in the cabin was calm. There were several babies and young children on board and *they* were calm. Looking back on the evening, it just feels like the flight went well albeit a little longer and no one ever believed everything *wouldn?t* work out.

This can be 100% attributed to flight attendants Suzanne M, Sally R, Shauna J, and Barbara S.  Many times, they addressed the demands of this tiresome passenger. Even after multiple encounters, they did so with a genuine smile.  Each conducted themselves with professionalism, confidence, and most importantly, grace. They were efficient and kind, gentle and direct. I?m certain they were tired after a long day, but they didn?t show it.

Moreover, when we were diverted, they kept us informed of the status even when ?the situation was fluid? and they didn?t have all the information. When they did, they let us know. 

I write this letter to commend them and their abilities. To commend them individually and as the team they were. They essentially gave a clinic on how to be top-level flight attendants who puts safety first but has the skill to address passenger needs and conduct the passenger-based tasks without missing a beat. I don?t know what the internal United rewards offerings are, but they each should get one. A *big* one.

Their conduct and professionalism did more for United?s reputation in our minds than 10 commercials that probably cost millions. I?m not kidding. 

So, please express my gratitude to them and let their management know. They are truly an asset to United. We are just three people but if they do what they did for *many* sets of three, you have a whole customer base that has United top of mind."

I grew up traveling a lot, I have family members working for US carriers, friends who are pilots, and I've spent my entire career as an engineer in the aerospace industry. In the last year alone, I've flown across the country dozens of times (work related), and at least once on every major US airline.

So I'm pretty familiar with most aspects of the industry. The incident on Sunday is a big deal, but I want to go through what happened and talk about it a little. So, from everything I've read, here's the chain of events.

1. United Airlines had ~~an overbooked~~ **edit:** *a fully booked* flight from ORD to SDF.
2. UAL also had to ferry a crew from ORD to SDF, and decided to put the crew on the already overbooked flight because said flight was the only one available. 
3. ORD gate agents asked for volunteers to give up their seats, but still permitted passengers to board the planes.
4. Gate agents then said the plane would not depart until four volunteers gave up their seats, and increased the offer amount.
5. Gate agents then randomly selected passengers to have their seats pulled. A couple was deplaned without incident and then the doctor was selected.
6. The doctor refused to give up his seat, stating that he had medical proceedings to attend to in the morning and needed to take that flight.
7. Gate agents continue to order the passenger off the plane, and he again refused and begun to call his lawyer. Gate agents informed him that they would bring airport security and he continued to refuse.
8. Airport Police showed up and confronted him, passenger continued to refuse to deboard. 
9. Two more police officers arrive and the passenger continues to refuse to deboard.
10. The video that we've all seen begins. The airport police grab the passenger, drag him out of his seat (knocking him unconscious in the process) and off of the plane.
11. The passenger eventually managed to get back on to the plane, exhibiting symptoms of a serious head injury.
12. The plane was completely deboarded and cleaned due to biohazards (blood).

On bigger subs, I've seen a lot of discussion around this issue that tend to gravitate towards these opinions:

* The airline had no right to revoke his ticket, as he was a paying customer.
* The airline was using law enforcement illegally to enforce their will.
* The airline employees were lazy for wanting to fly to Louisville, instead of driving.

So here are my (personal) comments on the chain of events.

1. Airlines should be prohibited from overbooking flights. Yes, I know it is an optimization trick and it keeps ticket prices down, but it's not really fair to passengers and creates very problematic situations. Airlines should increase ticket prices or cancellation fees if need be, but they should be forced to eat the cost of lost revenue from missed itineraries.
2. This is actually a semi-common practice. I don't know UAL's specific policies, but airlines generally can't require their flight crew to have to drive to their destination to make a flight. However, the airline *knew* that the plane was already booked to capacity, so planning on the flight crew to take this route was already a fuckup on their part. They could easily have sent the flight crew down on a flight on another airline, even one the next day. Instead, the airline decided to use their own plane which is not illegal, but is problematic for passengers.
3. I assume the gate agents thought they could save time by boarding pax while calling for volunteers, because often enough people will volunteer. In this incident, the flight was the next day and the offer obviously wasn't good enough for anyone. Gate agents shouldn't board pax until they know they have the seats to fit everyone, but, again, I don't know UAL's policy here so they weren't *necessarily* violating anything. This was a pretty big fuckup though.
4. And the decision to board bites the gate agents in the ass, when they realize they didn't actually get any volunteers. 
5. The gate agents definitely had room to keep increasing the offer amount, but they decided it wasn't worth it. Per most carrier contracts, they were not doing anything illegal though. Airlines *are* permitted to revoke tickets at basically any time at their discretion.  The justification in this case of *we need these seats to ferry crew* is not illegal. It's frustrating, but DOT rules do handsomely reward passengers who are booted involuntarily. Airlines typically will offer flight vouchers, but if the passengers request it the airline must cut the passengers a check for 4x the price of the ticket, or a maximum of $1300. You still get the ticket the next day, too. That's a good deal of money. The couple that got bumped before the doctor could have taken their $2600 and had a very, very good night in Chicago. In many cases that doesn't fix it, but it softens the blow a lot.
6. Gate agents have probably heard it all, and were probably thinking something like: *""Everyone on board has a million reasons why they have to be on this plane tonight. We need to get this guy off so we can get this plane out of the gate.""* Now. Granted. They have the power to have changed their minds here and and redone the selection to pick someone else, but they weren't required to and they didn't, for any number of reasons. In hindsight, they probably should have, but I'm sure it crossed their mind and they assumed that if they relented on this *one* passenger, everyone else would refuse to deboard too.
7. Situation escalates. Passenger calls his lawyer. This is where the passenger also starts to take some of the blame. The airline does legally have the right to remove the passenger, so the passenger was actually trespassing by this point because his ticket was cancelled and he was informed of it. You can argue whether or not airlines *should* be permitted to do this, but currently the airline *is* permitted. This is what some of that fine print that you scroll through when buying a ticket says
8. Understand that at this point, the passenger had had his ticket revoked and was no longer legally permitted on the plane. The doctor was disobeying gate agent orders and the gate agents need him to be off the plane. The gate agents were *not in the wrong* for calling airport police in this situation, because airport police are responsible for removing unruly passengers. Again, the doctor was, technically, trespassing. The gate agents clearly couldn't remove him so they had no other choice. 
9. By this point, I believe the passenger is at fault. When police officers are ordering you to get off of the plane, at some point you should. At this point, it's a maturity thing. The man was a highly educated doctor and *should have known* what would happen if he continued to disobey the airport police. I know this sounds like a ""Citizen, pick up that can"" kind of moment, but by the contract that the passenger agreed to, he needed to leave. This could happen anywhere. He should have gotten off of the plane, collected his money, and pursued other means to legally punish UAL for booting him. He wasn't losing any rights, he probably wouldn't have been arrested (More likely received a stern lecture), but he continued to resist the officer's direct orders.
10. This is where the Airport Police fuck up severely. From the video you can *clearly* see that the officer loses his patience and forcefully drags the doctor out of his seat. The officer leaves the arm rests down and yanks the doctor across the row and out into the aisle. This is a gross overuse of force by the police. The doctor was not violently resisting, but he was treated with violence and seriously injured in the process. Getting knocked unconcious happens all of the time in movies, TV shows, etc. But it's actually a *huge* deal and requires a lot of medical attention to ensure that a TBI hasn't occured. The officer also dragged him out of the plane by his arms, which is the wrong way to move an unconscious individual due to the risk of causing further damage. 
11. The fact that the doctor managed to get back onto the plane indicates that the police officers did not immediately call for medical assistance or continue to properly detain the doctor once he regained consciousness. This is, again, a colossal fuckup on their part, because it demonstrates that they probably did not follow any real sort of procedure once they got the guy off of the plane. Unfortunately, we don't have footage of what happened, but it is apparent that they straight up left the guy lying on the ground and stopped attending him long enough for him to stumble down the gate and back on to the plane unhindered. As I mentioned, if you watch the video, the doctor is *clearly* exhibiting signs of a concussion. 
12. The plane was delayed for a couple of hours due to the actions of the gate agents and the police. 

So here are the major issues *I* have with the whole event.

* Airline policies that permit pretty awful treatment of passengers, including overbooking and involuntary removal, and policies where the ""best"" solution was to boot paying customers for crew logistical reasons. That's poor planning and the airline should have found a better way to ferry the crew.

* Gate agents are given a lot of power. Sometimes they use this to help passengers, but they also can inconvenience everyone as they did here. The gate agents should *not* have boarded the plane until they had room for everyone, and they could have given the doctor leeway to fly on the plane given his extenuating circumstances. 

* The doctor should have deboarded when the first airport police officer arrived. At that point, he should have known he wasn't going to win, and frankly I agree with the assertion by the former Continental CEO that the doctor was being immature at that point. He would have been handsomely compensated and as other people have mentioned, it would not have been difficult to rent a car and drive to Louisville, or to book a later flight with another airline, or to have taken a train, or a bus... I've had flights cancelled on me before, and in one instance I split a car rental with a few other passengers and we drove to our destination. 

* The airport police were obscenely out of line with how they handled the situation. From violently removing the passenger, to causing a serious head injury, to literally *dragging* him off of the plane, to leaving him on the floor of the airport without treatment or supervision. No part of their handling of the matter was ok. The officers should have lifted the arm rests and pulled the passenger out and escorted him off. Violence was absolutely the wrong answer.

So; my long-winded rant is out of the way. What do you guys think of the situation? What could the airline/crew/doctor/police have done better? Who do you think could be assigned blame here? How does this affect your opinion of UAL? "

A few weeks back a friend of mine noticed that United Airlines had a round-trip flight (same-day) from San Francisco (SFO) to Chicago's O'Hare (ORD) for $120 on a Boeing 747-400. Being a younger aviation enthusiast who had never been on a 747 (and who may not fly one again, considering the fact that many airlines are thinking about getting rid of them), I nabbed the ticket, along with a few other friends. Our group was a bunch of aviation majors from San Jose State, and most of us had not flown in a 747 before. 

Yesterday (04/19/2016) we left a beautiful, sunny SFO at about 0900 local time and spent about 3 hours on United Flight UA620. The on-board WiFi was down most of the time, but the views were great, the drinks were refreshing, and everyone in our group was pretty psyched to be there. We landed in Chicago around 1500 local time, and, with about 45 minutes to spare, we grabbed some Chicago deep-dish pizza, a Chicago-style hot dog, and a cold beer inside Terminal C (the one that's connected to the rest of the airport by a tunnel). 

Around 1545 we boarded the 747 once again (Flight UA1213) and spent another 3 hours returning home. Our flight both ways was pretty smooth, and the plane itself, though older, was fairly comfortable. Once we landed in SFO at around 1800 local time, I asked the flight attendant if we could take a look inside the cockpit and the upper deck, to which she happily replied ""Yes"". The upper deck was smaller than I thought, but the seats looked like super-comfy recliners. You could tell that the cockpit was pretty old by the brown-colored, retro-styled design (unfortunately we couldn't take pictures). Yet the avionics were all glass, and despite what looked like a Flight Engineer's station, no FE was needed.

All-in-all, our group had a great time, and only later that evening did it hit me that, in less than 12 hours, we had traveled all the way from San Francisco to Chicago and back...for pizza, beer, and hot dogs. God Bless America!!!

(Link to a few photos from the trip: http://imgur.com/a/X7jQT) 

(Bonus points if you know the cities in the pics!)

Edit: it was brought to my attention that the 747-400 never needed a flight engineer. That is correct- it was designed for a 2-person crew. My mistake. Yet in the cockpit was what looked like an engineer's station, completely empty of instrumentation. Maybe it was there for additional equipment that was no longer needed?"
"2014-07-10 01:41:52"|"My mother reached 30 years of service with United today..."|"So, I got a text from my mother today. She let me know that she just found out that today is her 30th anniversary with United. I asked if they did anything for her. She told me no. I asked how she found out. I thought at least a manager of some sort had come up and congratulated her on her 30 years with the company. She said that she only found out through payroll. Since the company merged it seems that they do not really seem to care. So I thought, this should not stand. I cannot make the airline recognize her service and devotion to the company that she once loved. But maybe I can do something. My mother has long loved the old United posters for Hawaii, I was thinking I could get one of the posters that she does not own yet. But I thought, that's not enough. I wanted to maybe find someone who can sign the poster for her. Since Walter Varney (founder of United) died in my mothers home town of Santa Barbara back in 1968 and could not find out much more info on any founders I was running out of ideas. But then, I came across an article on Ron Akana. This guy is the oldest living flight attendant and has flown with United for over 60 years! He is also from Hawaii and I figured this guy would be great! But then I hit a snag. I cannot find any contact info for this fine gentleman. This is where I hope that you guys all come in. Anyone know where I can get a hold of him? Contact email or a publicist? Also, any other ideas on people I may be able to contact to try and get an epic signature for my mom for her 30 years of service.

Obligatory ""I come from a military family"" statement. I enjoy the structured life mainly. You have one job and you do it. You get fed, housed, and some nice benefits. Also, military aircraft are pretty badass. (Some civilian aircraft are badass as well).

I've done what others have told me: talk to pilots, military personnel, congressmen, senators, ex-Pilots. I've gained a great bit of information and I've decided it's right for me. **I am not going to let someone else's experiences ruin my own**

Here is a little more info on the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370. If I have missed any information or gotten anything drastically wrong please let me know and I will edit accordingly.

**What we know:**


**8/3/2014**

(All times GMT+8)

00:42:00 - Malaysian Airlines flight 370, registration [9M-MRO](https://imgur.com/lFJ1UFm), departs Kuala Lumpur Intl. Airport with 239 on board.

08:19:37 - A log-on acknowledgement is received from flight 370. This is the last data received from the flight.




**15/3/2014**

The search area shifts to the southern Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Australia. A robotic submarine searched the seabed for pings from the flight data recorders (FDR) until May 28.



**17/3/2014**

The Australian Government takes lead of the search for the missing flight. Co-ordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the search will be focused on an area of 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 square miles).

This search will continue, in varying intensities, until January 2017.



**29/7/2015**

The [right flaperon of a Boeing 777-200ER](https://imgur.com/Jk69EW4) is found on R?union Island. On August 5, this flaperon would be confirmed to have come from 9M-MRO, making it the first conclusive wreckage found.



**23/3/2016**

A fragment of a [Rolls-Royce engine cowling](https://imgur.com/ET7ax0s) and a [folding table from an aircraft cabin](https://imgur.com/76HxOeA) was found on a beach in South Africa. On May 12, these would be confirmed as having come from 9M-MRO.



**17/1/2017**

Australia, Malaysia and China jointly announce the suspension of the search.



**17/10/2017**

Malaysia receives a proposal from Ocean Infinity to continue the search for the aircraft. A few days later, they release a press statement announcing that they have accepted the offer.



**23/1/2018**

[Ocean Infinity resumes the search for the aircraft.](https://oceaninfinity.com/mh370/)



**Theories**

There are countless theories about what happened to flight 370, I will be looking at the most plausible ones.


**Pilot Suicide**

From the day that the Malaysian authorities announced that the captain had flown similar flights on his home simulator, the media have been circulating the idea that the loss of flight 370 was a suicide mission. A document released by Malaysian police confirmed that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah had a built a quite in-depth simulator in his home. Officials were able to extract data from Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and each data point had information about the simulated aircrafts altitude, speed, direction and a number of key parameters.

The statement from the Malaysian Government reads:

>Search officials believe MH370 followed a similar route, based on signals the plane transmitted to a satellite after ceasing communications and turning off course. The actual and the simulated flights were not identical, though, with the simulated endpoint some 900 miles from the remote patch of southern ocean area where officials believe the plane went down. Based on the data in the document, [here's a map of the simulated flight compared to the route searchers believe the lost airliner followed](https://imgur.com/5VBZzEg).

However, after his disappearance, friends and family members came forward to described Zaharie as ""an affable, helpful family man who enjoyed making instructional YouTube videos"" - hardly the typical profile of a mass murderer.



**Fire onboard**

Fires onboard aircraft are not all that uncommon. Fires have been known to cause the demise of aircraft in the past, but the fact that flight 370 flew for nearly *7 hours* without making a mayday call leads experts to believe that this is not the case. While fires can engulf an aircraft quickly, they rarely leave no time to contact air traffic control.

The leading fire theory speculates that ""A fire, possibly electrical or from an overheated tyre on take-off, sent smoke into the cockpit shortly after the crew signed off with Malaysian air traffic controllers.""

However this theory fails when one is reminded of the ping detected by satellite at 08:11:00 on the morning of March 8. According to analysis provided by the Malaysian and United States governments, the pings narrowed the location of MH370 at that moment to one of two arcs, one in Central Asia and the other in the southern Indian Ocean. As MH370 flew on its original course toward it was headed toward neither. Without human intervention it simply could not have reached the position we know it attained at 8:11 a.m



**Hijacking**

When an aircraft deviates thousands of miles from its intended course, of course a hijacking comes to mind. Since the 9/11 attacks though, numerous measures have been taken to ensure that would-be hijackers are denied access to the cockpit, let alone take control of the aircraft. The 777, just like every other commercial airliner, is fitted with a security door, blocking anyone except the flight crew from entering the flight deck. In an interview, a 777 captain has this to say about the cockpit door security measures:

>There is a door code you can enter which only the crew know, or you can press a doorbell, which prompts the crew inside the flight deck to check the camera and monitor screen to check who is trying to access the flight deck. The door and the locking mechanism are incredibly strong, bulletproof, and once locked nobody will be able to break the door down.



**Rothschild Patent Inheritance**

Freescale Semiconductor, a US technology company, had 20 of its employees on board flight 370. The right to a patent of a product, recently released by the company, was shared five ways - 20% to Freescale Semiconductor, and 20% each to four of the employees on board. This resulted in the billionaire Jacob Rothschild being the sole owner of the important patent.


**Diego Garcia**

Another extremely prominent theory is that flight 370 was hijacked and diverted to a United States military base on the atoll of Diego Garcia. The pilot had allegedly practiced landing on a short runway in the Indian Ocean on his flight simulator. Several residents of nearby islands reported that they saw a 'low flying jumbo jet' around 06:15:00 on March 8. They said that it was a white aircraft, with red stripes across it, keeping with Malaysian Airlines livery at the time of the incident. 

A resident of Kudahuvadhoo described the scene:

> ""I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly.""

Discovery of the flaperon on R?union Island has renewed the speculation that flight 370 was shot down near Diego Garcia.




**What now?**

Following the fourth anniversary of the aircrafts disappearance, Malaysian officials have announced that there will be a press release this evening. I will update this post with any new information when it is available.

by Antony Woodward"|"In this article I will discuss the steps you need to take to achieve a private pilot?s license in 4 weeks or less. You will see that with the right mindset and a few pre-requisites this goal is entirely realistic and will have the added benefit of saving you a lot of money while bolstering your self confidence and self esteem. 

Regulatory requirements for private pilot licenses vary from one country to another but in general a minimum of 40 hours of flying is required, a written or computerised test of aeronautical knowledge, and a flight test. A medical certificate is also required. 

Although I have held licenses from several ICAO member states, I have done most of my flying on validations of my FAA license. Therefore, I will talk about the aeronautical knowledge, skill, and experience requirements to obtain an FAA private pilot?s license in the United States. Federal Aviation Regulations Part 61 Certification of Pilots and Flight Instructors state that an applicant must meet the following requirements:

?	Be at least 17 years old
?	Be able to read, speak, write and understand the English language.
?	Obtain at least a third class medical certificate from an Aviation Medical Examiner
?	Pass a computerized aeronautical knowledge test
?	Accumulate and log a specified amount of training and experience, including the following:
?	At least 40 hours of flight time, including 20 hours with an instructor and 10 hours of solo flight.
?	5 hours of solo cross-country time including one flight of at least 150 nautical miles with full stop landings at a minimum of three points
?	Three solo takeoffs and landings to a full stop at an airport with an operating control tower.
?	3 hours of night flight training and 10 takeoffs and landings to a full stop at an airport.
?	3 hours of instrument flying training.
?	Pass an oral and flight test administered by an FAA inspector or FAA designated examiner.

A private pilot?s license allows command of any aircraft (subject to appropriate ratings) for any non-commercial purpose, and gives almost unlimited authority to fly under visual flight rules (VFR). Passengers may be carried and flight in furtherance of a business is permitted. However, a private pilot may not be compensated in any way for services as a pilot, although passengers can pay a pro rata share of flight expenses, such as fuel or rental costs.

Many people, for one reason or another, qualify for a private pilot?s license over an extended period of many months. This leads to a blowout in training costs. Then there is another group of people who like to accomplish their objectives in the minimum amount of time possible. Here is an outline of the procedure for those wishing to qualify for a pilot?s license in four weeks or less:

?	Obtain at least a third class medical certificate from an Aviation Medical Examiner. The medical certificate you will receive is also a student pilot?s license which allows you to start flight training immediately.
?	Buy a comprehensive ground school course which you can study at home on your computer.
?	When you are doing well on the practice tests and are feeling confident, make an appointment at your local Flight Service District Office to take the computerized aeronautical knowledge test.
?	After passing the test contact Fixed Base Operators at your local airport, ask for a quotation, and tell them that you have a student pilot?s licence/medical certificate, and that you have passed the aeronautical knowledge test and that you wish to complete your flight training in four weeks. 

If you come across a training outfit that tells you this is not possible, move on until you find a flying school with a positive and supportive attitude. You should also make it clear that you will be available to fly every day, weather permitting. 

There will be a few days that you cannot get airborne because of adverse weather. This presents an ideal  opportunity to revise certain areas of your ground course. You could also familiarize yourself with the Airplane Flight Manual for the aircraft you are flying. Many of the questions asked in the FAA oral examination are about the aircraft?s systems and performance. The other obvious reason for doing this is that you need to be knowledgeable about the systems and performance of the aircraft you are flying. 

?	This scenario assumes that you are able to finance the total cost of the flying and that you have 4 weeks available. Realistically you should allow for a 10% overrun. That is, budget on doing 44 hours of flying instead of the minimum 40 hours as specified in the FARs (Federal Aviation Regulations). The national average in the U.S. is 60+ hours. One of the reasons for this is that people flying only 1 or 2 hours a week lose currency which results in them having to repeat maneuvers in order to satisfy their instructor. 
?	If we assume that adverse weather keeps you on the ground for 20% of the 28 days you have projected, that means that you will be flying 44 hours in 22 days. That equates to only 2 hours flying per day on average. This is eminently achievable and more particularly because you will not have the stress of preparing for the aeronautical knowledge exam which you would have already passed  before stepping into an airplane. You are free to concentrate on the flying! I know from my own experience that concentrated flying results in a rapid development of self confidence.

Some years ago I was living on the Italian Riviera where I had the good fortune to meet an Italian crop dusting pilot who was spraying vineyards in Piemonte in northern Italy. He held an FAA commercial pilot?s licence with an Italian validation. He very kindly gave me the textbooks that he had used to get his commercial pilot licence at Ag Aviation Academy in Reno, Nevada. I studied the textbooks assiduously every day for about two months during the summer of 1969.  

When I believed I knew the subjects well enough I flew to Frankfurt where I took an FAA first class medical examination. My medical certificate was also a student pilot?s license. It was during the Frankfurt Book Fair and there were no hotel rooms available. At the main railway station I was lucky enough to meet a train driver who rented me a room, and whose wife provided me with some good German food. 

The next day I went to the Rhein Main Air Base where the FAA District office for Europe and the Middle East was located. I showed the FAA inspector my medical certificate and student license and told him that I wished to take the commercial pilot written examination. I had zero hours flight time but they weren?t concerned about that.  They gave me the exam paper, told me I had six hours to complete it, and showed me into the testing room. At that time pocket calculators could not be used. Basic arithmetic was the norm for figuring out the weight and balance questions. I struggled for the full six hours then flew back to Italy to wait for the Airman Test Report.  

After a couple of weeks of high anxiety I finally received my report with a passing score which was mainly due to good luck in getting the right questions rather than any innate ability on my part. The following week I enrolled in a CAA approved 35 hour PPL (private pilot license) course at Southend-on-Sea  at the mouth of the Thames river in the United Kingdom.  The technical papers were not too difficult because they were at a lower standard than the FAA commercial pilot written examination that I had just taken in Frankfurt. 

Most days the weather was not good with low cloud bases and precipitation ? typical late autumn weather in the U.K! This meant having to deviate from the course line I had drawn on my chart to stay clear of clouds and in so doing risk getting lost. Most of the time I found it was relatively easy to pick up railway lines, roads, reservoirs etc. to help get back on track. There were a couple of instances where I became disorientated while flying to grass airfields with no nearby navaids. My instructor told me that cross country flying at the PPL level was supposed to be done by pilotage, that is by looking out the window and identifying objects on the ground, rather than by reference to radio navigation aids. It was all very well for him to say that as he had an intimate knowledge of the area, whereas I was seeing it for the first time in marginal weather. Airports such as Biggin Hill had a chaotic traffic pattern with tiger moths over from the Tiger Club in Red Hill spinning on the base leg and metal everywhere going in all directions. The  airfield was probably more orderly during the Battle of Britain with a couple of spitfire squadrons.   

I had some difficulty on the long triangular solo cross-country flight which was one of the requirements for the license. On the last leg from Biggin Hill to Southend I encounterd a strong crosswind on landing and had to go around. During the go-around I flew over a cemetery which did nothing to ease my anxiety. On the second attempt I crabbed to a touchdown and nearly sheared off the landing gear. The problem was that because the training was taking place so rapidly, my instructor hadn?t got around to giving me any instruction in crosswind landing techniques, and I had no idea how to do a cross controlled forward slip. 

The problem with my GFT (general flying test) was that they rolled out an aircraft I?d never flown before ? a fully aerobatic Beagle Pup with a joystick. It didn?t give me any joy! The examiner commented that he would make allowances for the fact that I?d never flown the Beagle Pup. After I had completed the required maneuvers including spin recovery, he took over the controls and demonstrated the limits of the flight envelope. By the time he?d finished barrel rolling around clouds and performing chandelles all over the sky, I was feeling quite nauseous and regretting having eaten that steak and kidney pie closely followed by an apple turnover with fresh cream. I knew the flight had been satisfactory because he sent one of the instructors into London with the paperwork and an application for the licence. 

I started training on October 31, 1969 and took my GFT at Southend-on-Sea airfield on November 10, 1969. Total time logged was 37 hours and 25 minutes. The only reason I mention this is to show that if an average person, who is not afraid of a little hard work, can complete a private pilot?s license in 11 days then you should have no difficulty in doing the same thing in 28 days, especially in a place with fairly decent weather.

I know this is a wall of words, but read it anyway ... it contains several suggestions for improvement.

My current work assignment is a full time technology consulting project in Houston, so each week I fly round trip from my home base in Minneapolis. My return flight on Feb 22-23 was interesting, to say the least: https://weather.com/news/weather/video/united-flight-skids-off-icy-runway-in-green-bay-wisconsin

Yes, I recorded the video clips and that?s my voice you hear. The Weather Channel did a nice job editing and adding dramatic music. But that just shows the icing on the cake. There's a lot more to it.

My timeline of events:

We boarded United flight 878 IAH (Bush Intercontinental) to MSP on Thursday, February 22, 2018 about 7:10 pm with a scheduled departure of 7:40 pm.

The flight was nearly full, a Boeing 737-900 with 200 people on board. I was wedged into 21E, a middle seat in an exit row, between two guys who weigh 300-400 pounds. I?m not exactly svelte either, but these guys made me look small.

I showed the people around me how to turn off the seat-back entertainment units that would otherwise be flashing annoying DirecTV ads for the entire flight. Protip: Hit the minus button that dims the screen until it reaches its lowest setting. Every flight should include these instructions. Little did I know we?d be glued to those little screens long after midnight.

We sat for about 30 minutes, then the pilot announced there was a mechanical problem and ?this plane won?t be going to Minneapolis?. The crew instructed us to get off and await instructions for a plane change. The United app notifications told me it was a problem with air conditioning. (8:15 pm)

I begged the counter agent to let me pay to upgrade to one of the several empty first class seats. Travel policy doesn?t allow reimbursement for this, but I?d gladly eat the $79 cost of the upgrade I'd been offered in the United app when I checked in. ?Sorry. We have to keep them empty because the plane isn?t balanced.? My brother does weight-and-balance verification for another airline, so I understand this can happen. My brother later told me this is typically done when the aft baggage compartments are out of service or very lightly loaded with low-density cargo like flowers (he calls this a ?fluffy load?). He also told me that when there is a plane change, he re-plans the loading of the plane from scratch. If those bins were not loaded due to a mechanical problem with the first plane, the load plan should have been revised for the second one.

Gate change. Checked again to see if maybe those first class seats were available, but no. Boarded plane #2 and pushed off. Same seat, between the same two guys. Because we were seated in an exit row, the flight attendants must ask us if we are willing and able to open the emergency exit door. The same attendant asked the same questions on both planes. The second time around, I jokingly asked her ?If I were to say ?No?, would you move me to one of those empty seats in first class?? She furrowed her brow like a scolding school teacher and said ?No, then we?d have to open the door.? We all laughed and I said, ?In that case, I?m a ?Yes?.?

Plane departed IAH about 9:10 pm.

The tall 400 pound guy in 21D, who needed a seatbelt extender and spilled into my seat, said ?You know you are kind of hot? (referring to my body temperature). I reply, ?Thanks, I have my moments.? He?s actually a nice guy from Mississippi on his way to MN for a probate court hearing in the morning to settle the affairs of a relative who had passed away. Spoiler alert: he won?t make it to the hearing. I recall him advising us not to die without a will. Prophetic?

Scheduled arrival time at MSP was 10:40 pm but at that time we were somewhere over Iowa. I had slept for an hour, and that power nap served me well through the adventure that was coming our way.

The plane arrived in MSP airspace at the height of a snowstorm (~11:15 pm)

Aborted landing attempt #1 and we circled for what felt like an hour.

The plane?s seat-back entertainment units include a map and shows altitude and speed; I switched mine on out of curiosity. I wasn?t feeling very comfortable about all this low-altitude flying in icing conditions. Pilot announced we were running low on fuel and were diverting about 200 miles to Madison WI for fuel. (~ midnight)

The landing in Madison seemed harsher than average with loud landing gear noise and some twisting (crosswind correction?) at touchdown. Not the worst I?ve experienced, by far, but enough of a jolt to make a seasoned traveler go ?Huh??

Best part of the night ? after we landed in Madison, the 400 pound guy in 21D jumped to the front of the plane and sat in one of the unoccupied first class seats. Nobody said a word and he stayed there for the duration of the flight! (Friday morning, ~1:00 am)

After refueling, pilot announced he has to be back in the air within 35 minutes or FAA rules will ground him and we?ll be stuck in Madison. My phone?s weather.com radar forecast showed the storm wouldn?t be clearing MSP until after 4:00 am, I recall thinking this might not end well.

We flew 200+ miles back to MN, circled some more, and aborted landing attempt #2. Pilot announced that runway conditions left braking distances too long for safety, so we were done for the night and diverting to Green Bay (it is now roughly 2:30 am)

My immediate thought: ""Why are we flying EAST? The storm is heading east. Shouldn't we be pointing at Des Moines or Omaha?"" Steady rain fell in Green Bay on frozen ground. Glare ice formed. There?s little-to-no air traffic at that time of night to report conditions.

If the pilot thought braking distances at MSP were bad, he sure had a nasty surprise waiting in Wisconsin.

During landing, touchdown was quite smooth. But I heard the thrust reversers at full throttle MUCH longer than normal and I also noticed the complete absence of the usual sounds, vibrations, and deceleration of brakes. I recall thinking ?Wow we?re using every bit of runway.? Then there were some mild bumps (like a car going over speed humps). The guy on my right looks out the window and said ?Holy shit, were in the weeds!? I later learned we stopped 250 feet past the end of the runway. It was a flat and grassy field, and the ground was frozen solid. The plane wasn?t quite perfectly level, just a slight slant to the right. (3:15 am)

Pilot announced that we had left the runway and would be staying put. Stairs and a bus had been requested. It is going to be a while. A few passengers stood in the aisle, nobody seemed to be injured or even terribly upset. Emergency vehicles arrived on the left (port) side of the plane. The guy on my left said ""I am a huge Vikings fan. Why Green Bay of all places?""

I submitted reports to the news tip lines of two Minneapolis TV stations. A reporter from KARE (NBC affiliate in Minneapolis) immediately called me. I sent him video clips showing calm passengers and flashing lights outside, and he recorded an audio interview. His report was forwarded to NBC News and to their Houston affiliate KHOU.

Plane is unloaded. The bus had a capacity of 60, so it took at least four trips to get everyone to the terminal. I was in the second group. I recorded a clip from the staircase and sent it to KARE (5:00 am).

Crowd control was excellent at the plane, nobody could possibly wander off. At the terminal, we were free to roam and people were scattered throughout the terminal. One suggestion would be to announce a gathering spot in baggage claim where passengers can hear announcements. Fortunately it isn't a very large airport.

200 passengers milled around 2+ hours waiting for baggage and further instructions. United called in help and they handed out cinnamon rolls and bagel/egg sandwiches. I high-fived the 400 pound guy from Mississippi for having the nerve to sit in first class. I receive messages requesting permission to use my video clips, which I granted to anyone who asked nicely (free, perpetual, and unlimited use ? sure, why not?). I was interviewed by Brandi -- you cannot make this stuff up -- Smith at KHOU, and she put together a nice segment for their morning news show. http://www.khou.com/article/news/local/houston-flight-to-minn-slides-off-runway-in-green-bay/285-522392079

About 8:00 am we were given the choice between a 5-6 hour bus ride to MSP or a hotel room for the morning followed by a 1:00 pm flight. I took the hotel and flight option, but 2/3 of the other passengers went for the bus. (Riding a bus across icy northern Wisconsin seemed particularly silly to me. Planes are much safer.) . I was issued a room voucher, $10 meal voucher, and a boarding pass. The hotel shuttle driver told me he was called in at 4:00 am and the hotel was expecting a much larger group; my guess is that United?s dispatcher tipped off the two nearby hotels to get ready for the full inbound jet before the runway excursion.

I slept for about two hours then returned to the airport at noon for the 1:00 pm flight. United sent what seemed to be a brand spanking new 737-900 to Green Bay to pick about 60 of us up. The cabin crew looked younger than usual (newbies that just finishing training?) but quite professional and polished. I had an entire row to myself. The weather was clear. The flight attendant didn?t ask for my credit card when I ordered a beer.

United has offered me the choice of a $300 flight credit that expires in a year or 15k miles. The text from the apology on the customer care site is below. Do you notice something missing? Zero acknowledgement that the plane left the runway. Zero acknowledgement that a mechanical problem with the first plane caused us to fly into the worst of the storm. Sure the weather was involved, but there was plenty of poor efforts that contributed. I think I'll pass on this offer.

?We Apologize

I can understand your concern when inclement weather forced your flight to divert to Madison rather than continuing to Minneapolis/St. Paul, as scheduled. Once we were given clearance to depart for Minneapolis and were en-route, I understand that, due to further weather conditions, an additional diversion to Green Bay was required and the flight subsequently cancelled.

Your safety is always important to us. I trust our staff was attentive to your needs and able to work with you in a pleasant, quick, and organized manner to offer alternate arrangements to get you safely to your final destination.?

But on the bright side, I survived a plane crash.

p.s. Hey United, the seat belt extender you gave the guy in 21D somehow wound up in my computer bag. May I keep it as a souvenir? Otherwise, you can come pick it up. I am usually home on Fridays."
"2019-05-22 20:29:23"|"The Sukhoi Superjet 100 has been a failure for both Sukhoi and Russia"|"I been following the Superjet 100 since the plane was unvelied in 2008.  I cannot stress how important this project is for not just Sukhoi but Russia. The Sukhoi Superjet also called the SSJ was supposed to be the return of Russia to the civilian aviation sector after the collapse of the Soviet Union ( the Irkut project was started earlier but could not be produced until next year). However the SSJ platform has been plagued with problems and its tragic maiden press tour and recent crash has not helped it all. One of the biggest reasons for the failure of the SSJ has been its fucking horrendous engine the [Sam146](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerJet_SaM146). You see when the SSJ was announced NPO Saturn was chosen as the engine manufacturer. However NPO Saturn did not posses the technical capacity to make civilian high bypass turbo fan engines. So they partnered up with a French company called Snecma which was to build the high bypass part of the engine. [Well unfortunately for Sukhoi Snecma really screwed up their part of the production](https://www.airway1.com/almost-all-ssj100s-from-interjet-are-on-the-ground/). **The SaM146 problems occur in the so-called hot part of the engine, where fuel is burned. Cracks appear in the combustion chambers or oil collectors after 2000?4000 flight hours, and sometimes after 1000 flight hours. The engine must be sent to overhaul then although the manufacturer promises that the engine should run 7500-8000 hours before the first major overhaul.**

Azimut Airlines' three Superjet 100 out of eight have already suffered from the engine flaws, despite those three aircraft were new ones and have been in operation since September 2017. The other five copies joined the airline's fleet in 2018.

The experts don't know why those cracks occur so quickly. Safran manufactures engines for other aircraft. But the problem is only with the SaM146, although the suppliers of components are the same as for the rest of the product line.

**Repair of a failed engine costs from two to five million dollars and lasts around two months. Since this is a design flaw, the manufacturer repairs the engine at its own expense. But the airline itself pays for the rental of the replacement engine.**

&#x200B;

**Right now the situation is so bad that Sukhoi actually looses money if you buy and fly one of their planes.** Since cracks in the engine are appearing sometimes as low as 1,000 hours and since the engines are defective from the factory Sukhoi is responsible for their repairs.  So if you buy a SSJ100 and fly it around enough in a couple of months Sukhoi would have to do millions of dollars of repairs on it. 

&#x200B;

This is also hurting the airlines because the plane is completely out of commission while these repairs are being made. So you could have your entire SSJ fleet grounded. This has happened to their biggest customer outside the USSR which was the Mexican airline Interjet. They had 15 of their 22 planes grounded and now are selling their entire fleet. Sukhoi itself is not even manufacturing the plane anymore instead they are just focused on fixing the existing models.  But Sukhoi itself is pretty screwed because **the engines are failing in the part that was not manufactured or designed by them so they have no idea how to even approach the issue.**  While Smecma is just shrugging putting their hands up in the air and pointing the finger at Sukhoi. 

&#x200B;

The program has caused Sukhoi to loose a lot of money and right now United Aircraft Corporation only hope is to get to the bottom of the engine repairs while flooding the market with parts in the hopes that when breakdowns do happen spares are easy to get to and the aircraft can be back up and flying again soon."

"2018-04-10 14:29:31"|"Question: About maximum speed of civilian aircraft."|"Hello everyone,

I'm currently monitoring a flight that my girlfriend is on. But I've noticed that the speed of her aircraft is much higher than planned. She is flying on a Boeing 777-200 with United Airlines. Her planned speed is 876 km/h, but currently the airplane is cruising at 10.350m at a speed of 1145 km/h. A quick google shows that the max speed for a 777 is about 950 km/h. 

Is the increase in speed due to a tailwind? Does UA fit afterburners to their 777's? Especially since mach 1 is so close at 1234 km/h, wouldn't their current speed put a lot of stress on the airplane? Or is the extra stress mitigated by the increase in altitude? The planned altitude was also much lower, at 8.850m. 

I've experienced this higher speed while being on aircraft myself, but I've never passed 1.100 km/h. But then again, perhaps there is a difference in listed aircraft speed and ground speed? Basically, I'm wondering if the listed airspeed on flight monitoring websites and apps account for velocity, or if it is true groundspeed.

Thanks for any help!"

First, how safe is it to have the clueless flight attendants flying divert to an ALT?

Second, is it even worth it to have them change frequencies UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY such as leaving a center to approach where it would most likely be the final freq change?

Heres how I would handle it.

We would request the attendants to forget checklists, and simply focus on flying. We would let autopilot and FMC handle the entire approach and landing. We would have them somehow find their way (after god knows how long and also pray they do this all BEFORE T/D), set their MCP altitude all the way down to 0 right away because lets face it we do NOT want them having to constantly switch the ALTITUDE on the MCP or theyll mess it up or lose focus, and let VNAV do the descent. Just for fun we'd ask them while they're at FL370 ""United 209 what is your speed"" ""omg we are going I thinkkk. it says we're going 250 miles per hour"" and we will sort of laugh because lets face it it would take them a full week course to learn knots and especially IAS. Modern airliners have auto speed restrictions set to below 250 at or below 10,000. We would not want to give them ANY radar vectors unless unlucky for us and more for the attendants, the final downwind leg may have vectors in which in that case we'd have them use the FMC to fly Direct to the base leg. As soon as they hit below 10,000 we'd ask them to slowly reduce speed to 210 and set flaps to 15. once they are downwind nearing base, we'd have them set speed to VREF for landing PLUS 30, set flaps to 20 (this is for Boeing as for Airbus the flap settings would be different but similar), and gears down right away to put that out of the way. We'd then let the LNAV turn to Final and have them punch in Localizer, set speed to VREF plus 5, and then select approach. Oh and wed sort of instruct them and hope they dont mess up arming speedbrakes for landing, and then set Autobrakes to MAX and upon landing NO REVERSE THRUST, stop on the runway because God forbid we trust them to exit the runway so lets just shut down the whole airport because they cannot do one small thing without messing it up, and hopefully when they come to a full stop after shitting on the brakes, we'd wait 2 more hours until they find the engine cutoff switches and shut the engine down (hoping the flight attendants dont quickly open doors and jump right into the runway with engines running. And I think thats how we could save the plane, which makes me think we really need remote control for planes.

But ATC or pilots advising via radio how would you guys handle this? I would say the less radar vectors and the more FMC the better."

However, due to a medical issue I was denied a pilot slot but was still able to have an aviation job working with military pilots. Well, 5 years later and the medical issue is no longer a factor, I got my flying medical, applied for pilot training and got selected! I'm tentatively leaving for pilot training in November. 

Now here's the rub and why I'm looking for advice. In the past year my attitude towards being in the military took a sharp nosedive and now the thought of being committed to the air force for another 10-15 years is pretty daunting. I work with a lot of reservists who fly with my unit and also for the airlines as their day jobs and they all say flying in the civilian sector is a hundred times better than in the military, and talking to them has really made me consider doing civilian flying. So now I'm wondering if it'll really be worth it to go to military pilot training or if it would be more worth wild to ride out my commitment to June 2021, and then go to a civilian pilot school and become a pilot that way. 

Pros about the military path: guaranteed job for the next 10-15 years, free training, sets up for success to fly in the civilian world. Cons: Rough on family, lots of additional non-flying related duties, shorter window before I'm flying a desk (I estimate only about 3-5 years of line flying before I'm put in a supervisory role). 

Pros about civilian path: No deployments! Primarily fly (minimal non-flying responsibilities), avoid military queep. Cons: starting over from the bottom (again), have to pay for flight training, poor opportunities for freshly minted pilots, lose military benefits (healthcare, housing, etc).

 

So that's where I'm at right now. Crossroads of life with two very valid but very different paths to take. Each with their own pros and cons, and no clear cut better decision. Anyone deal with something similar who can offer advice? Or can think of something that I'm overlooking or getting wrong? I'm about 2 months away from signing any commitment paperwork so I just want to make sure I make the right decision."

There's a couple of things I couldn't find when we tried googling them. So I though I'll ask you guys.


1. How much would an auxiliary power unit for a commercial airliner cost?


2. How much does an auxiliary heating unit cost for a commercial plane?

3. And also how much does the cleaning and catering cost? And if you could also tell me about how airlines generally handle these.

4. Do any of you have any experience with a flight route business model? I'd just like to ask some questions about how they're supposed to be structured. 

Thank you!"

I honestly don't see why the 1549 emergency landing was a big deal. I mean other than the fact that ditching airplanes in water is *unusual* and therefore kind of interesting. But this aircraft is designed to ditch in water in case of emergency. There was an emergency, and they did.

So why is the captain a ""hero"". Is that just media hype or was there actually something amazing that occurred that I am not getting?

So I don't fly a whole lot, but enough to have noticed something.  I noticed that when flying some of the big name common airlines (AA, United, etc), they seem to have a ""no rush"" approach to getting in the air.  Board the plane, wait a while.  Oh look we missed our departure time and we're not even out of the terminal yet.  Then we finally get on the tarmac and are sitting there in the worlds longest line before finally taking off.  

On the alternative, in my experience with Southwest they seem to be much more hustle.  As soon as everyone is on board the doors are closed and pilots are pulling away before the flight attendants even had a chance to say their spiel.  Hardly ever wait on the tarmac and typically round the final turn without even stopping before going airborne.  

Now I know this probably isn't a uniquely Southwest thing, given that air traffic and all kinds of other factors play into account, but is there something going on behind the scenes here that I'm missing?  

Again not trying to call any airlines out in particular, I'm sure Southwest has their share of delays and crap too.  "

> To whom it may concern,

> I understand the need to have company policies that insulate United Airlines from potential lawsuits, but exceptions should be made under certain circumstances. 

> Everyone is different, and bladders fill at different rates. Today, my bladder filled faster than anticipated (despite having relieved myself just prior to boarding). I waited as long as I could for the seat belt sign to be turned off, but my situation was becoming urgent. With my bladder status bordering on ?emergency?, I saw a first class passenger use the forward lavatory with the seat belt sign still on. Since someone else had broached the subject first, I thought I was ok to try and use the bathroom. Both aft lavatories were occupied (or rather locked from the outside for taxi/takeoff, but the first class was not. Inconsistent.), so I went for the first class lav since it was much closer, and the only one available. 

> The first class attendant stopped me and said that the seat belt sign was on and that I could only use the economy lavatories. I expected this, and I tried to explain that this was becoming serious, the aft lavs were locked, and I would only be a minute. Instead of being compassionate, she informed me, quite rudely, and with condescension, that I would need to return to my seat. Instead I went to the aft lavs and pleaded my case there. The economy attendants, being more understanding of the human condition, opened one of the lavs while making absolutely sure that I realized the seat belt light was still on. I was very briefly thankful. 

> While I was using said lavatory, I heard an overhead announcement from the first class attendant reminding everyone to use the bathroom in your ticketed cabin (even if all of those are locked, and you?re running the risk of soiling yourself). She ended the announcement with ?please be considerate of our policies?. 

> Having flown United hundreds of times over the past few years, and been seated in first class for dozens of those flights, I can tell you first hand that this lavatory policy is very rarely enforced. Come to the think of it, this was the first time I recall this particular policy being enforced. After witnessing such inconsistent enforcement over the years, I was shocked to be turned away in my hour of need. Especially after having just witnessed a first class passenger being allowed to use the lav with the seat belt light still on. 

> What are the FAA regulations on using lavatories during flight? When does a company policy supersede my right as a human being to have access to a toilet? Do flight attendants have any discretion on this policy (as I have obviously seen in the past)? 

> And perhaps most importantly, tell me why you deserve my business going forward? Why should I continue to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on United flights, instead of voting with my wallet and finding an airline that LUVs its customers?

> Instead of me being asked to respect company policies (by way of a public announcement made to the entire aircraft), maybe your staff should be asked to respect me.

> PS ? I?m writing this while still on the flight. A fellow passenger seated in row 7, behind the bulkhead (in the economy cabin) just successfully raided first class and was able to use the bathroom without a word from the first class attendant. Why was I singled out? Maybe it was because the other economy passenger who used the first class lavatory was an elderly woman with a limp. Further proof that the lavatory policy is loosely enforced. 

TL;DR - United Airlines doesn't care how bad you have to pee.

I'm still on the flight (United's inflight wifi is pretty good). I look forward to their reply.

1). All info up to date as of Week 7 2016 and as accurate as I can make it. All errors are mine. 

2). Teams coming off long homestands or homestand/bye weeks will have less flight data on FlightAware, or the flight number will have been reused for repositioning flights for other aircraft in the interim time between now and their last flight.  

3). Team flights to the UK are carried out by Virgin Atlantic, which uses Airbus A340-600 aircraft on direct flights from your team's airport to Heathrow. [Here's the Giants flight from last night](http://flightaware.com/live/flight/VIR9944/history/20161021/0041Z/KEWR/EGLL). Flight numbers vary for these flights but usually start with 994_. 

4). The Raiders use Airbus A330 aircraft from Hawaiian Airlines for all flights, Colts and Ravens use Boeing 777-200s for all flights. The rest of the teams use a mix of Boeing 767-300 & 400 models for long trips and Boeing 757-300 models for short hops, except for the Panthers and Cardinals who use Airbus A321's for their short hops.

To set the stage: I?m currently an FO at a regional airline. My path thus far has been part 61 PPL, part 141 IR, commercial ASEL/AMEL (university), part 61 CFI/CFII, and then flight instruction as a primary time build. I have no checkride failures, however I do have one failed stage check from the 141 program (non-certification check). My resume has some pretty good things on it, including a 3.9 GPA. 

Now to present day. I?m chugging along as a regional FO, making decent money, and enjoying the benefits. However, I feel that I am unhappy. I commute (by choice) but when I?m home I feel like a leech. Like I?ve put all this work in to make it to this job and now I?m here and I?m like...ok what?s next? But I realize with airlines that this is it. Keep plugging away. Now the job is fun, but not having a clear goal to better myself, I?m feeling lost. 

Now the good stuff: I?ve been considering military aviation since I was a kid. I always dreamed of it. After balking at the idea a few times in the past, I feel like now I?m drawn more than ever. I want to serve my country. I want to serve a greater purpose and have a place in this world. I have flight experience, I have a clean record, and I?m 24 years old and in decent shape (working on making that great shape). I feel like military life would suit me, given that I?m driven and don?t really have roots grown, a girl at the moment, or a happening social life. Furthermore, I want or possibly need a goal that I can work hard towards. 

All of that in mind, what would the best path be? OTS/OCS and active duty? AF reserve? Find an ANG unit? I?ve done some light research and I?m still digging, so I?d like some real input here. To keep my regional airline job is 50/50; I like the pay and benefits (family pass travel is a lovely gift to them) however personally, I could forego this if it meant some prime years of my life being the best that I can be. So, Reddit?thoughts? 

TL;DR: 24 y/o regional pilot wants to step it up and fly for the military (fighters preferred obv but also obv wouldn?t turn down any pilot slot)"

"2019-03-01 03:09:45"|"PT Airliner Jobs in Las Vegas?"|"So, got a quick question - I'm considering a part-time gig for some extra money on the side. I have a full-time job that I have full flexibility with my schedule and I can work from home/remote. I've been eyeballing airline companies for awhile. With all the flexibility of my new full-time job though, working in an airliner has always been on the bucket list. I used to be a Hotel Manager on the Las Vegas Strip and I had a few front desk agents moonlight for an airliner. Although their positions were usually low pay and they dealt with pretty upset customers from time to time, they put up with it because of the benefits.

So here is the snag that I keep running into. I've been checking job/career pages for the last 8 months (on a biweekly basis) on the following airlines: Delta, American, Southwest, JetBlue, Virgin, British Air, Hawaiian, United, Air Canada, Norwegian, and even the locally based Allegiant. I haven't seen ANY job postings for Gate Agent, Customer Service Agent or Baggage Handler (normally the only PT gigs I see offered at airliners) on any of their career/jobs sites. I see Spirit is looking for a Stockclerk right now, but that looks like a full-time position.

There are always hiring opportunities outside of Las Vegas (especially in Denver, Phoenix, and LA it looks like), but it seems like the door it always shut here. Is there a different avenue I should be trying or is the turnover rate for these positions in Las Vegas so ridiculously low that hiring is never a necessity? Maybe someone who works on the inside could add some insight? :-)"

"2019-09-04 07:39:41"|"Most annoying thing about the 787 (from a pax perspective)"|"So before people get angry at me for being negative about the Dreamliner, I bloody love that plane! I fly on it a lot (8 times so far this year) and think it?s a marvelous feat of engineering, I bore any one I?m sitting next to with all the epic statistics and love nothing more than watching that plane in the sky! 

My main issue with it is the windows, or more specifically airlines use of the windows! 

I remember my first flight on the 787 and was so excited with the window dimming magic ( the little buttons below the window that allow you to basically adjust the exposure of the window so it?s like wearing sunglasses, no more being blinded by that low lying sun). But recently I?ve noticed that airlines have been locking the windows in their darkest setting and leaving them like that for most of the flight!

I love flying and always want a window seat. I?ll happily sit separately from my friends, or be right at the back if it means I can get a window. But by controlling the windows and making it impossible to see outside for 10 hours it kind of ruins the flight for me. 

While I totally understand the use of being able to make the plane dark when on red eye routes when it?s best for everyone to be asleep but I was on a flight yesterday (a United flight from London to LA) which took of in the morning and landed in the afternoon and they had the plane in total darkness for about 8 hours of the flight. They served meals in the dark too! 

Has anyone else experience this? Does anyone have an explanation why airlines would do this? Other than keeping passengers docile and easier to manage for a tired crew. 

I would love to know as it really ruined my flight yesterday and made me not want to fly on a Dreamliner again if they continue to keep me in the dark!!"
"2016-01-30 18:47:53"|"Should airline alliances share check-in counters?"|"One thing occurred to me.  At an airport like Seattle where several Star Alliance members have single daily international flights to Tokyo (ANA), Seoul (Asiana), Taipei (Eva), Toronto (Air Canada), and Frankfurt (Lufthansa), would airport operations for all these carriers be cheaper/more efficient if they shared check-in counter space and used a single team contracted to serve all the different airlines from that airport picked by that alliance itself?

I'm sure the operation at check-in counters varies between airports and certainly between countries, but it seems inefficient to me that a foreign airline would have it's own counter space that only gets used for a couple hours every day.  This would also be true for staff that support it --> Wouldn't it be more efficient if say, Star Alliance partners that only had 1-2 flights per day out of an airport would share spaces with say, United, that runs continuous service for multiple domestic flights throughout the day?  Like, they should obviously have enough spaces dedicated to processing all the foreign carriers during the few hours they needed the counter space to check in travelers but to also have the space revert to the alliance's most-flown domestic airline when these flights departed for the day?  LED-configured signs behind the counter could be customized to the relevant departure at that time, and then switched to the other airline when its flight was coming up.

Would this actually change anything?  Is this being done to an extent already?  "

I can't find the specific FAA regulation stating that children over 2 must have their own seat, but it seems to be common policy for US airlines (e.g. [Delta's policy](https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/gb/en/policy-library/reservations-and-ticketing/infant---children.html)).

[FAR 91.107](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2014-title14-vol2-sec91-107.pdf) states:

Not sure if this is the right place to post this; I would have tried r/whatisthisthing/, but I figure you guys are more qualified to answer. I?ve been compiling a collection of aircraft in flight found in Google StreetView, and over the course of it gotten better at identifying aircraft (particularly airlines). However, I'm still just as clueless on identifying propeller planes and executive jets. As such, I was hoping some of you could help identify these aircraft. These are Google Streetview links, so you can move around and see different angles as needed. Long list, but these are all the aircraft I?ve never identified. 

I?m looking to identify the aircraft type (and aircraft ID if you can make/figure it out) and airline (if applicable).

If the aircraft is too blurry, or the angle is bad, or it's too common a shape, or simply not possible to identify based on the views available, please also let me know!

About a week ago I posted[ this video on Why Flying is So Expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Oe8T3AvydU) which was pretty popular and enough people asked how budget airlines work that I'm making a video on them. If anyone feels like it, I'd love it if they'd look over my script and let me know of any mistakes they see, any omissions, or any other suggestions. Obviously most people here will know more about the topic than me so your input would be quite useful. I will, of course, credit you at the end of the video if I use any of your advice. If you want anything other than your Reddit username in the credits (or no credit at all) let me know. 

Here's the script. Obviously certain sections won't make sense since they're meant to be presented with visuals. 

**	Two weeks ago, I posted a video on why flying is so expensive, and, people seemed to like it, however, people wanted to know, how are budget airlines so cheap? Well it?s another complex answer but an interesting one. For the purposes of simplicity, and to keep our European friends from feeling left out, we?ll focus on the European budget airlines. While there are low-cost carriers in North America, and South Africa, and India, and Asia and plenty of other places, budget airlines really first stuck in Europe and that?s where they?re most prominent today. The magnitude to which airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet reduce the cost in Europe is also much more significant. Budget airlines in the US might be 10 or 20% less expensive than their competitors while in Europe a fare on a budget airline might only cost half or a third of what you would pay to a normal airline on the same route. 
	So how do they work? Well, unsurprisingly, budget airlines essentially take every possible part of the flight and make it less expensive to operate. The most essential thing an airline needs is airplanes, and believe it or not, it is possible to spend less on those. In the months and years following 9/11, the growth of air travel stalled and most airlines were simply fighting to survive. Meanwhile, Ryanair placed a massive order of 737?s from Boeing at unbelievably low-prices. Placing large orders gives airlines a bulk discount, and budget airlines will often sell off their aircraft a few years into their service life for not much less than what they bought them for new. The 737?s that Ryanair operates are very fuel efficient which saves fuel which saves cost. The fuel efficiency of new aircraft offsets the higher purchase price, so EasyJet, JetBlue, Ryanair, and Spirit Airlines all have younger fleets than any major airline. Ryanair operates exclusively 737?s and this is advantageous to them. Having only one type of Aircraft means that pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and ground staff only need to be trained on one type of aircraft. Training individuals on different types of aircraft adds time and cost to their training and also makes them higher skilled workers that can merit higher pay. 
	Flight attendants on budget airlines are often in the beginning of their careers and receive little training. Of course they will get the required safety training but little to no hospitality training. They?ll also often serve multiple roles. While on the ground, some of the flight attendants might go to the gate and check tickets while others will clean the airplane. Through this, the airline eliminates three or four positions that they regularly would pay for.
	Let?s talk about Airports. You?re never going to see Ryanair fly to London Heathrow or Paris Charles de Gaulle because those airports are expensive. There?s only a set amounts of flights per day that can operate out of those airports so supply and demand dictates that landing fees are high and slots are regulated. Instead, Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted, or Luton in London or Beauvais in Paris, which, by the way, is a 80 minute bus ride away from Paris, isn?t even technically in the same region of Paris, and has a website that looks like this! In a lot of cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only airline flying out of an airport which gives them huge negotiating power. They can ask for lower prices and, if the airport doesn?t comply, just leave and the airport will cease to exist. If there isn?t a viable cheap airport available, budget airlines also can fly to regular airports at less busy times when landing fees and the chance of delay might be lower. 
	Now we?re gonna get into the nitty-gritty?the small details. The planes of budget airlines tend to operate all day non-stop. For example, in one day, this Ryanair plane went from Brussels to Copenhagen, Copenhagen to Brussels, Brussels to Prague, Prague to Brussels, Brussels to Nimes, Nimes to Brussels, Brussels to Trevioso, then finally Trevioso to Brussels. Budget airlines will schedule only 30-45 minutes between the landing of one-flight to the take-off of another which often leads to delays and leaves very little time to clean the aircraft. This does, however, mean that the airplane is always making money and passengers are not paying for the time it?s sitting around. Ever wonder why Southwest doesn?t have reserved seating? Well by having a first come first serve system for seats, people almost always show up to the gate early and line up in an orderly line. This way, less time is spent on the ground and more time flying. Another principle of budget airlines is the point-to-point model. Most traditional airlines have hubs where most or all of their flights go in and out of. British Airlines has London, Air France has Paris, KLM has Amsterdam. For most flights on these airlines, you?ll have to connect through their hubs. Budget airlines, try to have a lot of destinations from everywhere. The cheapest budget airlines don?t even allow for connections on their flights. Allowing connections adds cost because then you have to pay for ground crews to transfer bags, create a more complicated ticketing system, and pay to rebook a passenger if a delay in their first flight makes them miss their second. Speaking of ticketing, there?s often no way to get a ticket from a real person on budget airlines. Ryanair charges 45 pounds if you fail to check in online while EasyJet and some other carriers have almost all their check-in?s handled by machines. This, once again, cuts down on personnel costs. At the airport, these budget airlines won?t bother using jetways because they?re expensive. They?ll use steps and just have passengers walk across the tarmac or take a bus to the plane. 
	Budget airlines simply make more money, if done right. EasyJet (11.15%), Ryanair (24.10%), and Wizz Air (10.2%) all had higher profit margins than Lufthansa (4.03%), British Airways (7.09%), and Air France (2.15%). Many of the traditional airlines have unionized workers with salary agreements that cannot be changed while the budget airlines can hire anyone and train them in a few months. It?s also hard for these traditional airlines to grow. Any route they make has to be one with a lot of preexisting demand since much of their business comes from business travelers. Since budget airlines are targeted more towards tourists, any destination that Ryanair, for example, opens up in will become a popular destination just because it?s possible to go there for so cheap. Some traditional airlines in Europe are opening their own budget airlines to get in on this profit. Air France created Transavia and Lufthansa created Eurowings, both of which are taking massive losses. What they seem to forget is that the US went through this budget airline within an airline phase a couple decades ago. Delta created Song, which failed. US Airways created MetroJet, which failed. United created Shuttle, which failed, then they went into bankruptcy and decided they should try again and make Ted, which failed. None of these worked! Despite this, it seems like everyone in the world is starting their own budget airline. The reason Ryanair and EasyJet are able to succeed where others have failed is largely because they are so large. They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands of employees, they have negotiating power that allows them to overpower competitors. In the end, for us consumers, any competition is good competition. Even failing budget airlines will bring down the cost of traditional airlines and allow us to travel the world for less.**

---

I was flying ?Executive One Foxtrot,? which is the First Family. Three calls signs get special treatment, basically like being an emergency all the time, and those are ?Air Force One,? ?Air Force Two? (VP), and ?Executive One Foxtrot.? They do NOT hold. EVER! Controllers are supposed to know that, ESPECIALLY a DC area controller.

We were going home to Andrews AFB in August on one of those horrid days with thunderstorms cells all over the place. We were coming in from the west, which meant we had to dodge all the buildups across the whole place to get to ADW on the far eastern side.

**INSANELY BUSY FREQUENCY:** When I came up on Washington approach control?s frequency, it was a mad house. The controller was firing off holding instructions as fast as possible to American, United, Delta, Northwest, etc. Machine gun words.

This is a complicated radio call, too, not short and sweet. It has to include a radial, a distance, an altitude, a direction and a time to expect to get out of holding. The pilots then, technically, have to read it all back, which would further tie up the radio. But these were experienced pros, seasoned enough to reply with not much more than ?Roger.?

**BREAKING IN:** You have to carefully time your initial call on a day like this, so as not to step on a conversation. Very unprofessional. It?s kind of like jumping on a moving merry-go-round. You watch the pace and pick your place.

I listened to the rhythm of the calls and after about four sets of machine-gun holding instructions, I finally sensed a moment to key my mic, ?Washington Approach, Executive One Foxtrot at eight thousand.?

?Executive One Foxtrot, hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.? The time was about 45 minutes away. I don?t know what else he said because I didn?t need that crap, because I wasn't going to hold.

?Negative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed to Andrews on a 140 heading, deviating a couple of times to dodge buildups, then descend on the other side of the Potomac and turn north into Andrews.?

?Executive One Foxtrot. Negative, negative! We?ve got traffic stacked up all over the area. Hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.?

?Negative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed direct Andrews as I said before.?

This poor guy was about to pop a gasket.

?EXECUTIVE ONE FOXTROT. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. IMMEDIATELY ACKNOWLEDGE THE HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEED AS DIRECTED.?

I figured I needed to say my call sign loud and very slowly so the supervisor on the frequency would hear me, jump in, and save this guy from himself.

?Approach. This is ***EXECUTIVE! ____ ONE! ____ FOXTROT!*** We WILL proceed direct Andrews on this 140 heading, then we?ll descend and turn northbound after we cross the Potomac.?

**THAT DID THE TRICK:** The next call was a different voice. Very deep, very calm, and silky smooth. A movie casting director would have hired this guy for the quintessential controller voice.

?Executive One Foxtrot, roger, proceed as you stated. Do you need to deviate while you?re on the 140??

?Roger, we?ll have to deviate a bit left and right on that heading, but we can basically hold it until we?re south of Andrews, then turn north on our own. We?ll stay at eight thousand until we cross the Potomac. We won?t bother you folks with vectors or anything else.?

?Roger, Executive One Foxtrot, cleared as stated. My apologies for that, sir, he?s brand new to the DC area. That won?t happen again.?

He obviously did not want me to have the White House call him when I landed. It?s guaranteed that young controller never made that mistake again.

I always wondered what the airline pilots on the frequency thought about that exchange."

With the recent acquisition of Virgin America by Alaska Airlines in the United States, I came to wonder about some of the potential questions management and branding employees come to face in times of mergers and growth.

As it stands, Alaska seems to be taking over Virgin's route network as well as fleet (among others). The Virgin name will disappear, and Alaska will find itself in a very dominant position on the West coast. This is all fine and good, but I can't help but feel it being a bit silly for an airline situated throughout the West coast to call itself ""Alaska Airlines"". 

Geographic-based names and branding aren't uncommon of course, but they tend to be present in situations where a niche is being served and growth/competition aren't really present (think of Hawaiian, Air Seychelles, Air France, etc.). These brands tend to be able to get away with these names because of their niche, high-end, flag carrier status. More often than not, these airlines get subsidized by their respective governments anyway to allow for their operation.

Southwest is a definite exception here, but it can be argued that they really managed to distance themselves from the geographic name entirely by giving little focus to the Southwest U.S. at all. Many airlines like the startup low-cost long-haul ""Level"" from IAG chose for a name with no geographic ties to aid future growth, even though it will be based in Barcelona.

While Alaska Airlines has a strong brand in its area (which is more Seattle than it is Alaska anyway), I was wondering if it would be in order for a brand change? Picking up from where Virgin left off is a big task, and the trendy West doesn't really seem all too ready for their arrival. I'd figure a snazzier brand would be more in line with their low-cost aspirations. Not necessarily Virgin, but something a little similar.
I'm from the East coast, so thankfully I've still got my lovely JetBlue anyway.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Alaska Airlines should probably give itself a name/brand change to allow for a more smooth expansion along the West Coast. Agree/disagree?"

As this was the first turbofan produced, the term turbofan was not yet coined and it was actually referred to as a ?jet engine with variable augmentation by ducted fan? [1]. The Aspin 1 was produced as a prototype and was used on two different aircrafts, the first being the Fouga CM.88 Gemeaux Mk. IV [2] a test bed which allowed it to complete 1000 hours of testing successfully [1] and the second, a prototype helicopter Dorand DH-11 [3] which produced less than desirable results and was abandoned. A year later, the Aspin 2 had it?s first flight on the same test bed [2]. Turbomeca did not pursue the production of their Aspin engines despite the successful results during the tests. Furthermore, the Aspin engines had a much smaller TSFC than any other turbojet or turbofan at the time, however it may not have been a considerable factor for manufacturers as there were no environmental law and cost of gas was most likely negligible. Additionally, it seems maintenance costs were elevated and the engine was somewhat unreliable though nothing specific was mentioned. Despite abandoning the Aspin engines Turbomeca did not abandon the geared turbofan.
 

The second line of geared turbofans ever produced were once again manufactured by Turbomeca. The Aubisque engine is a low bypass geared turbofan that first ran in 1961. No iterations of this engine were produced; however, it had managed to garner more interest than its predecessors, the Aspin I and the Aspin II. Approximately 300 units of this engine were equipped onto the Saab 105, a military trainer aircraft [9]. These units stayed in service for 30 years and were replaced by the Willams FJ44 engines in the mid 90?s. The gearing mechanism did not employ the traditional planetary gear system one would expect but rather a series of spur gears [8]. Following the moderate success of the Aubisque, Turbomeca made one last attempt at the geared turbofan.
 

The Astafan was Turbomeca? last attempt at a geared turbofan. This engine had many iterations increasing its size and power however the none of them ever reached a production line. 
 

It is worth noting that all of the Turbomeca GTF engines were single shafts and ran at a constant RPM. Turbomeca? plan was to resist adding a secondary shaft and a free turbine all whilst giving the engine the flexibility to change thrust by adjusting the fan blade angles and the fuel flow. This required pilots to have to adapt to the different controls and the way the engine responds. Furthermore, variable fan blade angles most likely increased maintenance costs and complexity. These two factors were most likely the reason the engines were not well received despite offering a much lower TSFC and produced less noise.[12]


The next line of geared turbofans is the most successful line in the history of geared turbofans. Developed by Garrett, the TFE731 and its iterations have had over 13000 models produced [13]. Early productions were done by Garett, following a merger AlliedSignal continued the production and Honeywell took possession of the line at the end [14]. The engine first ran in 1970 and its continuous success can be attributed to it?s low TSFC, its reliability, its low noise pollution, and its superior thrust to earlier GTF?s [14]. Furthermore, Garett developed the engine using the standard two shaft design which had more success in the early days of the turbofans. Furthermore, the engine design is mostly based on the TSCP700 an auxiliary power unit which proved its reliability [14]. The fact that the engine was built on a proven APU allowed Garett to garner considerable amount of interest. The TFE731-60 is worth mentioning as it is the largest and the most powerful version of this engine it also had thrust inverters included. Additional variants were produced with afterburners to further increase the range of application of the engine however the TFE731 name was not kept instead it was called the F124-GA-XXX and the F125X.
 

Lycoming was the next to try its hand at the geared turbofan. The ALF502 first ran in 1971, however it did not get certified until 1980. Problems with the reduction gear, compression stalls at altitude and a TSFC 10% higher than promised delayed the certification and the production of the engine [16]. Even after its certification the engine had reliability problems, due to early gearbox and bearing failures the challenger 601 opted for GE?s CF34. The BAe146 that kept using the engine suffered problems after problems from fuel controls breaking to badly machined turbine blades. However, BAe never felt any safety risks considering the airplane was equipped with 4 engines and Lycoming? proactive repairs and customer service made them feel at ease [17]. Although the relationship between BAe and Lycoming was good, Airpac a regional airline in the united states was not nearly as happy with the engines. Airpac filed a 100-million-dollar law suit against BAe saying the poor reliability and the high maintenance costs drove them to bankruptcy. BAe ended up settling before the issue went to court and did not claim any responsibility, blaming the airliner for being poorly managed [18]. In the end, most ALF502?s was replaced with the ALF507, not much documentation is available on the ALF507 and it offers marginally better performances than the ALF502. It seems to be simply a more reliable version of the ALF502. The ALF family is the last of the geared turbofans developed until the recently announced PW1000G.

 

International Aero Engines tried their hand at a geared turbofan in 1987, however they never got past the design phase despite garnering a total of 104 commitments from aircraft manufacturers. In fact, the study was abandoned after only 4 months of research. IAE claimed it was a lack of funds rather than mechanical limitations that caused the project to be delayed indefinitely [20]. However, where IAE failed to produce Pratt & Whitney delivered.


P&W has so far successfully managed to scale the geared turbofan. They promise a considerable reduction in fuel burn and a 75% reduction in noise. They are also extremely confident in their gearbox boasting that no maintenance will be required except for a regular oil change [21]. The engine also boasts other new technologies that were overshadowed by the gearbox such as the fan made out of a trade secret alloy which allows the edge to be thinner than the carbon fiber counterpart providing a better aerodynamic flow. By improving the compressor and turbine blades design they?ve also managed to cut down on the number of stages required [22]. As of today, the only problem with the gearbox so far is in order to avoid thermal warping, a long start-up time is required [23]. Additionally, one of the PW1500G engines had a catastrophic failure during a ground test required to certify the C-series. P&W assures that the cause was not due to the gearbox, however they won?t say what did cause the engine to fail [24]. With two of their models certified, the PW1100G and the P1500G, P&W?s gamble with new technology seems to be paying off [25].

TL;DR: 7 distinct attempts to manufacture geared turbofans were done the first being in 1951. most never made it to production. The Aubisque and the ALF502/507 had relatively low success and the TFE731 was a major success. Pratts new engines will most likely be the next major success.

Would this not have simplified things and saved money the long run with maintaining them?   

So contrary to some critic's opinion's, I like United's A319/A320 configuration, including the slim Recaro seats - far better than their 737 and 757 product. 

pic:  http://s1182.photobucket.com/user/BeachBum1970/media/Airplanes/320slimline.png.html

I like the firm support for my back (I feel like I'm sitting with good posture), I get free movies and TV via UnitedWifi and internet browsing for purchase, and I even think the seat design with the grey and white is sleek and will probably age very well. This is a great combination and really all I could expect with a economy class seat. 

But then compare this to United's 737 fleet which I am really not excited to fly on - a lot of these planes have the old seats with DirectTV which I never want to use or pay for- these frequently lack power outlets/USB and are not noticeably more comfortable than a Recaro seat (even though they look more padded) - just more ugly! United is supposedly upgrading their 737 fleets now too with newer slim seats comparable to the Recaro on their A320's, but the design is different and really looks terrible! 

Pic: http://www.sanspotter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/united_airlines_san_sfo_trip_report_11.jpg

I've only flown on one flight with these new seats and they do not feel either more comfortable or like they will last very long. Will they be phasing out DirectTV with the introduction of these seats on the rest of the 737 fleets? The wifi was broken on that flight but I don't believe they have screens so will there be free movie browsing like on their A230's? Why didn't United get the Recaro seats for their entire narrowbody fleet? It seems like they're working great for them on their A320's and for Alaska on it's all-737 fleet.

I also saw the new first class product they're rolling out on their narrow-body fleets!

Is this a joke? The seats look straight out of a business class of a european carrier from back in the 80's. The tray table looks flimsy and the side pocket looks dangerous to put electronics in knowing what passengers let slip into the nooks and crannies of seats- these would seem notoriously difficult to clean. Also the area in between the seats as well as the arm rests looks to be at-best an inefficient use of space and tacky and cheap at worst. Why would United have gone with these designs?  They have so many examples of how to do first class right based on what's popular with travelers on other premium airlines.  This just seems like a downgrade to me. "

&#x200B;

(A little bit of backstory; feel free to skip to the questions if you'd like)

&#x200B;

Right now one of the career choices I would like to get involved in is commercial aviation. Since I was around ten years old, I have absolutely loved aviation to the point that by the time I entered high school, it was something I knew I would get involved with some day.

&#x200B;

My enthusiasm for aviation diminished a little bit when I was in high school as I took on a love for chemistry. This carried over to college, and I am currently a junior getting a bachelor's degree in chemistry. My love for aviation, however, is re surging and I would still love to be a commercial pilot someday. I wanted to ask a few questions about the profession so I can gather more information. 

&#x200B;

I apologize if some of these questions are vague or have cloudy answers.

&#x200B;

\-Questions-

&#x200B;

After completing flight school, what are the chances I get into a major airline right off the bat? I ask this since I live near a major hub of United Airlines, an airline I've flown basically my entire life. In a perfect world this would be my airline of choice. Reading their qualifications, I must acquire 1,000 hrs of fix-winged turbine time. So I assume this means that I cannot fly 777s right off the bat, but can I fly for a smaller airline somehow connected to a major airline? Or is there some way to obtain this required flying time with the airline itself? 

&#x200B;

What should I expect for salaries? I've heard rumors that co-pilots that start off right from flight school are dirt poor, yet senior captains for major airlines make quite a comfortable living. How true is this, and, depending who I work for, how does my salary change over time? 

&#x200B;

What are work hours like? A former neighbor of mine flies United 787s to Germany, but I thought I heard somewhere that he only flies a few times a month on these routes. I forget if he was a captain or FO if this makes any difference. Yet on the other end of the spectrum, I have heard horror stories of young FOs being overworked, flying upwards of 50-60 hours per week. I imagine it has to do with the number of hours you are limited to fly per month, but am not entirely sure.

&#x200B;

Lastly, is it possible (within reason, obviously) to have a preference on which aircraft to fly once hired? As an example, if I were to get hired by a major carrier that has hundreds of planes in their fleet, could I opt for flying a 737 or a A320 instead of flying a 767 or an A340? Or am I tossed on some plane and I don't have a say in which one?

&#x200B;

Would love some insight on this, as a career like this would really make me happy.

&#x200B;

Thanks!"

I am looking for a flight school in the United States. I would like to become an airline transport pilot, and I am currently looking at different options for the training.

I live in Finland, and here the cheapest way to get my EASA ATPL(A) is 59500? (roughly 73000 USD). I am looking for a way to get a better bang for my buck. EASA and FAA licenses are roughly the same content wise, and the conversion will not be a problem in the future. Do you guys have any recommendations on flight schools?

With the disappearance of Malaysian Flight 370 making headlines for the past few weeks, these questions will come up from time to time.

1. How much do GPS tracking units for aircraft normally cost?  (If such units exist.)

2. Based on the cost, who should pay for it-- the aircraft manufacturer on a per plane basis or the airline company?

3. How much more are you willing to pay for an airline ticket when an airline company passes the cost to the passenger?  $5 more per ticket?  $1?  $10?  $20?

4. Do you think that after this incident, the FAA and similar agencies will make GPS tracking units mandatory in the months or years to come?

I'm curious to read your opinions on this especially from pilots themselves and those that work in the airline and aircraft manufacturing industry.

My opinion: The FAA will likely make this a requirement on all US-based airlines or require it installed by the aircraft manufacturer, but time will tell.  Either way, the costs will be passed down to the passenger themselves and we'll end up paying for it.

Lastly, a real-time GPS tracking unit that communicates to satellites overhead is probably more realistic than the other suggested idea-- real-time streaming of flight data and voice recorders.  Why?  Bandwidth isn't cheap, and those who live in the US either with a cellular data plan or subscribed to a US-based ISP that places bandwidth limits knows this all too well.

Thank you."

For instance, lets say you have an airline with a brand new 787-8 and also a 767-300ER, and lets assume they have the same number of seats.

You have two routes, which are always filled to capacity: SFO to LAX, and SFO to NRT. Would you put the dreamliner on the shorter route, to maximize fuel economy when taking off, or does the majority of the 787's efficiency come while cruising, and so the longer route would be smarter while putting the lumbering 767 on the SFO-LAX?"

Do any modern jet fighters have the avionics to lock onto and ram a target? In admittedly extremely rare circumstances, could it enable the pilot to eject before impact? Even if the plane were unable to intercept another aircraft, it seems plausible that engaging ground targets might be useful occasionally. For example, if a plane on a deep strike mission loses fuel or oil, and would be unable to return home regardless, it could crash into a depot or something.

Perhaps more practically, if a plane is going down over unlandable terrain, the pilot could target a preferred site before ejecting.

I think this feature would be too complicated to design, test, train for, and operate, considering how rarely it would be used. Does anyone know of an implementation?"

&#x200B;

*Hopefully this is okay to post here (please notify me otherwise and I'll delete it).*

We're a team working under the grant of NSF (National Science Foundation of the United States) to develop a real-time in-flight data recording technology. Our aim is to extend the usability of black box and provide real-time transmission of flight data. This would mean the aviation company can analyze the current state of equipment to find abnormalities or equipment failure.

There have been cases where analyzing a black box (Flight Data Recorder) was impossible including a few cases where black box was not found. A real time transmission can extend the possibility of instantaneous incidence response while providing automated solutions on analytics.

We're aware that equipment such as Data Acquisition Units (DAUs) are able to transmit data once a plane is landing or taking off, but our focus is on real-time data acquisition. There are many countries that haven't mandated DAUs and private planes (including non-commercial) planes in US are not required to equip DAUs or other data acquisition units.

Our current aim is to extend the usage of black box data for non-commercial flights, privately owned aircraft and small airline companies (including fleets). Mainly to increase safety standard which includes algorithms alarming whenever an equipment performs badly. Since proper functioning of only selective equipment is displayed, a real-time data transmission would alarm mishappening quickly and responsibly.

We're currently looking for opinions from those involved directly with aircraft or indirectly with aircraft (study, enthusiasm, etc). Opinions including whether we really need a real-time flight data recorder and how was your experience with black box.

* Does the continued use of *just* black box makes sense?
* How was your experience with black box? Was it useful in analyzing when and why an equipment failed?
* Would you like the idea of having a flight safety department (or flight operations office) receiving instantaneous notification of a peripheral/equipment failure during the flight?

I'd love to have a conversation with you if you'd like to share your experience or opinion on this! Please reach out to me, we can be on a call for as less as 5 minutes or as long as an hour if you'd like to add something to it!

&#x200B;

Thanks again r/aviation!"

Now boasting the largest wide-body fleet in the world, with a combination of Airbus A380?s and Boeing 777?s totalling 234 planes.

Happened while climbing out, immediately started dumping all the way to the runway, but the plane didn't bother to try to get underweight by flying around for a while -- far as I could tell the gear bottomed out -- anyway, all worked out fine but I could never get a full answer for what happened (also, no free drinks either).  I've flown enough that I've seen a few things, but I've never seen flight attendants visibly worried but during this incident.  


Every now and again I think about it and wonder if it was a similar failure to UAL 232 -- I've written United a couple of times and gotten nothing, and I've checked NTSB, and since no one was hurt, there doesn't seem to be a report.    Not a big deal but it was certainly the sketchiest moment I ever had on an airline.  


Anyone have any suggestions for where else to look this up or figure out the whole story?"
"2019-08-30 06:09:12"|"Choosing a National Guard Unit that Aligns with Aviation/RTP Aspirations"|"Afternoon everyone,

Was hoping for some insight for those military members who have hopped on the booming Rotor Transition Programs that seem to be providing a world of opportunity at the moment. 

For some background I am currently searching for National Guard units where I might want to serve as a commissioned Aviation Officer.  Looking waaaay ahead, I have begun to research the possibility of applying for an RTP and flying for a regional airline for my civilian job once I hit the required 500 hours of rotary wing time. One thing I have been wondering about has been how the hiring process goes once you are trained up enough to apply to the major airlines. Mainly, if I should choose an NG unit now that aligns with the major hubs these airlines operate in. I?ve been told that due to seniority new pilots at major airlines have little to no say as to what hub they will be based out of. It would be a bummer to choose a unit such as 40th CAB in Fresno and then get assigned to Newark by United. 

I know I?m asking a question that is about 10 steps ahead of my current situation, but with IST?s being a headache and having an 8-year obligation to the Army, I figured I?d try and at least be somewhat strategic when making these choices ahead of time.

Any input is appreciated. Thanks."

Seeing as churning and award travel go hand-in-hand, this is also a word of warning for savy churners looking to transition into the next phase that is award travel. It?s not safe to assume the same success. The process of award travel is much more difficult.

My one year of traveling has come to a close. I haven?t traveled nearly as much as those who do it full-time, but I have spent more than two million miles on flights since 2017. This post is a reflection of some of the frustrations of the miles and points game that are often forgotten and omitted in posts on reddit and in the blogosphere. I went from being an avid fanatic of the hobby with barely any reservations to a huge critic of the many overlooked obstacles of award travel, especially the golden goose that is premium cabins that many, but not all of us, chase. After all, it was the first and business class redemptions rather than mileage currencies itself that got me and most of the people I know interested.

TL:DR: While churning and amassing a huge amount of points is relatively simple and straightforward (give or take the current rules in place and possible future restrictions), maximizing award travel can be quite the opposite, sometimes extremely time consuming and difficult to navigate.

I was introduced to the hobby in 2014 when, out of curiosity, I started looking up first class reviews. I stumbled across the blog, One Mile at a Time, and was blown away on how someone not much older than me was consistently traveling on first class tickets without travel benefits and little out-of-pocket expense. I finally was able to get my first ?true? churning card in 2015 and since then have opened up several accounts.

But being both a full-time student and employee, meant that I had almost no time to travel. And when I did have time off, it was at most a week, two if I was lucky. This meant long haul travel was often out of the picture due to time lost in transit which brings me to frustration point #1:

1. You need time to travel.

Now I know most of you already know this as it?s nothing new. However, many of my friends who started with me in this hobby in 2015 are still sitting on the same treasure chest of points with a few redemptions but nothing significant enough to make a sizeable dent in their balance. The biggest constraint for them and many others was finding leave, which tends to be the reason why most people don?t want to do round the world awards that otherwise are one of the best bargains for miles in the business. My solution this past year was to no longer stay a full-time student and employee, which being young and without a family was an easier choice to make than most. But say you are able to find the time to travel, then you soon come to realize the next frustration point.

2.	Finding availability isn?t as easy with miles as with cash.

And this point here, tends to be a real deal breaker, especially if your time off often correlates to holidays when everyone else is off such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year?s. Or if it?s off-peak, but on an airline that only releases one business seat to partners (ie: Korean Air). Or there?s availability, but only far enough in advance (ie: Qantas or Air New Zealand), but too early enough to guarantee you?ll be authorized leave. Or like Cathay or Lufthansa First, where it requires you to be flexible enough to plan a week or two before your trip. Sometimes the airline is just plain stingy and doesn?t like to release award seats (IE: American Airlines on domestic routes). Another catch is that airlines don?t apply the same supply and demand algorithms to award availability that they do to the usual cash seats. Only a handful of award seats are allocated and then are released and restricted at varying times as you get closer to departure. Maybe it?s an oversimplification, but it?s usually an all or nothing type of ordeal. It goes from saver awards, to unaffordable standard awards, to no availability. Sometimes even in the reverse order.  It?s usually not the gradual change in pricing that you typically see with cash tickets.  Don?t even get me started on trying to find premium availability for parties greater than two. Sometimes you even have to find availability using another airline?s website (British Airways search using American Airlines), or there?s phantom availability, availability not searchable online (Alaska for Cathay), married segment availability (Qatar), and the list goes on and on. But say, you find the availability but as you?re piecing everything together online, an error message pops up. You call the airline up, feed the flights, only to find out your trip is significantly more expensive than expected or that the routing isn?t valid. Here we have frustration point #3.

3.	Your routing isn?t always valid even if it?s logical.

Oh boy does this require TONS of time and research. Especially if you?re trying to go for the real niche redemptions that can save you a bunch of miles. You have so many airline programs accessible with transferable currencies, multiplied by the amount of partners for each airline, and then some. This of course assumes that the airlines actually publish these rules yet alone follows them. Take for example the ninth circle of award redemption hell that is SkyTeam, save for Korean Air. The two most popular members, being Air France/KLM and Delta. Neither publish award charts to add to their already poor search engines. So you get awards that price out contrary to logic (IE: JFK-CDG-ZRH might be cheaper than JFK-CDG). My personal pet peeve is the maximum permitted mileage restriction since many of my routings to Europe require back-tracking by necessity not by choice. American likes to segment cap awards which really punishes those in small airports or prevents routing through third regions with certain exceptions. This is where United really shines, even with the introduction of the Excursionist perk/restriction, MileagePlus is still the most generous among the big three in terms of routing rules. I spent almost every day this past year researching on this topic, and every time I think I come close to mastering a program, I find something new or a program change renders some of my past knowledge obsolete. Say you cross all your t?s and dot all your I?s on your upcoming Etihad first itinerary. You find the time to travel, find the availability, and verify the cost and route validity. You can call American only to find out that they can?t book it nor find the availability. Thus, frustration point #4 is often overlooked.

4.	Booking awards isn?t always straightforward

The example above is caused by US based American Airlines agents being unable to see Etihad first availability, whereas certain call centers like Australia and New Zealand are able to find and book your request. But sometimes it?s not even technical issues like that. YMMV even with the CS reps themselves, especially with one of the off the beaten track currencies like Turkish. One of the top posts on r/awardtravel outlines the process in booking a second first class JAL award seat and it?s a great example of frustration points #2 and #4. It?s great to see how some of the top posts in award travel help breakdown these processes in simple and easy to follow steps to make frustration point #4 much more straightforward. It doesn?t help that airlines love to tack on fees during the booking process: fees for booking close to departure, booking over the phone, booking on partners, etc. In the end, all these fees (sometimes avoidable, not always) make award travel not as free as it?s hyped up to be. I?m sure you can figure out our next frustration point, since people love to advertise award travel as free travel.

5.	Award travel isn?t free and neither are miles.

There are tons of clickbait titles and misleading propaganda on blogosphere and especially YouTube vlogs about how they scored a $XXXXX flight for $5 as the main point rather than the amount of miles used to book the flight. Miles are definitely not free and even if someone offered to cash out my entire point balance at a generous 2 cents per point, I?d still feel short changed. There?s so many rules in regards to taxes and fees yet sometimes the only way you find out is at the final step of the booking process. Taxes and fees vary depending on the currencies used and the airlines redeemed and navigating these can be a huge headache. So while I can redeem 230K United Airlines miles for a roundtrip between HND-FRA in ANA first class for ?only? $120, most people would agree that 93K AMEX points with a 30% transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic with $375 in surcharges is a much better redemption. So no, one doesn?t redeem first class ANA for just ?$120?. Props if you?ve read this far, as we?ve finally reached the final frustration point.

6.	Information on award travel is not as readily blogged as churning information or trip reports.

I think it?s a shame that there?s more focus on how to accrue points than on how to spend them. At first, this confused me, especially when the latter is much more difficult. What?s the point of churning if you can?t reap the rewards effectively? The cold truth is that blogs and referrals receive commissions on the amount of credit card sign ups, not the amount of award redemptions. In fact, many blogs also profit by offering award booking services so having everyone informed, would be a loss of another revenue stream. I only started browsing flyertalk once I needed information for award redemptions since information on churning is readily available, at times over saturated. For example, there are tons of posts advertising IHG credit cards and how Intercontinental Thalasso is a great redemption of IHG points! $1,000 vs 70K IHG points, 1+ cpp! But there are almost no posts anywhere regarding how to successfully book award nights, even on flyertalk where it becomes obvious it?s a closely guarded secret. There?s a huge discrepancy of information between r/churning and r/awardtravel, and while I think doctorofcredit is the best resource for churning, there?s clearly not as much information on the website for award travel.

In the end, award travel may not be as much of a glorified hobby compared to churning due to its difficulty, but it?s definitely just as important. In fact, I still hesitate pitching churning to certain people who can easily accrue points and succeed in the hobby, but don?t know anything about award travel. There?s little use in collecting a huge sum of points yet unable to redeem them, only for them to be devalued year after year.

I know it might seem like I'm just a cynic and anti-award travel, but I certainly still support this hobby just hopefully with a little more research and awareness from current and upcoming churners.

"2016-06-16 23:32:27"|"The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend"|"##The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend
June 16, 2016

I wanted to share a Las Vegas long weekend trip I just booked when the opportunity came up.  This is something most people can do with a bit of planning and time.  I structured the write-up around a single churner applying for 3 cards.  If you are churning for two, the same trip can be done more efficiently with 4 cards.  You do have to hold one of the cards for more than 1 year, and pay a $49 annual fee.

### The Cards involved

- Chase Sapphire Preferred/Chase British Airways (30K UR/Avios)
- AmEx Starwood Preferred (20K SPG Starpoints)
- Chase IHG (60k IHG AND 1 Annual Free Night after 1 year)

### Booking the Trip

The genesis of the trip was a SPG Moments offer: for 20K SPG points, you can get premium seats for two at a concert at Caesar?s Palace.  This was something we were looking to do over the summer, so having it pop-up was perfect.  It?s unclear what ?Premium? seats mean, but decent seats for the concert runs $2-300 per ticket.  So the 20K SPG points is redeeming for something between $4-600 in value.  Flyertalk search showed one report of the seats being in the 8th row, which would indeed be pretty good seats.

**UPDATE** SPG has gotten back to me with the seats.  They are in the orchestra section, and tickets for that section are going for $430 a piece.  So the 20K SPG points bought $860 worth of tickets. 

Las Vegas hotels discounts heavily on a regular basis, so folks often find the best value by just booking a discount rate.  When I started looking at hotels, I start with awardmapper.com.  None of the rates really looked appealing, but as I looked deeper, the Venetian and Palazzo are Intercontinentals, and award nights is priced at 60K.  This means that 2 nights there would be 60K IHG points for the first night, and an annual free night certificate (second night) if you hold the IHG card for a year and pay the $49 AF.  The better plan would be using two annual free night certificates, which I happen to have available.  Booking this was very easy, just login into your IHG account, and use the Book Free Night functionality.  When I looked, the rate per night is $300 at the Palazzo.  So signing up for the IHG card, paying the AF of $49 for the second year, will redeem for a value around $600.  Note, even if the hotel discounts 50%, you are still looking at a $300 redemption.  BTW, I found out afterwards that the hotels are all suites, with 720 sq ft in their standard rooms.  There is a $32 per night Resort fee that needs to be paid on award stays as well, but rumour is that there is a way to get out of it.  Reports also show that IHG Platinum and Spire Elites status means little to nothing at these hotels, so don?t expect an upgrade based on these statuses.  Royal Ambassador does get the expected recognition.

Last step, how to get to Las Vegas.  From Seattle to Las Vegas is just under 1,000 miles, which means if I redeemed Avios from a Chase BA card, or transfer points from UR to Avios, I would spend 30K points for two RTs.  To book, I would use AA.com, and search for awards costing 12.5K AA miles.  I can find award flights on Alaska Air at that redemption cost for both days, and write down the flight numbers.  I would then call BA directly, and booked these flights, as you cannot book Alaska awards on BA.com.  I did all these searches, and seats were available, but the timing of the return flight was atrocious, something to be aware of when looking at award flights.

Note that I describe how it can be done with a CSP or BA Avios card.  In my case, I chose to save my points.  The actual flights at more preferred times on this trip cost about $200 per person.  I also have an Alaska Air companion pass from the Alaska Air card, which makes the 2 RTs cost around $340.  As I value 30K of Avios/UR more than $340, I decided it was more valuable for me to save the points and pay for the flights.  This is purely a personal decision, and only you can decide whether paying for the flights, or using points is a better deal.

Now, what if Alaska air is not a useful redemption from where you live?  The Chase UR points can be transferred to United or Flying Blue, and you can redeem United or Delta award flights.  If your preferred airline is Southwest, then a Chase Southwest card with the 50K sign-up bonus, would very likely get two of you to Vegas with 1 card.  If you get the Companion Pass, it would further halve the cost.

### Takeaways

First of all, this is a pretty simple redemption.  Other than the BA award, you can do everything online.  Secondly, with just 3 cards, you can get a nice little weekend getaway without having to worry about MS or other complexities, and you will likely have some points leftover.  The only gotcha is that you need to get the IHG card, and hold it for a year to get the free annual night.  The ability to redeem at almost all IHG properties make the $49 AF an absolute bargain if you plan any IHG hotel stays over the course of a year.

Next, SPG Moments offer a different dimension on how to use points.  Other than just free nights or airline tickets, you can get some pretty interesting redemptions, such as boxed seats to sporting events, concerts tickets, or even mingling with players at a ball park.  This alone is a pretty good reason to keep on channeling un-bonused spend onto the AmEx SPG card.

Lastly, point valuation is very personal.  Some folks value getting as many free trips as possible, while some may see points as opening doors to premium travel that you wouldn?t really want to pay for in cash.  There is no right answer here.  Whatever works for you, is the best answer.

"2019-03-08 05:39:53"|"Chase Ultimate Rewards? Why is everything more expensive?"|"I've been a Chase Sapphire preferred holder since the card was first introduced.  I've tried several times to book trips on there while getting the value for my points and it's rather frustrating.    


Tonight I was looking at flights to Hawaii and a few things jumped out at me (also please note it's been this way for a dozen plus trips I've tried to book with them):  
1) Prices are about $50 higher than booking with the airline directly, that fluctuates a little by airline but generally its about $50/ticket each way, I prefer to book united and they were $52 more expensive.

2) On top of being more expensive I am unable to select my fare, so it's Economy Basic, which might be ok, but I prefer regular Economy which allows for carry-on.  Traveling with the wife and two kids one or two carry on bags will be necessary.  

3) Rental cars and hotels are the same way, the markup on rental cars is just ridiculous.  20-40% depending on the company.    


I could transfer points direct to United and wait for deals, but that's tough with a family and coordinating schedules in a manner that's best for school so that's not really practical for me.    


Now it is true that with my 25% points savings, booking through Chase is about 14% cheaper than booking through united, but it should be 25%.  I'm basically saving a negligible amount on travel.    


The final point I'll make, is booking through Expedia, or another similar site savings significantly more than booking with the credit card through UR or other method.    


Anything else I can do?  If the travel awards simply aren't worth it, it may be time to find a better card and just focus on Cashback.  "

We got a little of everything in this itinerary from a redemption standpoint: ANA RTW, a ridiculous redemption through the Chase portal, a three-night stay at everyone?s favorite RC Kyoto at the discounted rate, and some questionable single leg bookings. Please read about the process below before commenting on how dumb I was with some of these redemptions :)

**Step One: Planning the Redemptions and Utilizing Marriott?s Hotel + Air Redemption**

Planning how to make this trip possible seemed to change about every other week. As mentioned, this was our first time doing something like this, so I was learning as I was planning. Based on what points and miles we had collected (and what we planned to collect), I planned on the following: Marriott bookings for Tokyo and Kyoto, Chase UR for either Santorini or the Maldives and cash for the other, and a mixture of redemptions through United, Singapore, and/or Turkish of varying classes for the flights (I hadn?t really planned Osaka, Hiroshima, or Miyajima at this point since they were all one night stays). I used the Marriott Hotel + Air package available before the merger to book seven nights in Tokyo and transfer 120k miles to United. At some point (thanks to this subreddit!) I learned about ANA Round the World. We would save a ton of miles and fly biz class across the board at the same time! Unfortunately, there were less than nine months until the trip, and we had essentially nothing in MR. 

**Step Two: Booking the Main Hotel Stays**

While we worked on churning MR for the RTW tickets, I focused on booking our hotel stays. As mentioned, I used the Hotel + Air package for seven nights in Tokyo, and Kyoto was easy enough to figure out; with the category 8 redemption cost not taking effect until March 2019, three nights at the Ritz Carlton at 60k per night was a no brainer. 

My original plan was to stay in Santorini using Chase UR (as they do not really have any big international chains on the island) and use cash to pay for our nights in the Maldives at whatever resort we preferred. I never really considered Hilton points for the Conrad, as we didn?t have time to churn through those cards while prioritizing MR for the RTW tickets. After some research, we decided on Canaves Oia Suites for Santorini and either Huvafen Fushi or Anantara Kivanah for the Maldives. Back before the Chase portal change to be straight up Expedia, though, the hotel we wanted for Santorini wasn?t available, so this got swapped around. We had enough Chase points to cover four nights in the larger (and more expensive) overwater ocean bungalows at HF, and I read on Trip Advisor they have one of if not the best reefs for snorkeling in the Maldives, so I booked both of these using cash and a ton of Chase UR respectively. I know some of you may gawk at using so much UR for four nights, but staying in our number one choice is worth it for us. Churn and burn!
After all that, we did have some Hilton points sitting around that would cover a night in Osaka, but our Marriott points were depleted by the time I got around to Hiroshima and Miyajima. We wanted to try a night at a ryokan for Miyajima anyways, so I used our remaining Chase points for both of these.

**Step Three: Making ANA RTW Work**

Three Amex cards later, we finally had enough MR for two business class ANA RTW tickets. Unfortunately, it was December by the time all the bonuses had posted, and some previous availability had dried up while our dates were more or less set in stone (I really did not want to rework the entire itinerary at this point or bother with rebooking our hotels for different dates). By focusing on TAP Portugal, I was able to find some overseas flights to Europe in J for the first leg, and the last leg from Tokyo to the US wasn?t too hard to find; there were a handful of Asiana options, but I found a United flight with the new 1-2-1 Polaris layout and went with that. The difficult legs were to and from the Maldives. Getting from Male to Osaka wasn?t too difficult, just kinda wonky, but I couldn?t find anything for the inbound leg from Athens. Ultimately, I said screw it and used our AA miles (which aren?t hard to come by anyways) to get from ATH to DOH to MLE on Qatar. It cost 85k miles and little in surcharges but saved us 40k ANA miles and whatever the surcharges would?ve been, so it wasn?t a huge loss. Plus, the additional 45k miles may be worth it for Qatar; their J class looks awesome! I?m excited for our second leg, as it?s the QSuites product. 

You?ll notice from our itinerary, though, inbound and output flights for both Birmingham and Santorini were not included as well as MLE to BLR. As for BHM, there just wasn?t much availability that fit our schedule (as we had to depart Thursday night after work and return the Monday we left Tokyo; Denver was as far as we could get on the return trip). There were some options from Athens to Santorini and vice versa, but the flights were either really early or really late and included about $50 in surcharges per person per flight. Since flights to and from Santorini are cheap anyways, I decided using alternative means would provide more flexibility to enjoy our three night stay. MLE to BLR was supposed to be part of our RTW itinerary, as it was available when I pieced it together on the phone with the ANA agent, but when I called back a few days later to finalize the booking after the points had transferred, Air India flights were no longer available via ANA for some reason, so I covered it with United miles.

**Step Four: Filling in the Gaps**

After the RTW tickets were booked, here?s what was left: getting from BHM to EWR, a hotel stay in Newark, a hotel stay in Athens, getting from Athens to Santorini and back, and getting from Denver to BHM. We had just enough Hilton points to cover a stay near the airport in Newark, so that was taken care of right off the bat. My CSR travel credit posted sometime in February, so I used that for the stay at the hotel near Athens airport; there were cheaper options, but it was convenient and would ensure we could get to bed as quickly as possible off our flight and sleep in a bit if possible to help with jet lag. We also faced spending the night in Doha airport, and even though it wasn?t really necessary, we decided to use my remaining CSR credit and cash to cover a stay at the airport hotel to ensure we would be as rested as we could be on our way to the Maldives. Given it was our honeymoon and we still had money set aside for flights and hotels, we put aside the idea of maximizing value or saving a few hundred more dollars to prioritize convenience and rest. 

All that was left at this point were those remaining legs. This is where I messed up. I had that extra 120k United miles sitting around from the Hotel + Air package, and I was eager to put this all to bed. There was only one option from Denver to Birmingham via United miles anyways, so I forked over 22k a piece to get home. I had used all our Amex airline credits for AA gift cards to get us to NYC, but I did not factor in that the AA flights available did not fly into EWR and we?d be landing late at night. I didn?t want to deal with trying to get to Newark at 1 AM, so I changed plans and transferred Amex to Delta so we could land there and go straight to the hotel (I wanted us to hit the bed as early as possible to try to adjust for the upcoming time difference by waking up early). I went ahead and booked us seats in Comfort+ because why not, it wasn?t that many extra miles and I?m tall, and now I have a bunch of AA gift cards. 

Meanwhile, I kept checking on flights to and from Santorini. I prioritized Olympic, as we?d have two heavy pieces of luggage to check and the budget airlines would bleed us dry after that was factored in. I wanted early afternoon flights for both trips, but all flights around that time were $150 per person. There was an outbound flight available that could be booked via United miles for 8k per person and fees, though, so I went ahead and booked that. Nothing good was available for the inbound trip, so I checked every day for a month until prices dropped. I finally got one for $131 total that included checked luggage, which was great! But then I checked on the outbound flight, and it had also dropped in price to $45 per person, meaning I spent 16k miles and fees for what would?ve been $90. I checked the DEN to BHM flight as well, and it had also decreased in cost both for cash and points. So that whole ordeal was a waste of United miles, but at least it was all small scale and everything was booked.  

**Final Notes**

Congrats if you made it this far! I tried to be as succinct as possible, but there was a lot going on with this itinerary. Some of the redemptions weren't the best, and we could've gotten a lot more value for our points in the long haul if we didn't go absolutely bonkers with it, but I know that we are going to have the trip of a lifetime! In retrospect, given the limited time frame (all the churning happened in less than two years), there's not much I would change. I definitely would have prioritized the ANA RTW tickets first to improve what legs were available, and I'd want a do-over on booking those small legs at the end, but that's about it really! **A huge thanks to this sub for helping make this possible!** I have no idea what this trip would've been without all the advice and information I got from here.

EDIT: Forgot to include this in the original post, but we'll be staying 3 nights in Santorini, 4 nights in the Maldives, and 13 nights in Japan, with one night stops in Newark, Athens, and Doha between flights. We'll be gone for 25 days total including flights. 

EDIT 2: Adjusted redemption table for the DEN -> BHM leg to reflect the price decrease I mentioned; $750 was the price at the time of booking, it has since gone down."

* When I called VS to book an award ticket, first time I used regular contact number (+1 800 862 8621) and agent had no clue how to find open award tickets, she said there is no availability on the day I needed (United showed plenty of availability). HUCA, used Flying Club support number (+1 800 365 9500), agent found seats quickly. Interestingly all phone menu options are the same for both numbers, I don't think they lead to different teams. Probably HUCA helped.
* VS didn't charge me $$ for a date and a ticket class change I did two weeks after the original booking. I thought it's going to be $50 per person. Not sure if they forgot to, or they don't charge for partner tickets change. If latter, this is good to know, adds a lot of flexibility. Please share your experience.
* Ticket class change from Business to First didn't lead to increased surcharges. They were $266/pp (west coast - tokyo - west coast) and this amount didn't increase, just extra 10k miles per person, per segment.
* Citi, Chase, and AmEx points transfer is truly instant, it was done while I was on a call with agent - didn't have to put tickets on hold and call back, like many blogs/posts recommend.

Overall very pleasant experience."

Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say ?Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what??

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program?s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program?s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline?s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won?t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don?t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE?s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR?s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let?s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don?t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are ?Savers? awards, and ?Anytime? awards.  

?Savers? are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline?s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

?Anytime? are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I?m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay?s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it?s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It?s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United?s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let?s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don?t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won?t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don?t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can?t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don?t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven?t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let?s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline?s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like ?Use Miles?.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let?s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn?t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline?s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people?s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for ?Mixed Class?, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can?t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let?s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it?s own, but I?ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people?s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don?t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline?s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip?

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can?t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You?ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don?t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you?ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state ?On Request?.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to ?Ticketed?.  In the past, I?ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline?s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline?s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don?t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn?t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don?t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

##What is next?

There are tons of topics we did not cover in this Basics guide.  How to transfer Points, how to actually search for rewards, how to determine which FF to use, etc.  Let me know what topics you would like to see me cover in the future.

-----------------

My wife is currently in the middle of finishing a residency program which has severely limited our ability to travel. Her program ends in mid-July, with a full time position not starting until the beginning of September. We saw this as a golden opportunity for us to travel and for her to be able to spend a bunch of time with her family in Turkey.

The itinerary was dictated by a few things: my brother just started a job in Tokyo last week, so we're spending seven nights there to start the trip off. The nonstop ANA flight to NRT made this an obvious starting point, although I was pondering flying EVA IAH-TPE-TYO since I really wanted to fly EVA J. Unfortunately award availability, timing, and the fact that it would have been an extra 20k MR each make us stick with Tokyo first. I'm still hoping to do an IAH-TPE-TYO-IAH redemption using ANA miles sometime in 2019.

Next, we decided on Bangkok since I've wanted to visit Thailand for a while. We'll be spending a few days there before continuing onto Koh Samui. Originally we were thinking Phuket, but the fact that we had a couple Ritz certificates that hadn't been earmarked for anything led us to Koh Samui. We'll be spending six nights there, splitting our time between the Ritz Carlton and the Conrad.

The only Star Alliance flight that operates out of USM is the TG flight we're coming in on, so we booked 2x SilkAir economy tickets using 25,000 SQ miles and $47. I was happy to find availability since the cash prices were pretty nuts (over $300 per person for a one way).

In Singapore we'll be using some IHG certificates to book the Singapore InterContinental for a few nights, before boarding a (luckily 1-2-1 refitted) SQ 777-200 to fly to Istanbul.

I'll be spending about a week in Turkey with my wife's family before heading out. I am already taking a crazy amount of time off work, so pushing it too much longer would have been problematic. This is where I ran into the biggest issues with availabilty that Europe-NA availabilty was pretty limited. I could have flown IST-IAH nonstop in TK J, but I've now flown that product quite a number of times so I really wanted to try something new. 

Ideally I wanted to fly an airline whose business class I hadn't tried before and that wouldn't kill me with YQ. That excludes OS, LH and LX. SN had zero availability, as did UA (except for a 767 out of GVA). TP would have blown my mileage count up diverting to LIS. 

So that basically left SK and AC. I originally found some space IST-BRU-YUL-IAH in all business class. I was very excited since I hoped to build in a day or two to see a friend who lives in Belgium. Unfortunately the YUL-IAH space was only bookable by Aeroplan and ANA couldn't see it. Not having any good options back from YUL and with the same problem for all non-mainline AC flights to IAH (basically all of them) I settled on SK. There was some space CPH-IAD on an A340, which is a plane that has always fascinated me. 

Unfortunately I then ran into some problems with TK space that I've encountered with some of their shorthaul routes before: they tend to just pop in and out of existence in the Star Alliance award reservation system. Even though there are multiple IST-CPH flights per day from both IST and SAW, there were exactly zero Y or J award seats for the entire month showing up in the system. So I ended up needing to book a connecting flight in the one city with availability that would not put me over 22k miles: Dubrovnik. From there I'll be flying SK to Copenhagen. My ticket is I (J), but all of SK's narrowbody fleet just has Y seats so I have no idea what (if any) differentiation in service I'll get there. Finally, there is also (of course) zero ""I"" space on mainline domestic UA flights, so I'll be flying that leg economy.

My wife's flight back was easier: she wanted no fuss, so we put her on the IST-IAH nonstop in TK J.

Booking the flights was a little nerve-wracking because of the limited availability IAH-NRT. When I started looking there were two J seats the day before our ideal departure date and two available on our date. The day I finally pulled the trigger the two seats the day before disappeared, and it turns out that there was a party of three waitlisted for the ANA flight we ended up booking. I ended up calling into the ANA award desk three times. The Japanese agents were some of the most professional and efficient that I've dealt with. The process was really pleasant: I just fed them the date, route, and flight numbers I'd found and they searched for availability and calculated the mileage. They had no issues booking two concurrent itineraries with different legs, although they ended up needing to be on two PNRs. The final call took 45 minutes from start to finish, with about 35 minutes of that being taken up with the agent looking for availability then reserving the space, and then the ticketing office calculating the taxes and fees.

The total cost for the booking was 125,000 ANA miles and $223.78 for me and 125,000 ANA miles and $319.23 for my wife. 2x $25 phone booking fees were also added onto each of our tickets, Points were transferred to my ANA account from my wife's MR account. The transfer time was less than 48 hours, which I was pleasantly surprised by. I also ran into a little snafu that ended up saving me some MR: given that ANA transfer times aren't super predictable, that our mileage was very close to 22,000, and that we would potentially need to book a longer route if seats dried up, I'd originally planned to transfer 290k MR over (since that would cover us up to the next award tier). Since my wife didn't have enough MR in her account, I initiated a transfer of 260k from hers and 30k from mine. Of course I found out a couple days later that ANA only will accept a single transfer per day to a single account; the second transfer will automatically be rejected. This ended up working out for us, since I ended up with 10k stranded at ANA instead of 40k. In the end, however, I don't think I would have had a problem using 40k ANA miles within three years.

After booking the flights I locked down a few of the hotels. A quick call to Marriott got us the Prince Sakura Tower for seven nights, just needed to use 90,000 Marriott points to upgrade the Category 1-5 certificate that I wasn't even sure I was going to be able to use. Next we called Marriott to book the Ritz for two nights with the certificate. The agent was a little confused since she had only booked with Marriott free night certs before, but it still ended up being a painless and quick process. I used a single IHG free night cert to book the Singapore InterContinental- in the next couple months we should be getting two more in that I'll book with once they post. Hoping availability isn't a problem. We still haven't figured out Bangkok, but there are just so many great cash options that I have a feeling we won't be doing an award booking there. Turkey is covered by family (plus the Hilton Garden Inn the night before my flight to DBV: 5,000 HHonors points instead of $50 is something I can get behind). And I'll be doing an AirBNB in Copenhagen.

That just left four more nights on Koh Samui. I was originally thinking about doing a cash booking, but I was underwhelmed with a lot of what I was finding. This is a once-in-a-lifetime trip for us and I wanted to pull out all of the stops, so I decided to go for the Conrad on the southwest corner of the island. Signed my wife up for the Hilton Aspire (the day before they started publishing referral links, of course) and I signed up for the Ascend Business. Those two cards plus my wife's exisiting small HHonors stash would give us enough points to book three nights with a fourth night covered by the weekend night cert. Met the spend on the Aspire within 24 hours of getting it (thanks instant card number!), so those points should be coming fast. But the weekend cert will probably take a while to show up in her account. I""m a little nervous that the low level room space will disappear before we can get that cert, so I made a reservation for a third night at the Ritz just in case we can only do the three points nights at the Conrad.

So that's basically where the trip is at the moment. An itinerary like this is something I've been itching to put together for a while, so getting most of it worked out feels pretty good!

-----------------

**2/22/2018 Edit**: Getting rid of a day in Bangkok in order to do an all-points booking at the Conrad, letting us get a fifth night free. Got another Ascend card to facilitate that. Also added a ryokan in Hakone for an overnight in the middle of our Tokyo stay (thanks /u/captainhector1 for that suggestion!).

-----------------

**3/15/2018 Edit**: Booked our Bangkok hotel and extended our rental car by a day for Koh Samui.

-----------------

**5/9/2018 Edit**: Booked an AirBNB for my overnight in Copenhagen, and switched my Bangkok hotel to take advantage of the CITI50 $50 off two nights at any hotel. Basically trading 8,200 TYP for 6,000 Starpoints.

-----------------

**6/14/2018 Edit**: Changed our Hakone hotel booking to a nicer place with dinner included. Hoping my ExpertFlyer alerts pop up sometime soon that there's ""I"" space for the IAD-IAH leg (doubtful, but one can dream).

-----------------

**6/26/2018 Edit**: A bunch of changes! Decided to roll the dice with the merger that the Ritz certificates would be category-unbounded and canceled the Ritz. The hotel was also not exactly what we wanted for our first two nights: we ended up booking a cheaper (and much more downscale touristy) hotel so that we would be right on a really busy beach. Plus just breakfast for two for two days at the Ritz would have cost more than 2/3 as much as the hotel we ended up booking.

We also decided to pay for a Hilton Premium Club Asia membership, which gives us a few free meal certificates we can use at Zest at the CKS as well as a 50% off discount that applies to all food there including Jahn. The math is a little iffy and we will probably break even, but I mainly got it to reduce the stress that my cheap-ass endures when ordering obviously overpriced food at a resort. 

A side effect of the HPC membership are some accommodation certificates. I was able to use two to book the Conrad Bangkok- one complementary night and one night at a promo rate. I've already emailed the hotel and they will be upgrading us and hopefully doing something nice for our anniversary. There is some renovation going on at the hotel that closed most of the restaurants there but I don't really care since we aren't planning on eating at the hotel.

So net change in cost is +$379 and +21,000 UR, but I'm getting a (significantly) nicer hotel in Bangkok, a more appropriate hotel in Koh Samui with a nicer beach, significant food savings (on overpriced resort food), and two Ritz certs that I'll hopefully be able to use for a trip next year.

Overall, pretty happy and I'm going to stop messing with my itinerary now (unless UA J space opens!).

-----------------

**7/9/2018 Edit**: I couldn't leave well enough alone and decided to swap a 4 am wakeup in Istanbul at a HGI for a night in Dubrovnik at an AirBNB. Cost was $6 in tax differences to change my flight to the day before, plus $74 for the AirBNB."
"2018-05-15 22:46:17"|"Traveling to Japan? Read this"|"We've seen a LOT of travel to Japan posts recently. I would like to revive this post from /u/hidingfrommywife1 on booking ANA F through VS: https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6e82ub/detailed_walkthrough_on_how_to_fly_to_tokyo_in/

tldr: search availability on United.com, identify ""saver"" award flights operated by ANA, call VS at 800.365.9500, feed them flight times + flight class, put flight on hold for 24h (free), transfer points (instant), call back and confirm ticket.

*When searching on United.com, I recommend searching for ""nonstop only"", award flights (obviously), and picking business or first for class of service. Then, once you're on the actual results page, you can use the 30-day calendar in the middle of the screen. With those filters in place, anything on the calendar with 110k will be saver availability (for F, that is)

F: 110k ~~SEA~~, ~~SJC~~, SFO, LAX - 120k JFK, ORD, IAH, IAD

J: 90k - 95k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Y: 60k - 65k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Booking through ANA:

[Low/Regular/High Seasons (also where I obtained these mileage values)](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/int/usage.html)

Y: 40,000	50,000	55,000	

J: 75,000	85,000	90,000

F: 150,000	150,000	165,000



Other common questions:

* You can transfer to VS from all major currencies
* You can only transfer MR to ANA
* NRT and HND are co-terminals. You can fly into one and out the other
* You can redeem as an open jaw. Any US Airport  serviced by ANA -> either TYO airport. Either TYO airport -> any US airport serviced by ANA
* Is F worth it? Yeah its pretty cool. But J would probably adequately satisfy you. The reason F is more popular is because J availability is somewhat scarce. 110/120k on VS versus ~85k biz (either booking method) isn't that much worse though. ANA F for 150k is probably not worth it.
* F is cool but not that great for flying with a companion (hard to talk to them)
* Other choices: you can also get to TYO on United (lots of miles) [or using AA miles on JAL](https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/redeem/award-travel/oneworld-and-other-airline-partner-award-chart.jsp)  (find availability on ba.com, call aa to book), and through Delta."
"2016-03-10 16:03:42"|"Overview of Getting to Europe Using Chase URs"|"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/), I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:


***Chase URs***

Chase offers only one personal card that allows for the transfer of Ultimate Rewards points to airline partners ? the Sapphire Preferred card. Chase is pretty strict with their approvals for this card, so if you have picked up more than 5 credit cards in the past 24 months, chances are good you will be denied if you apply for this card, so plan accordingly/carefully.

Your URs will transfer to 6 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your URs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Korean Air**

Korean Air is a SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can redeem your SkyPass miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Korean Air is largely considered to be one of the best bang for your buck redemptions to Europe in general and is the best option among UR transfer partners.

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 50k miles for coach, 80k miles for business class and 100k miles for first class ? which is the best option for premium cabin redemptions to Europe. Korean Air does allow for one-way award tickets, but as u/wiivile pointed out, the cost is the same for a one-way award as it is for a roundtrip. You are also allowed one stopover on a one-way award ticket and two stopovers on a roundtrip award ticket, which is truly incredible considering you are already getting one of the best redemption rates to Europe to begin with.

While Korean Air Skypass miles offer one of the best values, it can be difficult to work with Korean Air. If you are planning to use your miles to book an award ticket for another person, that other person has to be a family member (mother, father, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, wife, husband or child). You will also need to call in to Korean Air to book your award and the process is somewhat arduous. I would recommend that you call in to make sure space is available and then place a hold on your award ticket(s) before transferring your URs to your Skypass account.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your URs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe ? especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore?s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**United**

United is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. As with Singapore Airlines, that means you are going to have a ton of options!

United uses a two-tier award system for their awards. Economy tickets are the same cost regardless of whether you are on a United flight or a partner flight. A roundtrip saver coach award ticket will cost you 60k miles.

Business and first class award tickets on the other hand will differ in price depending on whether you are flying on a United operated flight or a partner operated flight. For United operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 115k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 160k miles. Alternatively, for partner operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 140k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 220k miles.

As you can see, the much better value when redeeming for premium cabins is with United operated flights ? though the actual product is going to be far less enticing than what some of United?s partners such as Swiss Air offer. Since Singapore Airlines would have access to much of the same award inventory as United, you are better off transferring your URs to them instead and then booking the exact same flights for 5-60k miles less.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the worst UR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Southwest**

Unfortunately Southwest does not currently fly to Europe, nor do they have any partners that fly to Europe. If you have a Chase co-branded Southwest credit card, there is a way around this to use your RapidRewards points for international travel, but the value is usually exceedingly poor and I will not get into how to do so here as it will rarely work out in your favor.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your URs!"
"2019-06-25 01:26:29"|"List: When Airlines Open Award Availability"|"Here is a list of some airlines and a VERY incomplete list of when they open up award availability. Some of the dates, I have verified. Others I have not and I know some are wrong. I live 16-19 time zones away from most of you, so many dates are +- a day. Due to my time zone ?issues,? my strategy is to look a week or two before I think my days are bookable and use that to calibrate the exact day I can book.

Sometimes time zones make a difference if you want to snag an award that is released on a schedule. As a general rule, if the booking airline is the limiting one, it will be released according to their time zone. If the operating carrier is the limiting one, there is a higher chance it will be released based off of the operating carriers time zone.  As a general rule, an airline cannot book partner award space before they open up bookings for their own space.  Qantas is one exception to this rule.

Please help complete this list. It is old and out of date. Feel free to correct dates, add airlines, or add dates.

**Edit: How to use this list.** If you are booking a partner award look at the line for the airline you are looking to fly **and** the airline that operates the mileage program you are booking through. The lower of the two numbers is when you can book the seat. Example: Booking JAL via AA. JAL seats become available at 360 days and AA allows booking 331 days out.  You can book these seat 331 days out. Remember that the time zone of the more restricted airline/program is what matters.

If you are trying to book a seat with a program that does not allow you to book at schedule opening, like the JAL example.  You can check JAL's website at 331+ to get an idea of what seats will be available when AA gets access to JAL's space.

The exact time of day does matter for some bookings.  Please leave any time DP you have in the comments.

Doing as much research as I can and finding out there is a lot to learn. I have been wanting to do this for so long, but now it may become a reality. Plan is for this summer to go to Europe for the first time in our lives (wife and I). Planning for 3 weeks sometime in June or July. I have a cousin in Germany (can't remember if it's Hamburg or Frankfurt) and we also plan to get to Milan, Paris, and possibly Amsterdam if time permits. Germany will be our last stop and where we fly out of to go home. Home airport is IAH, but we can get to anywhere in the US to make whatever flight necessary. If we need to go to JFK or MIA we will probably spend a day or 2 there before the flight. ~~First class~~ into Europe and economy/biz back home.

*Edit: J into Europe and J or economy to get home


1. Can you help me choose an order to hit the cities in Europe? Want to use train once

2. What first class flight/airline would you choose? This will be our first time and probably only time so I want to make the most of it

3. Is 3 weeks enough time to hit 3/4 countries?

4. I already have a place to stay in Germany due to my cousin, but should I make a Marriott nights/flights redemption and use those points towards my flight and also stay a week in Paris or Milan? I want to maximize our time there to see as much as possible, but also have down time

5. Would you try to slip Amsterdam into this trip? Open to other options too

So those who wants to experience United Polaris on a long-haul international flight, this is a pretty good chance. This flight isn't even on the United website yet, and is only bookable through phone. When I called, the agent found tons of saver availability (I asked him to look at 4 different days and he found 2+ seats on all of them)

"2019-04-12 14:28:49"|"Honeymoon in Bali advice :)"|"Hi y'all,

Accumulating all these points has certainly been fun, but now it's becoming crunch time for us to book our honeymoon for this upcoming fall! We're looking at spending around 3 weeks in Bali/Indonesia.  Hoping to fly biz.

From what I've researched, I think our best bet is going to be booking with UA.  I've found a decent amount of ""mixed cabin"" award flights for 90k pp one way, which we don't mind flying economy for the short domestic flights.  The biz flights are with EVA.  It'd be awesome to take advantage of a stopover, but I couldn't seem to find any availability to make that happen.

I'm looking at CLE > ORD > ICN > TPE > DPS.

I've also looked at Singapore Airlines' availability, to transfer to KrisFlyer points, but it looks like its mostly waitlist for biz class.  Plus we'd have to book flights to get to one of their origin airports like SFO or LAX.

Here's our stash situation:

360k UR

60k United

15k AAdvantage (lol)

and we also have the SW CP with only about 5k SW points left in that bank.  Not sure if it'll help much in this situation, unless we can book a cheap flight to get to a better starting point to fly international.

We're going to be flying out of the CLE area, so CLE or PIT would work.  Our dates are flexible - we're getting married Sep 21, so anytime within the next week-ish after that would be ideal.

Any insight would be much appreciated!  Is it too ""easy"" just book through UA?  Seems too simple, but I can't find a better redemption given we're pretty married to UR, and we're only about 5 months out :)"
"2019-05-02 04:15:06"|"ANA RTW Booked"|"**Flights:**

Booked a RTW trip through ANA for December for P2 and myself! We wanted to fly business class, so we spent 2 weeks deciding where to go, when to go, and sometimes changing destinations to fit availability and satisfy ANA mileage restrictions. We searched availability strictly through United and it satisfied most of our needs. In the end we landed on:

|From|To|Days Spent (At destination)|Airline|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Chicago (ORD)|Tokyo (NRT)|5|ANA|
|Osaka(KIX)|Beijing (PEK)|Connection|Air China|
|Beijing (PEK)|Phuket (HKT)|5|Air China|

|Frankfurt (FRA)|Amsterdam (AMS)|3|Lufthansa|
|Amsterdam (AMS)|Toronto (YYZ)|1 day (Connection)|Air Canada|
|Toronto (YYZ)|Chicago (ORD)||Air Canada|

&#x200B;

This adds up to about 25 days of travel, \~21,750 miles (right under the 22,000 cut off), and 6-7 destinations. We were hoping to fly the new Polaris, but couldn?t find availability on our dates booking <8 months out. Also sad we couldn't find SQ availability. We still have to plan a lot of the trip, but some things we know for sure are:

* We?re going to take the train (or maybe a flight) straight to Kyoto/Osaka as we liked it more than Tokyo last winter.
* Budapest has a brand new Hyatt opening up that?s about 300 Euro/night, but 8k only points/night, so excited to stay there!

**Booking:**

We each transferred 125k MR to our ANA accounts, the transfer took less than 40 hours for both of us. Then I called ANA and told the agent the flights we found, and asked her to search for 2. In one instance she found a better flight than I did, that I can?t/couldn?t see on United (Osaka to Phuket). She also confirmed we can flights VIE>BUD even though that?s technically backtracking. I was able to book everything for both us from 2 separate ANA accounts since I had both numbers.

**Cost:**

125k MR transferred to ANA by each of to our individual ANA accounts, and $1176 for fuel surcharges. A bit on the higher end, but I?ll live with it. Although I must admit, I'm a bit jealous of [JonLuca's redemption from a few days ago for half the fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bgy1jm/booked_rtw_on_short_notice/)!

&#x200B;

TLDR: 25 days of travel on ANA RTW business across 7 destinations for 125k miles and $1176 per person."

&#x200B;

So I have been planning a trip to HKG for a minute but since there have been months of protests with no end in sight I am thinking I should re-plan my trip.

So pretty much here was my plan - anyone out there have good ideas for somewhere else to go?

\- I have enough United Miles to go Polaris - that was a big part of the trip, so wherever I end up going I would like the bulk of the flight hours to be on Polaris.

\- The food in Hong Kong seems amazing and I was looking forward to gaining several pounds of Michelin Starred Deliciousness.

\- Scenery is epic there.

\- Was planning on total trip time being 10-14 days sometime in Jan/Feb.

\- Was planning on a jaunt over to Thailand or Vietnam.

\- Was also looking to have a few bespoke suits made (silly I know, but it is my trip after all).

&#x200B;

Any thoughts or input is greatly appreciated!

1) I am booked on Eva's J class from seatac to Taipei (thank you so much to u/hidingfrommywife1, u/ASUbuckDevil and u/s1m0nr  for their great advice on airline classes and other spots to goto!)

2) Am booked for 15 days, at this point I will spend a few days on either side in Taipei, then go to Hong Kong for 3 days, a day in Macau (thanks u/twotwo4 !) and then head to Vietnam/Thailand for a few days each (looking into Hoi An - thanks to u/grovemau5)

3) Will return on a 777-300ER Polaris United jet, so I will get to compare.

"2019-07-14 20:26:42"|"[Pics] Travel report, San Fran to Beijing with layover in Seoul"|"I saw that with the layover it's 70K points on United (one way), so I could buy a business class ticket for both me and my girlfriend.

1. They were not available until that same month, so actually I didn't get the exact day in Seoul I wanted (I got Thursday, even though the previous month they had Friday in Seoul). I also had to pay $89 per ticket for booking so close to the date. But the business class savers are only available when the business class seats don't sell out, so it's always close to the date...
2. I used Chase UR points and transferred to to United. I had to call in because it was the first time I was doing this, but otherwise not too bad.

Now for the amenities:

They gave us access to the business class lounge, which had fancy drinks. Some food too, but nothing special. It's usual lounge food. You get better food in Asian lounges (but usually worse drinks).

The flight itself had decent food, and I kept asking for more champagne. But being 6'4"", I was disappointed with the leg room. I couldn't actually bend my legs either, since you stuff them into a hole, so bending them wouldn't fit either. I had to bend and sleep on the side. For business class, this was a let down. Of course, if you're short you have no such issue, it's plenty leg room for people under 6 feet.

They had good screens for entertainment and headphones, but I wish they had better selection. Going to Korea I expected local entertainment. My girlfriend liked that they had a mirror.

Pics here: 
https://imgur.com/a/27VeHO6

I had a long layover in Seoul, which meant we could spend a whole night there. I wish airlines would actually give longer layovers, but that's another subject entirely...

Of course ""business"" class from Seoul wasn't anything special, since it was on a smaller local plane.

Tl;dr it was good, but I'll have to try something else due to the height issue. Maybe it's worth it for you if you fit."

**What is NEXUS?**

NEXUS is a bi-national, Canada-United States program for pre-approved, low-risk travellers entering Canada or the United States (U.S.) at designated air, land and marine ports of entry. The program enables its members to enter either country more quickly and easily by using automated self-serve kiosks in the air mode of travel, dedicated lanes in the land mode of travel, and by calling Telephone Reporting Centres (TRCs) prior to arrival in the marine mode of travel.

**What are the benefits of using NEXUS?**

NEXUS members avoid long line-ups and save time using automated self-serve Nexus kiosks at nine Canadian international airports to enter Canada and Global Entry kiosks when entering the U.S. (NEXUS Air). As an added benefit, when travelling on domestic, U.S.-bound, and select international flights, NEXUS members can be expedited through Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) airport security screening lanes located at 16 Canadian airports. Members must present their valid NEXUS card to access the Trusted Traveller CATSA Security Line. NEXUS members who are U.S. citizens, U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents, or Canadian citizens will also receive the benefits of TSA Pre-Check. They can do so by entering their membership number (PASSID) in the ?Known Traveler Number? field when booking reservations, or into their frequent flyer profile with the airline. Members also enjoy a quick and simplified entry process using dedicated lanes at 21 designated land border crossings (NEXUS Land). When arriving by boat, members receive expedited processing at designated marine locations by calling a marine telephone reporting centre. (NEXUS Marine)

NEXUS allows Canadian and U.S. border officers to focus their efforts on unknown and potentially higher-risk travellers and their goods. **Apply for a NEXUS card today at** [Trusted Traveler Programs ](https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/)or visit the Trusted Traveler Programs section of the CBP website at [www.CBP.gov ](http://www.cbp.gov/)or the NEXUS section of the CBSA website at [www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/)."

I'm currently in Chicago, so United Airlines is the go-to. I travel within US on United often for work and also fly to Asia  ~1-2x every year on my own personal expense via All Nippon Airways (ANA). Every time I fly on United, I accumulate it with ANA and am currently at Silver status with Star Alliance.

I'm wondering if it will be better if I just switch to MileagePlus, and just accumulate my miles here, then use them towards ANA flights. Would that be a better strategy? Does that mean I have to start at the bottom again with my Star Alliance status, or can I continue with my current status? Any advice on this is greatly appreciated!

Since we have been getting the question almost daily, I decided to put together a 101 type of post on one of the processes for finding the best/least expensive redemption. You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your URs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your TYPs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

Airline | Alliance | Total Mileage Balance
:--------:|:--------:|:---------: 
Delta | SkyTeam | 109,000 Miles
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 110,000 Miles
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 65,000 Miles
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
American Airlines	 | OneWorld | 54,000 Miles
British Airways | OneWorld | 109,000 Miles
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 44,000 Miles
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 110,000 Miles
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qantas | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 175,000 Miles
United Airlines | Star Alliance | 99,000 Miles
EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for ?yyy Award Chart? (with ?yyy? being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you?re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this ? Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this ? Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control ? regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA?s award chart ? not LAN?s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the process that I use for determining the best redemption value for my points and miles, so hopefully it helps shed some light on how to find the best redemption value for your trip."
"2019-05-16 14:48:45"|"Award Flights to New Zealand Booking Experience"|"I currently live in New Zealand and have booked 15-20 USA-New Zealand J awards in the past 18 months using many programs. With the addition of AA and United flying nonstop, it has become less of a unicorn than it was. It does involve a little more planning. Here is a lot of the information that I have learned about the specific route and my general booking process.  I have included many booking options but ran out of steam to include them all. It may also ramble since it was mainly written to pass time without internet coverage in the car.

  
**Nonstop**  
**Air New Zealand (NZ)**  
This space is hard to come by in J. A little easier in Y. The best way to look for space is an Expert Flyer alert since availability tends to be random if it opens up at all. More likely, one seat to open up, but I have seen multiple. More offseason space released. YVR, SFO, LAX, IAH, ORD, HNL.   
**United (UA)**  
Nonstop year round SFO-AKL, during \~April-October it does not fly every day. They do open up J space randomly on this route. I have seen 8+ J seats available, but this is an exception, not the rule. Do not expect saver availability around Christmas. I have seen J space released to partners. SFO.   
**American (AA)**  
Nonstop LAX-AKL daily seasonal, roughly November-March. They do release space on this route, but the release is not predictable. Some are close in, and some are further out. I have seen a lot of married segment logic on this route. PHX is a good city to use if you are looking for a default city that shows most married segment logic. LAX.   
**Air Canada**  
Nonstop YVR-AKL, 4X week, mid-December- end March. This route is brand new (hasn?t been flown yet), but they have released some J space. I anticipate there will be some changes for the 2020/21 ?season? after they see how the route does. YVR. 

  
**Connections**  
Three main regions are used for connections to New Zealand: Australia, South Pacific, and Asia. Not all programs allow you to connect through all the regions. Almost all allow you to connect through Australia. If you are connecting through Australia on NZ a320/a321s they are a one cabin aircraft and do not have J (772, 773, and 787 do have J).

  
**Booking Through Award Programs**  
**AA**  
Their routing rules allow you to connect through the South Pacific and Australia to New Zealand, but not through Asia. AA is a pain to search since they often show a domestic F flight and a TPAC economy flight as a J award.  
Direct: Flying the seasonal AA LAX-SFO route  
Australia: Flying AA or Qantas to Australia and then Qantas to AKL, WLG, CHC, or ZQN. Qantas opens up flights \~360 days, which can reduce availability for AA at 330 days.   
Air Tahiti New: Decent availability has been showing in J without overnight connections when the schedule opens. Shows on AA?s website and flies to AKL.  
Fiji: Not the best product and availability is hit or miss. Remember to search for flights to AKL, WLG, and CHC since sometimes availability isn?t available on the final leg to each destination.  
Qatar: This counts as two awards and is in the process of getting Qsuites. Availability has been pretty decent for AKL-DOH in late 2018/early 2019.    
**ANA(NH)**  
This is the program that it is the easiest to find availability to New Zealand since they allow you to create your a routing with three connections. You have to fly TPAC, must book roundtrip, and are allowed one stopover. ANA?s search engine is pretty limited when searching, but you can use a multi-destination search to ?force? your routing. ANA?s search engine typically does not include flights that connect from the US to ICN, TPE, PEK, or PVG on their searches. Remember to search for AKL, WLG, CHC, and ZQN. It can be time intensive to find an award, but I have never not been able to piece together a J award. Singapore opens up a decent amount of space on their AKL-SIN and WLG-SIN (regional product).   
**Alaska (AS)**  
Alaska has a different award chart for each of their partners. You can mix Alaska flights with a partner, but you cannot use multiple partners on one ticket. You are allowed a stopover on a one-way award. This gives you more flexibility since your TPAC and flight to NZ can have availability on separate days.   
Cathay Pacific: Must be booked via phone, use BA or QF to find availability, but keep in mind CX often releases one less seat to AS than One World partners. AKL, CHC  
Fiji: Can be searched on AS. Availability is sometimes different than Expert Flyer. AKL, WLG, CHC  
Qantas: Can be searched on AS. AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN  
Korean: Must book roundtrip. Searchable on AS. AKL  
**Avianca/Lifemiles**  
I have seen a lot of restrictions on what routes you can book with Lifemiles to New Zealand. They tend to be more restrictive than UA and ANA, but I still have found availability with them. You generally cannot create your routing. They do allow Asia connections.   
**Cathay**  
You can get additional award availability if you book directly. AKL and CHC.   
**Delta**  
Delta does not fly to New Zealand, and the rates are typically extremely high. They are partners with Virgin Australia, and you can connect through Australia. China Eastern (PVG), China Southern (CAN), Korean (ICN), and China Airlines (TPE-BNE-AKL) are Sky Team members that fly to AKL.   
**JAL**  
The cheapest way to book Emirates from AKL. Leaving AKL the YQ (fuel surcharge) is pretty low. The other One World information applies, watch for YQ. The rates tend to be reasonable, but the miles are tough to get. You can book 360 days out and will have access to One World inventory 360 days out.  
**Qantas**  
The advantage of booking directly with Qantas is that you can book \~360 days out and they sometimes release availability at the start of the schedule for their US routes. There is YQ, and the mileage amounts are typically higher than booking via AA.  
**Singapore**  
Partner award rates are very high, and UA in most cases would be a better option. If you want to fly SQ TPAC in a premium cabin, you almost always need to book directly through SQ since they basically never release those seats to partners. Starting in 2018 it does seem that there are releasing a lot more J space to partners from SIN-AKL/WLG/Australia  
**United**  
UA lets you route through Asia to get to New Zealand. The routes that they allow are highly variable and hard to figure out. I recommend searching for many US cities and AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN. UA?s issues booking various Asian carriers award space has reduced space connecting in Asia. You cannot piece together your own award. You can currently waitlist flights on UA metal and prepay for them (not sure if this is/will be possible after November 15). I have had success on the AKL-SFO route with this clearing 48 hours before departure.   
**Virgin Atlantic (VS)**  
Most of the talk with VS is about booking ANA to Japan. They have a great rate on NZ metal of 62.5k in J between the US and New Zealand (transfer bonuses put this between 48-55k). The issue is that this is the unicorn flight (unless you are flying May-August). There is award space released randomly, and Expert Flyer is your best bet. I have managed to book this award before.  A good option for May-August when NZ released more space.

  
**Strategy**   
I first decide what is my optimal booking. Do I want to fly CX, nonstop, stopover in Asia/Fiji? Then I look at how many seats I am trying to book. I then figure out when award seats open up for my desired booking. If I am not at that date, I monitor what award seats become available and if I think it will open up at schedule opening. If the schedule is already open, I search to see if there is availability. If there isn?t, I search for other routes. If I cannot find any award availability that pops up in searching, there are 3 main options I consider.   
\-Booking with ANA via Asia. You can create your own itinerary, and as long as you can find a TPAC to somewhere in Asia you should be able to stitch together a routing. This does take some time. 

\-Set Expert Flyer alerts for every nonstop NZ, UA, and AA nonstop flight that would work. Space does come available randomly.   
\-If there is UA economy saver space, waitlisting J via UA.   


I am willing to book a one-way flight and wait for a return flight. The only exception is mid-December through mid-January.   
Through the entire process, I keep in mind how many tickets I am trying to book.   
1 ticket- Higher likelihood of NZ award seat becoming available. Higher likely of AA seat becoming available within 90 days.   
2 tickets- Nonstop flights are still a possibility. NZ frequently only releases 1 J seat on many of their Asia routes at schedule opening so I count on them. A very doable number.   
3+ tickets- This gets tricky. I have seen UA release I9, which is at least 9 J award seats. This is not normal. The ANA route can be a little more difficult with 3+. The TPAC will be your most challenging flight, followed by the last flight to New Zealand, but there are frequently 3+ seats between New Zealand and Australia. UA waitlist on separate PNRs is a good backup if you can find saver Y.

edit: A lot of the routing rules and general information of this post apply when flying to Australia since almost all award charts combing Australia and New Zealand in the same region. The capacity to Australia is about 4-5 times greater than New Zealand and I have not included a breakdown of flights to Australia."
"2019-06-19 07:05:46"|"Offered free Gold Status on AA for 3 months even though I typically fly United. Worth booking upcoming flights on AA instead of United?"|"I checked my e-mail today and found American Airlines offered me free gold status until 9/25. The promotion is to maintain gold through Jan 2021 by spending $850 EQD and going 7,000 EQMs by 9/25.

This came as a surprise as I am not a loyal AA flyer. I fly somewhat often for work, ranging from 3-6 days a month. I have 9.9K miles on AA, about 6K flown this year from trips to Vegas, Miami, and Boston.

&#x200B;

My upcoming trips (none of are booked yet):

\-RT DC to Madison for work (highly likely)

\-RT DC to Orlando for work

\-RT DC to San Francisco for work

\-1 way DC to Boston (other way is  on Jetblue, this was a personal trip so I went with who was cheaper)

&#x200B;

Looking at my trips above and roughly calculating cost, it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation. (I'll likely have one other work trip thrown in, but these are confirmed) which would get me to gold on AA through 2021. However, I typically fly United since I grew up near a hub and tried to stay somewhat loyal when convenient and/or affordable. I have 27K miles on United but not any status (and a RT flight to Spain booked on United). I was planning to book all of my above trips on United for this reason, to keep accruing miles.

&#x200B;

So my question is:

1. Should I switch plans and book all of my upcoming trips on AA instead of United to hit the promotion? Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?
2. Would it make sense to abandon loyalty to United and start flying AA going forward? I feel like if I switched to AA with the promotion I'm dividing up my miles and not really highly accruing on either (I'dbe about even on both airlines by Sept.)

&#x200B;

Some Notes:

\-I care more about being able to accrue miles (maybe to book a free trip in the near future) than say upgrades. The extra legroom perk would be nice since I'm tall but I wouldn't give up accruing more miles on one airline for that, especially since I can expense it for work flights on longer trips anyway.

\-I don't have a travel credit card except the Uber Barclays Card (3% cahs back regardless of brand).

\-I live close to DCA (an AA hub). United also flies out of DCA and has a hub in Dulles which isn't so far

\-I don't have strong feelings one way or the other about the brands. I've generally never had a problem on either.

\-For what it's worth, I'm silver on Marriott which has some kind of partnership with United

"2019-01-22 18:33:23"|"Chase Sapphire Reserve Partner Transfer"|"Hi,

I was trying to book a United awards flight using the 1:1 transfer from UR to MileagePlus. My wife and I have a combined points balance big enough for the flight.

   
I spent over an hour on the phone with United booking a flight that was a combination of an awards ticket and a paid ticket. When everything was all set up, they charged my credit card for the paid reservation, and said to call back quickly when my MileagePlus account had the appropriate amount of miles in it to complete the awards ticket.

&#x200B;

First issue, Chase would not allow me to transfer my wife's UR points (CSP) to my UR account (CSR) online so I had to call in. They said they do not know why it isn't working but there is nothing they can do. So I suggested that my wife and I both transfer our points from our UR respective accounts to my MileagePlus account. The agent at Chase said that this transfer is no longer instant and will likely take up to 7 days to populate in my MileagePlus account. 

&#x200B;

In total, There would have been five passengers flying on these two reservations (three paid, two on UR points), so a rate lock of $30 per passenger for 7 days seemed a bit steep. I canceled both reservations and booked at full fare with another airline.

&#x200B;

My questions:

Is what the Chase agent said true? I have transferred UR to MileagePlus points (years ago) and it was instant.

How do you book flights? Do you transfer points before booking the reservation so the points are readily available? Seems like that severely limits how we can use them when booking.

Is the CSR a garbage card now? No more price protection, Priority Pass in the US gets me laughed out of most lounges, and now allegedly non-instant points transfers?

&#x200B;

I like to travel and find a premium card's annual fee is worth while if the benefits are good. Is there a new card that I should be using? With that said, $150 per year after travel credit might be the best option for me?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your time!"

"2019-02-12 05:14:24"|"What's the catch for Wyndham rewards?"|"Hi everyone!

I did my Googling and also consulted the side panel but if this is not allowed please let me know! Not sure if this is the best place to ask.

I'm an ""entry-level"" frequent traveler and I am moderately into airline and credit card points. I'm often on United Gold status?just for context on my travels. I never really researched hotel points as I often book with Hotels.com for the de facto 10% off.

I just decided to start looking into hotels and decided that since most of my wife's business trips stay with IHG or Marriott properties, I should probably look into another program to maximize benefits when we travel together to visit family etc. I'm a freelancer?almost all of my travels are paid out-of-pocket. Wyndham has quite some lower-mid-tier brands like Wingate and La Quinta that I often stay with, so it looks like a good, if not less popular program to go with.

I understand that they have a blanket 15,000 points redeeming policy. Their points are also not difficult to accumulate since every stay guarantees at least 1,000. Their statuses, while not that rewarding, have pretty low requirements to reach. This sounds like a really great program especially when I can stay at higher tier properties for just 15,000 a night, with what they advertise as no blackout dates. So my question is?what's the catch? It couldn't be this good and easy, right? Or is it? And is there a better program that I should look into? (I have Hyatt and Marriott statuses through United but I don't stay with them often. I was looking into Hilton but their mid-tier products aren't as plenty as Wyndham.)

Thanks in advance for your insights!"
"2016-10-04 01:39:31"|"Booked award ticket, United changed it to a terrible itinerary. Do we have any recourse?"|"Hey guys,

My husband and I booked two economy award tickets from Queenstown to Anchorage in March.  Yesterday, about two weeks after booking, united sent us an email saying they changed the itinerary but we were still confirmed.

The first itinerary they booked for us arrived in Chicago at 4pm and then departed at 8am the same day (8 hours before arriving).  We called to change it and they said the only option was the following:

Queenstown - Auckland, Auckland - Oakland, Oakland - San Francisco, San Francisco - San Diego, San Diego - Denver, Denver - Anchorage, with a 16 hour layover in San Francisco and an overnight layover in San Diego. This is approximately 56 hours of travel, as opposed to 36 with the original itinerary.  The CSR claimed this was the only option for any date in early March.  United.com shows no award availability remaining for March.

This seems like a load of hooey to me (but par for the course with my experience with united).  We have already transferred our UR points to united to book this ticket, so it seems we're stuck with them.

Does anybody have any suggestions for how to wrangle a more manageable itinerary from my least favorite airline?  Thanks in advance.

"2016-05-02 18:38:52"|"Award Tickets 202: How To Book A ""One-Way"" Award Ticket Using ANA Miles"|"Let me start off by saying that I do not advocate for anyone doing ""throw away ticketing"", but with that said, there have been a few questions here over the past few months asking about one-way award tickets using ANA miles. As a result, I decided to put together a little guide for how to technically book a one-way award ticket using ANA miles. The [original post with pictures can be found here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-202-one-way-award-tickets-on-ana/). If it seems like I missed anything, please feel free to let me know!

I will start with a brief primer on ANA for those that are not familiar with the airline, their transfer partners or their award chart. ANA?s award chart underwent a devaluation of sorts approximately a year ago. While devaluations are bad in general, the changes really were not that bad in the big scheme of things.

ANA also offers what is largely considered one of the best first class products in the sky.

[ANA First Class](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-2.jpg?w=480)

As well as a great (albeit boring color combination) business class product.

[ANA Business Class](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-3.jpg?w=930)

In addition, you can use ANA miles to book award tickets on any of the Star Alliance partner airlines. These include:

[ANA Star Alliance Partners](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-4.png?w=576)

As you can see, there are quite a few options for your award redemptions ? and that translates into value!

**EARNING ANA MILES**

ANA partners with both American Express and SPG, so both your Membership Rewards points and your SPG Starpoints can be transferred to ANA. Your Membership Rewards points will transfer to ANA at a 1:1 ratio.

[Membership Rewards Points to ANA Miles Transfer Ratio](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-5.png?w=1022)

While your SPG points will also transfer at a 1:1 ratio.

[Starpoints to ANA Miles Transfer Ratio](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-7.png?w=662)

Remember, if you transfer in chunks of 20k Starpoints, you will earn a 5k mile bonus so make sure you are taking full advantage of this!

[Starpoint Transfer Bonus](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-6.png?w=988)

**ANA'S AWARD CHART**

Like most airlines these days, ANA uses two different award charts ? one for flights operated by ANA, and one for flights operated by their partners.

The [award chart for flights operated by ANA](http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/amc/reference/tukau/kokusai.html) uses a low, regular and high season system where you award costs will vary according to the date(s) of your flight(s). This will vary depending on the year, your origin and your destination, so it is worth reviewing before you transfer your hard earned Starpoints or Membership Rewards points.

The [award chart for flights operated by ANA?s partners](http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/amc/reference/tukau/teikeiair_1.html) uses a zone based system with no difference in redemption cost due to the date(s) of your travel(s).

**IMPORTANT NOTES ON ANA AWARD TICKET RULES**

It is worth noting that if your itinerary includes both ANA flights and a partner flight, you will be subject to the ANA partner award chart.

[ANA Rule](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-9.png?w=593)

It also important to know that ANA (much like Korean Air) only allows you to redeem miles for your family members ? all of whom you will have to register (up to 10) in advance of ticketing your award ticket. This is how ANA defines ?family members?:

[ANA Family Members](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-8.png?w=611)

Lastly, ANA requires that you book a round-trip ticket. You will notice there is no option to select on the award search page for a one-way ticket.

[ANA Main Search Page](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-10.png?w=752)

The relevant rule states that the departure airport and the final destination on the itinerary may differ, but must be in the same country.

[ANA Rule](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-11.png?w=667)

This is very important language and the key to being able to book a one-way award ticket using your ANA miles!

**HOW TO BOOK A ONE-WAY AWARD**

Given the language of the rule, that means an itinerary that went Orlando (MCO) to Chicago (ORD) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on the outbound and Tokyo Narita (NRT) to New York (JFK) on the return would be a valid routing because you both departed from, and returned to, the same country ? the United States.

[ANA Valid Open-Jaw Routing](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-12.png?w=588)

That routing in economy would cost you 55,000 miles. Not a great redemption, but also not a horrible redemption all things considered.

[ANA Redemption Rate](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-13.png?w=963)

But what about if you actually just need the first segment from Orlando (MCO) to Tokyo Narita (NRT)? There is no option to search for a one-way award ticket, so you need to get a bit creative. Remember how the award ticket rules only said you had to return to the country you departed from? That means you can tack on a flight from somewhere like Monterrey Mexico (MTY) to Houston (IAH) to make your ticket a round-trip!

[ANA ""One-Way"" Routing](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-14.png?w=966)

As you can see, this satisfies the award ticket rules, and will only cost you 42,500 miles in economy. The segment from Monterrey (MTY) to Houston (IAH) will be a throw away ticket (i.e., one you have no intention of actually flying), but you could also use it down the road for the return segment of a later trip!

If you are returning to the United States, Air Canada and United usually have pretty good availability from Canada or Mexico to United?s hubs in the United States. Just keep plugging in your city pairs until you find something that has space available.

Again, this option will not necessarily create great value, but can be a good value if you run into a situation where you have one portion of your trip already booked, but cannot find one-way saver level award space on any airline that you have miles with. With a bit of creativity and knowledge/research on Star Alliance flights, you can really get this to work to your advantage if you are in a situation where you need a one-way award ticket that only ANA is showing availability for.

**Final Thoughts**

Not only does ANA offer some very generous redemption rates and routing rules, but they also offer a great product. While I do not generally recommend that travelers skirt the award ticket rules or book flights they have no intention of actually flying, this trick actually does comply with the ANA award ticket rules (not factoring in the throw away ticketing). Hopefully this helps give you some ideas for how to redeem your miles for a one-way ANA award ticket!"
"2017-01-30 01:33:18"|"Trying to go to New Zealand from Boston for our honeymoon, need some help!"|"My fiance and I are getting married this September and want to go to New Zealand for our honeymoon (probably in Feb/March 2018 when it's summer there). We live in MA. 


With flights being a god damn $1400+ per person, I'm now looking into a good miles card! My credit score is 750, so I pretty much have all options available to me. We do not really travel much, so this needs to be something I can get with regular bills/expenses. 


Do these cards typically only work for certain airlines? I've been checking Skyscanner and most of the cheaper flights are via United. I don't want to get an airline specific card only for the ticket prices to be $2k each and only get a little bit of money off that ends up being the same price or more as a United flight. How does this work?

I read[ this thread over](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/55wyli/guide_to_a_cheap_vacation_for_newbies/) on /r/churning and found it great - should I get those first two cards? 

Or is there a better plan to get a decent discount? 

Thanks! "

**Backstory** - I'm a US expat and travel hacker living in Sydney with my wife. We've been here for 6 months and seen a lot of the same questions about the area get posted almost daily. I'll do my best to concisely run through a number of topics here, whether it be about getting here or what to do, in the hopes this makes future questions a little more tactical.  
  
##NOTE: PLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE! 
###Update 1 - Added booking windows and intra-region travel info. 

##Getting Here
###Cash
Great deals to be had lately in economy. Prices have consistently dropped $800 or so from mainland USA on full service carriers. These sales are pretty frequent. If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve card a $800 cash ticket is just over 53,000 Ultimate Rewards points with FULL points earn on the ticket itself. That's a great deal if you don't care about sitting up front.  
Business class is significantly more expensive. This is one of the most sought after premium class routes on the planet and with that prices tend to stay high and award availability low. 

####From the East Coast of the US  
I highly recommend AA to DFW and Qantas DFW-SYD. The route is served by a comfortable A380 (good economy, dated 2-2-2 J though) and loads are typically intentionally kept low heading East to maximize cargo capacity. That means you can realistically expect a empty middle seat if you plan well. On the eastbound side it's still possible but less likely. Also, if you fly on low days you may score an upgrade for $1,000 - $1,200 USD per person, per way, via Qantas' bid for upgrade program. Really the major benefit here is connections going further into the US - minimizing travel time on either side of that long leg is incredibly more valuable and comfortable.

####From the West Coast of the US
Any carrier works here, chose based on your preference. Every domestic carrier serves the route (UA/AA/DL) and most are newer aircraft (sans Delta's aging 777s). You can also find good deals via Fiji as well as via Auckland on Air New Zealand. I personally don't like breaking up the trip any more than necessary so I don't like those options.  

###Points  
Oh boy, this is a good one. Generally the rule of thumb is simply this, **PLAN AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO FLY UP FRONT!** The only exception to this is Virgin Australia who sometimes releases J space < 2 weeks of travel. That's absolutely rolling the dice though. Economy wise you can typically find space on at least one carrier so that's less of a topic, and as above, with cash prices being so low it can often be less worthwhile to book the award itself.  
Up front you really have a few options.   
 &nbsp;  

**US Carriers**  
 &nbsp;  
  
Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---
United | 338 | Good J hard product, meh soft product. Awards open up here and there but typically it's very limited to last minute redemption. Price-wise, they're not the cheapest, but not the most expensive.  
AA | 331| probably the best hard produce from the group. Same meh soft product (they're US carriers after all). Pricing is also okay, but availability is next to none.  
Delta | 331| bad products, hard and soft. The seats are old, the service is older. Price is highest BUT you will often find saver-level seats on Virgin Australia (a partner) < 2 weeks out.  
   &nbsp;  
**Australian Carriers**  
 &nbsp;

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Qantas| 353 | meh J product (2-2-2). Good/Great F. Service is also good, very polished. Availability in spurts, but okay price via AA.   
Virgin Australia | 330 | best seat (the Business) and I'm a sucker for a bird with a bar. Conversely, terrible availability unless you're looking within 2 weeks or right at the window. 
 &nbsp;  
**Asian Carriers (generally better availability)**  
 &nbsp;  

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Korean | 360? | my personal favorite. Great airline, great US service, and a transfer partner of Chase. And most importantly, they tend to be quite generous with their availability. 
Cathay | 360 | old favorite in the points world. Not the cheapest option but if you have the points then you'll often find availability through HKG when you book at the window. Great seat, classic service, and AMAZING lounges in HKG. 
JAL | 330 | like ANA, in light of recently US carrier devaluations these guys have become a viable option through Tokyo. Some recommend their 777 SkySuite as the best J product out there. 
SQ | 355 | Suites are always a favorite but lately it's pretty impossible to not pull your hair out before actually confirming that route. J availability tends to show up here and there. Recently devauled though so use tool to find best option based on points available. 
ANA | 356 | mentioned in JAL topic, just a solid all around option if you have the points. 
 &nbsp;  
**Award Tools**  
Look, I know a lot of carriers were mentioned above and you're probably going well, that's all great, but how do I ultimately choose one given the fact that I have a trip 1+ year out and a few options? That's where the below sites come in handy. They will tell decipher award charts and help you distill down the airlines that you can realistically fly given the points that you have.

##Once In The Region
###Intra-Region Travel 
  
* Staying in the South/South East (SYD/BNE/MEL/PER/etc.) - Avios, Avios, Avios! SYD-MEL, for example, is 4,500 Avios one way on Qantas. This is an amazing sweet spot. 
* Cross Country Travel - This is tough. Economy prices aren't terribly high, but the business class product on these flights is top notch. Virgin flies ""The Business"" A330 and Qantas flies an equivalent A330 through the continent and they really cater to those premium travelers. I still haven't come up with the best way of doing this with points though local frequent flyers swear by the points upgrade to get up front. 
* Across the Ditch (To/From NZ) - My recommendation is Air New Zealand. I recently booked this and spent 25k Krisflyer (Singapore) for a RT flight on Air New Zealand. I definitely consider that tremendous value, though discount carriers operate these routes and you can find deals (I would consider $300 round trip in economy to be a good deal).

###Sydney-Specific
Rule of thumb, if you have 5+ days in the region than I suggest going outside of Sydney. It's a cool city, but there is SO much more to see. Scroll down for details, but while in Sydney here are a few suggestions:

* Taronga Zoo ? One of my favourites. A great place to see all the local animals that the US doesn?t have. **This is a FANTASTIC first day activity and will help you fight jet lag!**
* Bondi to Cogee Walk ? A beautiful self-guided walk down the coast. It?s just a walking path but it's a must do. 
* Harbour Bridge Climb ? Climb atop Sydney?s most famous bridge to see the city like nowhere else. Younger people love it, older people tend to avoid it. I haven't done it and don't plan to. 
* Sydney Opera House ? The most famous landmark in Sydney. We could see a show or just do a tour. Up to you.
* Manly Ferry/Beach ? Manly beach is amazing and the surrounding area is filled with bars and restaurants. This would take up the majority of a day. The ferry there and back is a mini sightseeing tour in and of itself.
* Sydney Bus Tours - Highly recommended as it takes you all over the city and even out to Bondi. Hop on/Hop off style so you can wander if you like a stop.
* Sydney Boat Tours ? Just like the bus tours, the boat tours allow you to get off at stops and explore. A great way to maneuver around the water and hit the main points of interest. Could be a good way to see Manly, too. Do NOT do a dinner cruise, the food is bad and it's just a waste of time. 
* The Rocks ? Located right in the harbour, the Rocks is an area with numerous restaurants, a famous market and Australia?s oldest pubs.
* Darling Harbour ? Like the Rocks, DH is another touristy area on the water that has a ton of restaurants and bars. Also has a Ferris wheel, an enormous fish market with tons of fresh seafood, and a casino.
* Sydney Seaplanes ? Name says it all. I absolutely LOVED the ""Sydney Secrets"" tour. 
* Featherdale Wildlife Park ? Never been here but it comes highly recommended. Basically it is an animal park where all of the animals are loose and you can interact with them. All of the Australian animals will be there. It is a little bit of a drive but definitely doable.
* Blue Mountains ? A national park that has a bunch of beautiful views and is much different from the water you get all around the city. They have a similar bus tour to all the attractions which lets you hop on/off at will. A train will take us directly up there if you?d like to go.
* Hunter Valley ? Australia is known for its wine and HV is the closest region to the city.
  
**Places to Stay**
  
* Park Hyatt Syndey - go to place for best of the best stays. On Cirqular Quay with views of Opera House. 
* Westin Sydney - downtown, good location (10 min walk from quay), nice hotel. 
* Hilton Sydney - downtown, same as Westin. 
* Intercontinental Double Bay - ritzy area of town, looks to be a nice hotel. I live nearby so I'm biased - it's a good spot but out of the hustle and bustle. 
* Marriott - also downtown, 5 min from quay. Lobby recently redone, rooms are supposedly very nice, too. 
* Four Points Sydney - closer to Chinatown but still downtown. 20 min qay to quay. I've heard it's nice.
* There are tons more, this is a whole topic in an of itself.

###Regional
**Are you outdoorsy?**  
 
* Queenstown, NZ (~3 hour flight) - The end all be all go-to place for being outdoors. If you like being outside/hiking/etc. this should absolutely be on your list See extreme activities section.
* Tasmania - 
* Blue Mountains - see above. 
* Royal National Park (~30 min from Sydney) - great national park with some beautiful hiking spots. Not huge, but easy to get to and is a good excursion.

**Do you like food/drinks?**   

* Melbourne (pronounced Melbun) - Where to begin? Really the best way of thinking about Sydney vs. Melbourne, which is a HUGE rivalry by the way, is to put it simply as > Sydney has the sights whereas Melbourne has the culture. 

**Extreme activities?**   

* Cairnes (pronounced Cans) - the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. Backpacker town (if you want a nicer area near the GBR see Port Douglas) and full of bars and nightlife. If you're younger, want to hang out with some peers, and go diving, go here. 
* Queenstown - the extreme sports capital of the world or something like that. Has it all - skiing, skydiving, bungee jumping, rafting, etc. 

**Animals**
  
* Featherdale Wildlife Park - Near Sydney, see above section. 
* Taronga Zoo - see Sydney section.
* Austrlaia Zoo - Up near Sunshine Coast, not familiar with it. 
  
**Cultural**  
  
* Melbourne - see food.   
* Uluru - Where Ayers Rock is. Great for the ""Outback"" experience. Can fly (3 hrs) from Sydney, not/nothing else there though. 
  
**Beaches/Relaxation**  
  
* Lord Howe Island - limited access island. Super exclusive. Best value is booking out and using Qantas points to get there. 16k or so round trip for $1,000 flight.   
* Hamilton Island - right off barrier reef's southern end. Beautiful islands with Whitsundays islands nearby.  
* Port Douglas - the nicer way to get to the Great Barrier Reef (as opposed to touristy/backpacker Cairns).  
* Bondi/Bronte/Coogee/etc. - Eastern beaches. All near Syndey. Bondi to Coogee walk will show you most of them.  
* Northern Beaches (30 - 45 min car ride from city). More laid back beaches outside of the city. Slower paces, friendlier locals. 

##Example Itinerary##
Assumes 10 days down under.
  
* Day 1 - Land in SYD, drop bags at hotel, change, and head straight to Zoo. DO NOT NAP. Try to stay awake until 7p or so. Good luck.
* Day 2 Sydney - Hop on/Hop off bus tour. Do Bondi to Coogee walk when you get to Bondi. Figure out what you like and don't like along the way.
* Day 3 Travel to Melbourne - Dinner downtown. 
* Day 4 Melbourne - Coffee, walk around CBD, Great Ocean Road maybe?
* Day 5 Travel to Queenstown, NZ
* Day 6 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 7 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 8 Travel to Sydney 
* Day 9 Sydney - Opera House tour. Ferry to Manly for lunch/afternoon. 
* Day 10 Depart Sydney

"2018-10-11 18:28:55"|"Air China or Singapore Airlines for business class?"|"I'm going to Bali next year in May. I live in the DC area but sometimes fly out of JFK if there are good flight deals. If I book through United (one way flight) for 90k miles + $25 I can fly business class all the way. That would include 2 Air China flights and 1 Singapore Airlines flight. There are a few different trips for that amount and they range from 30-34 hours total travel time. 

Or I can fly out of JFK and take all Singapore Airlines flights (one way flight). For 135,000 miles + $36.50 I can fly business class all the way. Total travel time would be 26-27 hours depending on which flights I take. 

I just wasn't that impressed with Air China's business class seats from the pictures and videos I've seen online. This will be my first really long flight and I just really want the best experience. What would you do? What are your thoughts on Air China's business class and Singapore Airlines business class?"

"2017-02-23 23:19:49"|"What's the best way to book my Hawaii trip in July? (UR, SPG, United)"|"First time booking award travel! I'm flying out from the Bay Area (SFO) to attend a wedding in Maui July 1 - July 7-9 (flexible when I come back) and I'm looking to book via awards points. What's the best value for points I can get?

My current balances:
Chase Ultimate Rewards: 232,693
SPG: 47,587
United: 86,948

Looking on travel booking through Ultimate Rewards, I can find the following flights:

SFO -> HNL, July 1
HNL -> SFO July 7
46,828 pts

SFO -> HNL, July 1
HNL -> SFO July 8
50,162 pts

SFO -> HNL, July 1
HNL -> SFO July 9
50,427 pts

And through United:

SFO -> HNL, July 1
HNL -> SFO July 7
67,500 miles + $11.20 (this seems ridiculously high to me)


Is there anything else I'm missing? I know I can transfer points one to one from UR or SPG to a lot of other airlines, but kind of a noob on how to actually find appropriate flights and then do the transfer.

If these are all bad deals, I don't mind paying for the actual ticket and saving the points for a better redemption.

Thanks!

I figured May would be a good time to visit Vancouver and want to make sure I am utilizing my points well.

I have 340K UR, and 55K MR.

&#x200B;

SAN - YVR

Air Canada via United: 25K UR round trip

Hyatt Regency Vancouver: 12K a night

&#x200B;

My main questions are:

1. Is there better option to get a flight ticket? Would British Airway have a better option if I call?
2. 12K a night Hyatt vs AirBnB?

&#x200B;

Any suggestion is much appreciated!

&#x200B;

EDIT:  for future San Diego homies.

Just called BA to book Alaska airline using AVIOS points.   
SAN - PDX - YVR would be calculated separately.  
SAN - PDX = 7.5K  
PDX - YVR = 7.5K  
SAN - PDX - YVR = 15K total one way  
Not worth. On the other hand. LAX - YVR would be one way 7.5K and totally worth!"
"2017-09-06 03:29:15"|"Experience booking Emirates Business through JAL"|"I made my first major award redemption today (yay me!) by booking two business class seats on Emirates through Japan Airlines (JAL) from the US to India and back. 

Prior to my reservations, I had about 159.5k SPG Points, 300k+ UR, 85k TYP, and around 140k AA miles. I was open to the idea of buying more points/miles to compensate any deficit and travel a little more comfortably as two economy tickets were going to cost me roughly $2000 anyway.

After having scoured the inter webs, I found a good number of options for booking these flights. Here's the breakdown of a few that I found:

- SPG points to Alaska to book on Cathay Pacific at 125k miles RT per person [decent, but I didn't quite like Cathay's business class product. Also, the HKK to India route was on Cathay Dragon.]

- American to fly either Qatar or Etihad at 140k miles RT per person [I could have moved my SPG points or bought AA miles. Didn't care too much to spend 280k miles on the flights, though. Approx. 3c/mile value]

- United to book Lufthansa at 160k miles RT per person [I wouldn't have minded flying Lufthansa, but that would mean I'd have to spend almost 320 UR OR buy and move a bunch of SPG points and that seemed a waste. Approx. 2.6c/mile value]

- SPG points to JAL to book on Cathay Pacific/Emirates/Qatar at 100k miles RT per person [This worked out the best as I had to transfer only 160k SPG points and was the cheapest in terms of redemption]

My first preference going into this was Qatar Airways because of the lie flat seats offered in the 777-ER, as well as the more modern design of the interiors in the aircraft. Unfortunately, I could not find availability on the dates that I needed - we weren't terribly constrained but could not find anything within a couple of weeks even. That left Emirates. 

I transferred 60k SPG points per day to JAL to ensure I received the additional 5k for every 20k. It took exactly 5 days for each transfer to appear in my JAL account.

With my 200k JAL miles, I called their phone reservation number (1-800-JAL-FONE (1-800-525-3663*)) only to be kept on hold for 40 minutes. I also lost network before I could make my reservations, which meant calling back and enduring another 30 minute wait. 

The agent who took my call was extremely friendly and was appreciative of the fact that I had all my flight information ready at hand. My flights were booked in all of 8 minutes, 2 of which went in making sure she spelt my wife's name correctly (the missus has a longish name). The agent wasn't able to ticket our reservations immediately because my wife and I do not share the same last name and for some reason, she needed proof of marriage. Easy enough to provide by scanning and emailing them our marriage certificate. Within a few minutes of doing so, our tickets were confirmed and I was able to select seats on the Emirates website. 

All in all, a pretty awesome experience. I wish I didn't have to wait that long on the phone to make my reservations, but I'll live with it for now. Taking into consideration the taxes and fees for the flights [$137 for both of us] and the $17.5 I spent on the 500 extra SPG points, I'm getting a value of a little over 5c/point on SPG [based on today's fares for the same flight] which I think is pretty decent. 

Now, I need to start replenishing my SPG account.

Update: I realized that I did not mention that I used Qantas and Alaska Air to look for award availability. I also signed up at Expert Flyer for more information.

For anyone attempting this, I'd suggest looking for flights one sector at a time. A lot of the flights I saw on Alaska and Qantas had mixed cabin availability which doesn't lead to a full business class experience."

I am going to be flying monthly to Hong Kong and the US (Chicago & NYC) for the foreseeable future and I need to figure out which airline to commit to. I am currently Gold/Silver on American/United. My options are flying on Cathay Pacific vs United and the flight timings are quite similar. I want to factor in quality of their business seats AND the quality of their top end rewards program. One thing I am curious about is getting elite status on both Marco Polo Club AND American if I fly Cathay vs just 1K on United.

 * United for 160k miles  
 * Japan Airlines for 155k miles  
 * Cathay Pacific for 220k miles  
  
First of all, is there any airline I've overlooked?  Second, which of the recommended airlines offers the best premium cabin product?  I've seen that united doesn't have aisle access for all premium cabin seats, which makes me less interested in flying united for such a long flight."

I live in Southern California, and John Wayne Airport is the closest option for me.  I do fly LAX but only when I need to.  Since JWA isn't a major hub, I tend to fly different airlines.  I have 40-80k points on United, American, and Delta (each) and I don't think at this rate I'll ever get upgraded to first class or get free flights if I'm not doing things correctly.  I also have 60k points with Marriott.

I know I'm not traveling a ton, but I do go on 2-3 trips per month, so I figure that's enough that could add up.  

Can I convert points from one airline or hotel to another?

I'm thinking of consolidating and trying my best to only fly American.  Is this a good idea?

How do I make sure to maximize my benefits in the future?  Can I earn airline miles from my hotel stays and rental cars?  

My ultimate goal would be to get free airline tickets for my family.  If I can get upgraded seats during business travel, I wouldn't object - but the priority is getting free tickets for my wife and kids."

| Location/Flights |Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
Etihad First Class Apartments - JFK-AUH-MLE | 115k AA miles | First time flying with Etihad, the Apartments were impressive. I love the menu, I had a little bit of everything. I had seat 4A and it was pretty comfy for me, despite it not fully recline it was still good. I like how the partition came down for seats 3A and 4A, friend and I played Smash Bros throughout the flight. First time taking a shower in the air, it seems unreal. Tried to get a tour of the Residence but they used it as storage so no tour.
W Maldives | 240k Marriott Points 5 nights |I originally had StR booked but since I went there before I really wanted to experience a new property. Originally booked into a beach villa but got upgraded to overwater villa, I think having Plat helped. I?m not a huge of the hut style overwater villa look, I much prefer StR?s modern design. W?s overwater villa desk is very very impressive. Room is much smaller than StR but still nice. My only complaint is that the rough construction material of the pool gave me a few cuts throughout my stay. Also breakfast not was an impressive as StR. Budgeted $4000 but only endeding up spedning around $2k. Thank the churning gods for the Marriott Plat from the ritz. Also a very very interesting note about trying to extend my stay below.
SriLankan Air|14.k Avios MLE-CMB-SIN|This has been my usual route leaving or going to MLE. After fees, it was a bit over $100. For those who don?t want to pay a full fare like me might want to take a look at this route.
JW Marriott Singapore South Beach|50k Marriott Cert from Ritz card|Needed a night in Singapore so I opted to use my Ritz cert as I didnt want to pay for a night at Marina Bay Sands. Very very nice hotel. The pool has a great view of downtown Singapore. Breakfast was a good option as well. I?d stay here again. Not much else to stay as I got in late and left the next day.
SQ First Class Suites(new suites) - SIN-LHR|210k SQ Miles|I figured since I was so close to Singapore, I might as well try and go for the new Suite Class. Saver waitlist and Standard opened up for SIN-LHR, as I did not know how I?m getting back to JFK yet, I did not want to wait it out for Saver so I opted to do a full standard award.The suite is so much spacious than Etihad. Not a huge fan of the chair mainly because the old suites? chair was very very very comfy. The bed itself is a bit wider than Etihad. I got seat 2A, was hoping no one was in 1A for double beds but someone was there. The FA indulged me and made the double beds for me upon landing in LHR. It looks fantastic. I don?t see how you don?t want to try to join the mile high with the two beds, let alone the huge ass bathroom.
Lufthansa First Class - LHR-FRA-HND|115k UA Miles, $300ish in fees|So I was in LHR, figured I could find a way back home to JFK easily but I realized I was in Europe and could position myself to FRA to check out Lufthansa First Class. Originally thought to grab LH back from to JFK but its a short ass flight, not enough to enjoy it. I was looking at other longer route options. My friend did want to go back to Tokyo and potentially I could fly back to Asia and meet up with him. 2 weeks on the dot, United saw LH F availability to HND, I booked that shit asap. LH?s First Class Terminal is impressive, the personal attendant made me feel extra rich. Bathroom is not as impressive as Cathay?s Cabanas. I indulged in a whiskey tasting with their full bar. Man was I drunk. I was so drunk I didn?t realize we took off on the flight. My personal favorite is being driven to the 747 queen of the skies. The personal handling to the car from immigration and checking in was so cool. I got seat 2k up in the front of nose. I realize this wasn?t the best seat for photos due to the angle and I had to use some space from my neighbor. He never said anything but I like my personal space so I don?t like taking up anyone elses. Slept for most of the flight, never drinking that much whiskey again an hour before flight time.
Hyatt Regency Tokyo|12k Hyatt points|Meet up with my friend in Tokyo. He was staying 5 nights so I booked the first night under my name and 4 nights under his. Got him club room access and a Mt Fuji view, I came in the second night. Very very nice looking lobby. Can?t say much else cause I didn?t do anything else there beyond sleep. As my last time in Tokyo, I got a membership to Wagyumafia and I was putting it to full use. I?m able to bring a guest in for dinner with me and had a 10 courses of wagyu with a huge ribeye to share for main course. We could not finish it. $600 dinner for two. Only stayed 30 hours in Tokyo, my shortest stay and fifth time in Tokyo.
Japan Airlines - NRT-JFK|80k AA Miles|Finally heading back home. Not much to say as I flew with them before. Classic Japanese customer service nothing but good things. Though cabin temp was a bit on the warmer side. They ran out of the Queen of the Blue tea, guess everyone drank it all, I certainly did. It was a full cabin 6/6. 



**Notes**

? This trip was mainly about taking advantage of Marriott?s 60k rate before it went up. Round the world trip just happened to happen.


?Most of the flights did not come together until 2 weeks out. It was fun piecing together this trip in such a short time.

?Entire route, JFK-AUH-MLE-CMB-SIN-LHR-FRA-HND-JFK 

?Btw picking SQ Suites or Etihad Apartment, I'd go for the Suites. Much roomier, SQ service and bed is a bit wider. I nearly fell over on Etihad.

?I checked off 3 new first class flights off my list, that was fun. Would love to LH again.

?Including my friend's flights/stay, this vacation retailed over $100k. I can now say I've been on a $100k vacation.


**W Maldives Extended Stay notes**


So I fucked up on my dates and ended up checking out early than I thought. Ended up staying one night in Male City. Heres the interesting part, the W welcome manager gave me the rates if I wanted to stay extra. Of course I did not want to pay cash so I said no. A little way later he called back and asked if I declined because of the rates and no award stay was available, I said yes and he said he?ll contact Marriott to see if he can release a room. W was at full capacity so no beach villas was available too. He said due to their ?threshold? they could not release any more rooms and needed Marriott?s permission. They were trying to upsell a WOW escape suite to a upcoming guest, if he took it, I could?ve kept my overwater, if not, they could?ve moved me over to the WOW suite. Of course Marriott would deny this cause they would?ve needed to reimburse W at the suite rate. This was very interesting bit of news to me.

"2019-07-30 23:59:25"|"South Africa Award Booking Success"|"I just finished booking five people (myself, fiancee, her parents, and her brother) to South Africa for 12 days in May/June 2020. This is their first-ever family trip outside of North America. My fianc?e has flown J and F several times, but the others have never flown J or F. 

**Flights to Cape Town**

* Four people are flying Qatar Airways Business Class from ORD to CPT with 15.5-hour layover in Doha for 75k AA + $19 per person (reserved a quad QSuite).

* One person flying is Qatar Airways Business Class from JFK to CPT with a 1-hour layover in Doha for 75k AA + $15. 

* QSuites is on both the US to DOH routes.


**Flights Back from JNB to USA**

* Fiancee's parents and myself are flying Etihad Business from JNB-ORD with a four-hour layover in AUH for 75k AA + $67 per person (no QSuites awards available to any US airport 331 days out for +- 2 days)(I also added a flight on AA first from ORD to LAX on her parents' award by calling in). 

* Edit: Switched Fiancee's parents from JNB-LAX on Etihad J. 

* Fiancee is flying JNB- Sao Paulo in SA Business, then Sao Paulo to Toronto in Air Canada business, and then Air Canada Economy to San Diego for 80k United + $80. (the goal is to get to LA, but LA was 190k and San Diego was 80k. We are still going to continue to monitor award space to try to improve it.)

* Fiancee's brother is flying JNB-ADD-FRA-HND-ORD. Two segments are in ANA FIRST Class and two segments are in Ethiopian ?Cloud-Nine? business class (2-2-2 on A350-900). He will have a 7-hour layover in Frankfurt to experience the Lufthansa Senator Lounge and 4 hours in Tokyo-Haneda to experience the Suites Lounge. The total cost was only 103,000 Lifemiles plus $122 in taxes and fees. (Manual booking via email; really happy I got him two segments in ANA F in a single one-way award since he will be graduating from medical school right before this trip)

**Total Cost for 5 People=** 600k AA, 80k UA, and 103k LifeMiles plus $484 in taxes and fees plus about $100 to buy some extra LifeMiles.

**Things I Learned in the Process**

* LifeMiles has really relaxed routing rules. You just have to make sure the connections are less than 24 hours and your one-way trip is less than four calendar days (They rejected JNB-IST-FRA-HND-ORD since that trip would be last four days). 

* For LifeMiles, search each segment on their website and put together a few potential routings. I then emailed them several as my first, second, and third choice group of routings (support@lifemiles.com).  It takes 2-3 days to do a manual booking so award space could disappear in the process, which is why you should send multiple potential routings. It can take longer if you request near the weekend since the person who prices it doesn't work on the weekend. It also took me 5 calls over 3 days to pay the taxes and fees since there is only one guy who handles that and at many times he was busy or on break.

* After your LifeMiles award is on hold, transfer or buy points during a sale to get to the required amount. The rate that LifeMiles quotes to sell you points as the ?flexible payment? option is pretty high. I was short 10,000 miles, so I transferred 5k and bought 5k at around 1.6 cents rather than the quoted 3.2 cents.

*  The website Flight Connections is really helpful for creating LifeMiles awards since it shows you where airlines/alliances fly. I knew I wanted to try to get ANA First class, so I found award space to the USA and then worked my way backwards using Flight Connections for possible routings from there (and then checked award space). 

* For United, check nearby airports for awards. We saved 110k miles by routing from JNB to San Diego over LAX due to their new dynamic award pricing. 

* There is a lot of phantom award space on AA.com with Qatar and Etihad, so be sure to click all the way through to the payment screen to verify. 

* ~~AA or Etihad seems to be blocking award on Etihad to LAX. Etihad's system shows 2 ""Guest Business"" seats and AA.com errors out when you try to book them (call center can't book either).~~ Edit: Called the Australia call center and they switched the award to JNB-AUH-LAX thanks to everyone's comments. 

* For AA, all the segments must be 331 days out. I tried to book US-CPT on the 331st day, but I had to wait until 330 days to book the entire thing do to the second segment being a day later.

* AA online award hold is really helpful and you can hold an award for about 4-5 days. I found it helpful since you could add domestic positioning segments on AA metal to the award on hold that could not be booked online as one award. I also learned I  could have used the award hold to reserve the US to DOH in QSuites segment and then called in the next day to reserve the DOH to CPT segment (on the 330th day at midnight, award space was disappearing fast as people were booking the entire one-way flight).

* It is really helpful to use BA's award booking system (which can see award space much further out than AA) to see what will become available on the 331st day on AA.com.

* QSuites does not operate on the PHL route in the summer. That route had a lot of award space in the older business class. I also learned that a free Expert Flyer account can see the seat map (a lot of people think you need the paid subscription) or you could search US to DOH on QatarAirways.com and look for a gray Q icon next to business class price (or click the business class price and look at the picture).

* There seems to be never any QSuites award space to/from LAX. 

Overall it should be a great trip. We are planning on spending 5-6 days in Capetown and the remainder for a safari somewhere.  If you have any safari recommendations, please let me know."
"2019-04-04 19:38:04"|"Award flights to South Korea seem really difficult"|"We're looking at PDX - ICN (Seoul) in about a year, ideally in business but premium economy in Air Canada might work too depending upon aircraft type.  Overall, it seems like one of the toughest award routes to book when controlling for first world countries:

&#x200B;

\-Korean Air, which is notorious for having the toughest award availability

\-Air Canada, which is slightly easier but rarely competitive compared to Tokyo/Singapore

&#x200B;

We'll have a random mix of miles and points (120K in MR, 60K in Chase, 200K Marriot), is the best bet to hope for some sort of partner airline (i.e. United) to run a sale and be able to book Air Canada via United? Hopefully I'm missing something."
"2018-04-05 06:03:22"|"To F or J on ANA? That is the question... Pics and review of IAH-NRT route"|"Bit of a backstory here: I never really intended to fly ANA F, but since I was prepping to close my Citi Premier card, I had to dump my TYP somewhere. As fortune would have it there was a 25% transfer bonus from Citi -> VS at the time and it left me with enough points to book F when normally I?d have just booked J. So I figured why not let?s compare the 2 cabins. This turned out to be a good thing since I wound up having to change the dates of the trip in January and when I went to rebook it only about 60 days in advance, there was zero J in sight on my route, limited F, but it was there for peak cherry blossom season.

All pictures and viewpoints are from the 777-300 and the IAH-NRT route. All window seats since I was traveling solo.

Here is the IMGUR album link, so follow along, I?ve posted the pics in the same order as the text. It would be a lot more user friendly if reddit would allow in line posting of images, but what can you do? Unless otherwise noted, F pics are on the left, J pics are on the right.

https://imgur.com/a/RvPu6


**Check in and departure at Houston** (no pics)

Sorry to combine this, but they?re the same in either class. While there is 1 dedicated F and 2 J check in counters, all were occupied when I arrived. Either way the wait was minimal and handled quickly, much like last year. ANA uses the United Club as their lounge which is unfortunate for many reasons, mainly because it isn?t very good. Until the IAH Polaris Lounge is ready, the Centurion Lounge remains the best lounge at IAH if you have a qualifying Amex card. I went to the UC to check it out since I had the time, but quickly left. The breakfast spread was weak and the lounge crowded. The CL has infinitely better food and better drinks. Not to mention it?s closer to gate D5, which is the one ANA uses at IAH. Even once the Polaris Lounge opens, I wouldn?t expect there to be any difference for ANA F vs. J since United is phasing out their own F cabin and Global First lounges.

**Check in and departure at Tokyo** (no pics)

The differences here are that F pax are allowed to use the Suites check in which is under the Z letter at NRT Terminal A. Biz pax have their own dedicated lanes in the normal area. F pax have a dedicated security checkpoint (I was the only person in it), while Biz have access to the Gold Track lane. Neither class has access to a dedicated immigration checkpoint, which IMO would have been more useful than a dedicated security checkpoint.

With an F BP, you get to use the ANA Suites lounge vs the biz class side. They are two sides to the same general area (walk in and take a left to go to biz, take a right to go to suites), the main differences being the Suites lounge is far less crowded and has a self serve buffet of hot food, which the biz doesn?t. One review of the Suites lounge I found online said it would be ?a fantastic business class lounge? which is a pretty fair summary since it lacks many of the traits of other top tier lounges, like table service for meals, spa amenities, etc. that you?d find in CX, EK lounges. Hell even AA now has table service Flagship First dining in LAX and JFK. (There are some pictures of the ANA Suites lounge below in the ANA vs JAL comparison I link to)

**The seat**

So first vs biz has long been summed up as seat and service are the real differences. So let?s address the seat. My thoughts: it?s very comfortable, it?s cloth, and while it?s wide, it isn?t anywhere near a crazy width (ala Cathay F), and the seat width is cannibalized by the 5ish inch arm rests on both sides of the seat. See the pic where I used Amex cards for a comparison! Now I?m not a big guy so I don?t terribly care, I fit just fine, I mention it because it got some discussion in the recent ANA J vs F comparison. I didn?t notice much of a difference in seat position vs J in width, but I did in comfort. The ANA F seat is like that comfy recliner you?d had for years, which kind of makes sense, this recliner has been flying around for about 5-6 years. Now this compares with Cathay F, which on the 777 has an absurd seat/bed width. But they also only do 3 across on their 777 in F. 

It?s worth mentioning that getting in and out of the F seat is easier because your pathway is about twice as wide as J.

**The bed**

This probably the biggest hard product advantages of F. As you can see the bed goes fully flat and the bed goes flush with the armrests which take up lot of the space in seated position. Also the footwell is much larger. The ANA I don?t really recall any difference in the quality of the sleep between J and F. As is usual with Asian airlines they kept the temperature a bit warmer than I?d prefer so I barely used the blanket and just had the pyjamas on. The PJs are also way better in F vs the ones I was given in J last year. They?re a lot more comfortable and fit better.

**Dining**

I?m not going to talk too much about this ? you can see the pictures. As the prior ANA comparison mentioned, there isn?t much of a difference between F and J as far as the menu goes, besides an extra appetizer course. The main difference is in the alcohol quality, Krug and Hibiki 21 in F, something lesser and Hibiki 17 in J. ANA?s catering is excellent in both cabins and I haven?t had anything disappointing in my 4 flights with them. Both cabins more or less share the same order on demand snack menu. 

You can view the menu for my flight, and any other ANA flight here: https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/serviceinfo/international/inflight/guide/f/meal/ scroll down and pick your departure city.

**Random musings**

IFE ? I felt that the IFE selections were kind of lacking for US/western tastes. Unless you like Star Wars, they had a shit ton of those movies available. 

Service ? I can?t say I?ve had a negative interaction with any ANA employee yet. They take great care of you, and at least appear to really enjoy their jobs! Their attention to detail is amazing though. On my return flight, one of the FAs who wasn?t the one who served me dinner, was wondering around with a different bottle of red wine from what I originally had. She already knew it wasn?t the one I had ordered, and encouraged me to try a glass of the other red. Part of me wondered if they somehow knew I liked to compare beverages since I had asked for a Hibiki 21 vs 17 comparison on the outbound flight. Also each time you ring the call button, they appear out from behind the curtains in only a few seconds. 


**Overall conclusions**

As far as booking, I can really only recommend F > J as long as the VS award chart lasts, and personally I think it?s ripe for getting ?enhanced? away. I don?t think there?s a single better value out there for true international first class, and when you think that Citi and Amex occasionally have transfer bonuses to further reduce the cost, I just think it?s too good to last. If you intend to take advantage I?d plan to do it sooner rather than later. The cost differential using United miles (220k r/t in F vs 160k in J) or ANA?s program (150k r/t F vs 75-90k J) is way too big to be worthwhile. Personally I?m not even sure I?d book F instead of J via VS unless there was a transfer bonus that allowed you to basically pay for J and get F. 

So where do these products rank for me? While ANA has an undoubtedly solid F product, it?s not the best I?ve flown. The ground service and lounge amenities are somewhat lacking, the hard product is a bit dated, I think this F cabin is unchanged since it came out at least 5-6 years ago. A friend flew ANA F from Japan to NYC from this same trip, he hadn?t flown it since 2013, and said nothing?s changed. Finally, while not an issue for me since I?m forever single, it?s not an ideal product for couples. What it makes up for is trademark fantastic Japanese service and excellent crew, very good food and booze, and a comfy seat and bed.

Personally I don?t think there would be anywhere as much hype about ANA F if it weren?t for the really good value of booking through VS, and the fact that Japan is an awesome place to visit. I?m not trying to belittle ANA F, it?s just that I think the largest failing ANA F is only incrementally better than J. The meals are mostly the same, both cabins have all aisle 1-2-1 access, and the ground experience is almost the same. 

Emirates still takes the #1 spot for me, Cathay follows at #2, and ANA now at #3. But let?s talk J products. ANA is 1st in my long-haul J ranking, followed by Virgin Australia in #2, Delta?s A350 in #3, AA at #4, and Thai in a distant #5. 

Up on the travel docket for the rest of the year as far as new products go, assuming no changes, are QF J, TG F, CX J, and JL J, all in one wacky trip. Of those I?m most excited for TG F on the 747 and JL J. 

**Another resource to look at ANA F**

I didn?t write this comparison, but a user on Flyertalk posted this comprehensive comparison of ANA F vs JAL F. I haven?t yet flown JAL F, so I personally can?t attest to the conclusions, but I don?t disagree with any of his opinions about ANA. https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trip-reports/1857800-comparing-jal-ana-first-class-better.html


**NRT vs HND**

I see lots of people online talk up the superiorness of HND because it?s closer. On this trip I finally had a chance to use HND for a domestic flight (ANA Y, which I haven?t covered here, if you have any questions feel free to ask away).

Fun fact about domestic flights in Japan, there are no liquids restrictions, so you can carry your water bottle through security. Beer would probably be cool too, given Japan?s lack of laws prohibiting open containers of alcohol. 

Ok yeah it?s closer to downtown, but damn does the monorail get crowded around rush hour time, and you?re still probably going to need to transfer from the monorail or the Keisei line to another subway or JR line to get your destination. I still like the NEX train because you?re guaranteed a seat, which isn?t necessarily true on either transit line to HND, there is free and fairly fast WIFI, and if you are staying in the main areas of Tokyo like Shinjuku or around Tokyo Station, you don?t have to transfer lines.

However, I was giving my wife a vacation as a gift and challenged myself to get all the flights with miles... in either J or F.  If you go back in my post history a little over a year ago, you see me asking questions in the megathreads about redemptions.  They gradually shape into my final itinerary as I learn about certain routes and their availabilities.  Around 330 days before my trip, here is what I purchased (all dollar amounts are USD):

    Itinerary #1

    (bought with AS miles)

Free stopover in Fiji thanks to Alaska Airline's award ticket rules!  Woo!  We happily spent 9 days in the Yasawa Islands in a village homestay.  The village we stayed in fed us everyday (each meal with a different family!) and we got to work alongside many of them throughout our time there (scraping coconuts, fishing, going to school).  Very, very awesome stopover.  [Picture of our hut](http://i.imgur.com/WapFamP.jpg)

We then did a week in New Zealand.  In retrospect, I wish I had done a week in Fiji and 9 days in NZ.  Still, we rented a car and had a total blast.  Glow worm caves, Hobbits, thermal pools... the whole time was intensely amazing.  [Picture of our rental car and one of the lookouts we stopped at](http://i.imgur.com/WrPj4o6.jpg)

    Itinerary #2
    Dep       Arr       Date      Class     Airline   Miles     Taxes
    AKL       BNE       May 07    J         QF        17.5k/pp  $61.30/pp
    BNE       CNS       May 08    J         QF
    (bought with AA miles)

This kind of sucked.  :(  Originally, we had a AKL-SYD-CNS flight booked for May 06 but QF cancelled the AKL leg about 3 months before departure.  As soon as I got the notification, I scrambled to find a replacement (all outbound QF AKL flights on May 06 were cancelled for some reason) for the next day to get to CNS.  Plenty of flights got us halfway there but they were all later in the day, forcing us to take an overnight stopover in BNE.  It wasn't the biggest deal but it did eat one of our vacation days.

Once we got to CNS, we hopped aboard a liveaboard yacht and scuba dived the Great Barrier Reef for 4 days!  The amount of wildlife was insane!  Like, imagine thousands of fish swimming around in a tightly packed school...  I got to swim in that!  Giant clams, sharks, manta rays, sea turtles, fish, fish and more fish.  There were so many different kinds of fish.  The weirdest thing was how much the fish either didn't care I was there or how keenly curious about my presence.  There were some potato cod (100kg fish) that followed me around and would occasionally bump into me, as well as schools of travelli (50kg fish) that would swarm around me.  Surreal.

    Itinerary #3
    Dep       Arr       Date      Class     Airline   Miles     Taxes
    CNS       MEL       May 12    J         QF        17.5k/pp  $21.70/pp
    MEL       LST       May 12    Y         QF
    (bought with AA miles)

We had a couple hour layover in MEL, so we went to the QF lounge.  The grumpiest lady was working the front desk.  I wasn't sure if we got access with our tickets, since we depart on a Y ticket (single cabin flight).  The lady (her name is Mel, if you visit this lounge frequently) wouldn't even let me finish my question!  I thought there might be some exception as I bought the itinerary in business, there just was no business class on our outbound flight.  She cut me off 3 times, telling me we don't get access because the outbound ticket isn't business (never letting me tell her about my itinerary).  Fine, you want to play that game?  I abruptly stopped talking and stared at her as I pulled out my wallet and gently placed my AA Admiral's Club membership on the desk and slid it towards her. She begrudgingly let us in.  It was our only bad experience in the whole trip.

We rented a car again while we were in Tasmania and man, this state is absolutely beautiful.  Most of Australia is a desert but Tassie is lush and green and full of wildlife.  Just like in NZ, we had an grand time.  Wineries, creameries, wildlife sanctuaries, hiking, kayaking.  We saw a platypus in the wild!  We even got to pet a wombat at the wildlife rehabilitation center!!  The weather didn't really cooperate on this part of the trip, as it rained nearly everyday.  Luckily, the rain goes in 10-15 minute spurts and we got plenty of time in the wilderness.

    (bought with AS miles)

My wife and I mostly backpack, stay in hostels or stay with airbnb when travelling through countries.  We are not fancy people.  However, giving her the ability to travel in comfort was important for me, which is why we flew in J or F (her first time in J/F!).  That being said, I wanted to give her at least one night in a really fancy hotel.  So, I used one of my free Hyatt nights for the Park Hyatt Sydney.

Earlier that day, we went to Bonorong (about 30 min from HBA) and saw a bunch of animals.  This includes a big field with over 100 kangaroos.  I didn't realize until we got there that we were actually in the field with the kangaroos... and they give you some food to feed them.  My wife and I were swarmed (in the cutest way) by these forest kangaroos.  It was a ton of fun to feed and pet them!  However, we kind of lost track of time and by the end of it we were covered in mud and kangaroo poop.  We then had to go straight to the airport so we didn't miss the flight and the HBA QF lounge it too small to have showers.

So not only did we fly J in our backpacking outfits covered in kangaroo poop, we also took the train into Sydney and walked to the Park Hyatt Sydney.  We were sweaty, stinky and covered in poo when we walked up to the front door.  I give the front concierge props because he didn't miss a beat and quickly took our bags and helped us check in.  The front desk lady escorted us to our room and the bellhop quickly followed with our bags.  Thanks to my Hyatt status, our room was upgraded and we got a fantastic view of the harbor and the Sydney Opera House.  My wife was super overwhelmed with the hotel because it was so nice.  On the very same vacation we stayed in jungle bures that didn't even have a floor... and now we are in a fantastic 5 star hotel!  We washed off the poo, walked around the city for a couple hours before a late dinner and finally bed.

Our flight home [(in-flight food report)](http://imgur.com/a/PPJ1E).  I was actually in Copenhagen when the 330 day mark hit, so the time difference let me comfortably purchase this ticket while eating breakfast (instead of having to stay up until midnight PST).  I was watching these like crazy the week or two before hand and noticed that no seat was available for more than 5 minutes.  I had to buy fast if I wanted to secure these very, very desired seats.  Fully flat lay down seats on a 14.5 hour flight?  Yes, please.  I felt like UA gave us better hard products (amenities kit, seats, entertainment) but worse customer service.  It wasn't bad... it was just not as good.  FJ flight attendants were the friendliest by far.

My wife really liked having lounge access every time we were at the airport.  The biggest reasons were free coffee (QF lounges have a barista!!  All others had a machine), free wifi and a clean place to pee.  I have had lounge access for quite some time, so I guess I am a bit used to it... but my wife loved it!

So all in all, it cost me 360k miles and $610.60 for 2 people to fly.  Here are the cards I signed up for to achieve this (it doesn't add up because I had some miles from flying that I used as well):

    Total                        320000          $1820         $1593

I also got 2 Global Entry credits, a $200 travel credit, and an AA Admiral's Club membership.  I wouldn't have done the Citi Executive card except I wanted to run an experiment (still running) to see if I can actually get $450 of value out of it.  It is sort of subjective because I don't know what a small plate of veggies is worth but somethings like the beer/spirits are easy to tally.  I enjoy these sorts of things, so it was worth the $450 annual fee (I mean, there were also the 75k miles out of the card...).

If you count the $450 Citi Exec annual fee as a cost of the flight as well as the $25 statement credit gains on the AS cards, the total cost of the flights comes to $837.60.

As far as CPM goes, I was never really that concerned about maximizing it.  I just wanted an awesome vacation (and I got it!).  That being said, I set up a script to pull the cheapest available tickets for a given class over the course of a month (90 days to 60 days prior to departure).  Given these cheapest ticket prices, I calculated my CPM on economy (what I would have paid) and first (just for fun) by taking the total, subtracting the amount paid ($837.60) and then dividing by the number of miles spent (360000):

    Part            Y           J/F
    Itinerary #1    $979.00     $3540.00
    Itinerary #2    $213.00     $504.00
    Itinerary #3    $197.00     $673.00
    Itinerary #4    $91.00      $619.00
    Itinerary #5    $697.00     $1658.00
    CPM             $0.010      $0.037

The hardest part of planning and redeeming this whole trip was finding award availability.  April and May are shoulder tourist seasons, so I had an advantage there.  I wouldn't even attempt this Dec-Mar (peak tourist season) because I doubt you'd find anything available.  I noticed that FJ is particularly bad about this (never releasing award seats for peak tourist seats but releasing literally all seats to award during non-peak season).  It was a ton of work but it was really worth it.  The trip was awesome and I feel way more knowledgeable about international award bookings now.

"2018-11-22 05:03:16"|"2020: Year of Festivals"|"I work for myself and am able to work remotely, so I have a lot of travel flexibility.  I had this crazy idea about traveling in the year 2020 around a  festival/event theme: going to places with some of the more interesting cultural festivals/events around the world.  The tentative schedule I've put together:

&#x200B;

Tuna throwing festival in Port Lincoln, Australia: January 26

Snow festival in Sapporo, Japan: February 3 - 10 (EDIT: now thinking of dropping this in favor of the Olympics in July/August in Tokyo)

Battle of the Oranges in Ivrea, Italy: February 22 - 25

Chiditarod in Chicago, USA: March 7

Calcio Storico in Florence, Italy: semifinals in early June, final is on June 24

Euro 2020 football (soccer) tournament throughout Europe: June 12 to July 12

EDIT: Now looking at adding in the Tokyo Olympics in early August and then the Fringe festival in Edinborough in mid August

La Tomatina in Bunol, Spain: August 26

International Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque, USA: October 3 - 11

Dia de Los Muertos, Mexico City (or Oaxaca), Mexico:  November 2

Cayman Pirates Week, Grand Cayman: mid November

&#x200B;

So I can't just travel the whole year, but there are some distinct trips that I feel like I could build with this agenda.  I'm thinking:

&#x200B;

**Trip 1**

January 19ish: fly to Melbourne and go to the Australian Open.  One of my bucket list items is to attend all 4 tennis grand slams...so far I've done the US and the French.  If I'm going to Australia in January anyway, this seems like a no brainer.  I've been to Australia before but only Sydney and Cairns.

January 25: fly over to Port Lincoln and attend the tuna throwing festival

January 27: Fly to New Zealand.  I've never been and it's high on my list.

February 7ish: Fly to Sapporo and attend the closing couple days of the snow festival.  Maybe I could spend a few more days in Japan...not sure where else I'd go in Winter.  I've been to Tokyo and Kyoto before.  EDIT: Now thinking of dropping this out of the trip and heading straight from New Zealand to Rome.

February 11ish: Fly to Rome, which I've been to before but it's been 20 years.  Head down to southern Italy which I've never been to before.

February 21ish: Head up to Ivrea which is near Turin and attend the Battle of the Oranges.

February 26ish (or maybe I spend a bit more time in Europe): Fly home to Chicago.

March 7th: Attend Chiditarod.

&#x200B;

**Trip 2**

Mid May: Fly to Europe.  Hit up some places I'd like to go: Switzerland (never been), Paris (would love to go back to the French Open), Venice (never been).  Then go to the Calcio Storico in Florence for the semifinals in early-ish June (dates TBA).  Then on to a group stage Euros match

Mid June: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

**Trip 3**

EDIT: Now thinking of flying to Tokyo in early August for the Olympics then heading to Edinborough for the Fringe Festival before proceeding on to Spain.

August 23ish: Fly to Spain.  Work my way over to Bunol for La Tomatina on the 26th.  Then head North and potentially explore non-Paris France (never been), Belgium (never been), the Netherlands (I've been to Amsterdam 20 years ago).

Late September: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

The rest of the events at the end of the year are straightforward flights in/out within North America/Caribbean.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking that I will want to use miles for:

USA to Australia (business)

New Zealand to Japan (business)

Japan to Italy (business)

Italy to USA (economy)

USA to Europe in May (business)

Europe to USA in June (economy)

USA to Europe in August (business)

Europe to USA in September (economy)

&#x200B;

Everything else I think I could just pay cash.

&#x200B;

So of course all these dates are too far out to check for award availability.  But I'd like to talk through my options and what is likely to be available to see if I can pull this off or if I need to make adjustments.  Here's my miles/points stash:

Amex: 95K

Merrill Lynch: 28K

Alaska: 137K (will soon get add'l 40K bonus)

American Airlines: 124K

BA: 6.5K

Delta: 35K

Southwest: 36K

United: 43K (though I suspect I'll need to use 30K for travel in May 2019)

Choice: 8K

Hilton: 47K

Hyatt: 57K

IHG: 20K

Radisson: 119K

Wyndham: 20K

&#x200B;

I've done a little bit of proof of concept award travel search seeing if I could find the awards I need if I was doing this trip in 2019 instead of 2020.  I had success with everything except how to get to Australia with business class.  Of course I am searching just a month and a half out for Australia so that may be why there's no availability.  Here was my tentative plan for paying for this stuff with points.

&#x200B;

USA to Australia (business): I'm not sure how to crack this one because business class award availability to Australia is so tough.  Using Alaska miles to fly Cathay through Hong Kong seems like the most likely option?  If I ended up having a stopover for a couple of days in Hong Kong that would be totally cool as I've never been there before.  I really don't know if availability will be there for January 2020 if I start searching in February 2020.  Unfortunately, this is when I am least flexible in terms of timing: January is my busiest work time of year.  I'm going to work like the dickens the first 2 weeks of January 2020 to put as much to bed as possible but I really can't leave the USA in those first 2 weeks.

New Zealand to Japan (business): Looks like I can do this for just 40K AA miles.  There's availability for this in 2019 on Malaysian Air so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Japan to Italy (business): Can do this for 75K AA miles. There's availability for this in 2019 on BA so I'd hope there'd be availability in 2020.  I was worried the YQ surcharges would be really bad but it's only $200.

Italy to USA (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in May (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in June (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in August (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in September (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

&#x200B;

So I need 95K more Amex points but I figure I can find a way to make that happen.

&#x200B;

**My Questions**

1. Are there any great festivals I'm missing?  I considered Carnivale in Brazil or Mardi Gras in New Orleans, but I'm really just not sure the former is for me, and in any case this Battle of the Oranges seemed too cool to miss.  Though maybe I'm doubling up on that sort of thing if I'm going to La Tomatina.  I've been to Oktoberfest or that would be on the list for sure.  I suppose I could still go back during my Aug/Sep Europe trip.
2. Is there a better way to spend award points to make this trip come together?  Or credit cards I can get to get some points I need to do this better?  I'm way over 5/24.
3. Getting to Australia especially: I'm really concerned that I won't find availability on Cathay with Alaska miles in the tight window I will be looking and then I'm screwed.  Ideas?

&#x200B;

I appreciate everybody's help and sorry for such a long post.

"2017-02-19 23:36:13"|"Getting a family of 8 to Hawaii on miles aka Wasting a day of my life with Singapore Airlines."|"So over the years I've bugged my Dad into signing up for credit card bonuses. Usually talk him into 1-2 a year. He's done several Chase cards : CSP, Ink+, and CSR (damn you 5/24!) and amassed ~300k UR. Somehow my family decided that they should vacation in Hawaii  this year and so I get a call last weekend from my Mom that she wants to use the points to get everyone to Hawaii. I with a 2M+ points balance offered to get myself there (and on a different plane in first class hopefully...), this left me trying to find 7 RT seats from the east coast for 300k UR points. Didn't have the heart to tell Mom there is a high chance this won't be possible. It's great being your family's travel agent... 

Let the search begin. Nothing at all on AA, same for DL. Somehow, unbelievably, I found 7 UA saver seats on the same flights and they were actually pretty good flights. Non-stop there and sensible layover coming back. The dates even worked for everyone involved!

OK, now how to book these? UA RT saver is 45k to HI, so 7x45k=315k=too many points. But hold on, Singapore Airlines (SQ) is only 35k points and is also a Chase transfer option. 7x35k=245k=I might actually pull this off. To purchase the flights was ~$1,000 a flight, so $7000/245000=$0.028/point, not bad. 

Call up Dad and tell him he needs to get a Singapore Airlines Krisflyer account. He seemed very skeptical about my plans to ""ship my valuable points to Singapore? Where is that?"", nevertheless he does as told and the next day I walk him patiently over the phone how to combine all his points onto the CSR and then transfer 245k to SQ. This is not instant, so now the wait begins with several checks to make sure those 7 seats haven't disappeared.

Next day after work, check his SQ account and the points are there. Let the fun begin.

Call up SQ and say I would like to book 7 seats to Hawaii. The lady informs me that this is not possible. To redeem for someone other than yourself on SQ that person needs to be on your ""Redemption Nominee List"" and that list can only contain 5 persons, so including yourself only 6 persons is possible. Arrghh! OK, I would still consider 6 persons a win, will find another way for #7.

Hang up and log into the SQ account and start putting the names into the online form. Once that is done, called SQ back. Told the agent I would like to book myself (my Dad) and everyone on my ""Redemption Nominee List"" to Hawaii. Could hear right in her voice that she didn't think this would be possible. Spoon fed the flights and to her surprise there was actually availability.  Let's book it! She starts the process then says ""oooh I think there is a problem. In your Redemption Nominee List I see Sally Smith, Smiley Smith, and then Smith Becky. I think you reversed one of the names. No way we can book this"". Arrrggghhh! Sure enough I did mess up one name. 

OK, how do we fix this? Well, you must fill out the ""Redemption Nominee Form"" to make the correction. But you cannot do this online anymore. This can only be done BY SENDING A FAX TO SINGAPORE! AAaaarrgghhh! Pleaded with the agent to put the flights on hold, which thankfully she did, but can only hold for 3 days. It's late so let's try again tomorrow. 

Call up my Dad the next day and tell him to forward the email from SQ. Get the PDF to fill out, but it is not form fillable, of course. Figure out the right program to edit the PDF, add a John Hancock, then went searching the web to figure out how to send a fax to Singapore online. Luckily, HelloFax will let you send 3 free pages of fax to anywhere in the world with a Microsoft account. Fax done!

Next day, ask Dad to check for any emails, get forwarded a nice note from Krisflyer that one of the names doesn't seem right. In the original ""Redemption Nominee Form"" the name was spelled Becky Smith, but in the new faxed ""Redemption Nominee Form"" it was spelled Beckey Smith. ArrghhhhhhhHH! I shouldn't fill out forms late at night and should know how to spell my niece's names. It shouldn't matter since Becky is 8 years old and flying without ID solely within the US. Call up Krisflyer as it's now 10am in Singapore and after much holding and discussion they agree to use the correct name. Should be fixed by by tomorrow. 

OK, next day comes around. After work with <24 hours to get this ticketed I call back SQ. Tell the lady I would like to ticket these. She starts at it then says ""oooh there is a problem. You never paid to change your Redemption Nominee List. That will require US$50"". Pushed back lightly that I didn't ""change"" but only corrected my ""Redemption Nominee List"". She said I should have done this online as it was only US$20. I wanted to scream ""YOU CAN'T DO IT ONLINE THAT IS WHY I HAD TO SEND A F'ING FAX TO SINGAPORE"", but instead I just gave them the credit card details to charge the $50. Was informed she would need to verify this all with Krisflyer and call me back...

Couple of hours later, well after midnight, get a call from Singapore. Let's book this! Had the agent read back the flights on hold, they missed one of the segments on the return... All the availability was still there (thank god) so after some time correcting all the flights we go to book. ""oooh there is a problem. Several of the persons on your Redemption Nominee List have Passport/ID numbers with all zeroes. There is no way I can book this with that"" AAARGHRghghghghggrtllll!! Keep calm, keep calm. I try explain that these persons were young children travelling solely within the United States and therefore did not require an ID or passport. She was having none of this and kept insisting I would need to file a new ""Redemption Nominee Form"" to correct the Passport/ID numbers. She suggested I do it online this time as its only $20. It took every bit of my strength to not scream ""YOU CAN'T F'ING DO IT ONLINE ONLY BY F'ING FAX"", instead I calmly asked to speak with a supervisor. At 2:30am after being on this call for well over an hour she comes back on and says her supervisor found a way to make this work. Minutes later tickets all booked. They even forgot to deduct miles for one of the segments, so there are 52k points still in the SQ account. Finally, Success!

But, there is still person #7 without a ticket. Log onto united.com, find the flights, enter the details and payment, confirmation received. All done in under 2 minutes...

My fiancee and I are looking to go to Japan for our honeymoon and plan on cashing in our United & UR points to do ANA 1st class one way, business class the other (not enough MPs or other points to do another airline). Though the ANA product is pretty isolating, we still want to sit next to each other on the planes. I hold the majority of the points, so we were thinking a have me book the 2 first class and 1 business class, then he books the other business class. Then, once we get our info from United for the ANA flight, we try to select seats with them. Will that work, or is there something else we need to do?

Spent like 5 hours today trying to understand different stopover/open jaw policies and trying to figure out different regions, and having a lot of trouble and would prefer help. If you have the best route set up for us, I am willing to give you 3 months of gold :)



**Basic details:**


Departure city is either SFO or OAK.


**3 Destinations:**

Japan, Tokyo or Kyoto (10 days)

Seoul (3 days)

Maldives 10 days (OR Bangkok/Ko Phi Phi, but Maldives is significantly more preferred)


Japan and Seoul can be flipped, but would like last destination to be Maldives (or Thailand). We prefer it to be Maldives, but if you cannot make it work, then Thailand would be the alternative.


**Dates:**


Departing July 1st from SFO or OAK.
Departing Final City (maldives or thailand) for arrival ON July 24.


**Points available:**


**Me:**

* United: 20,000 (Gold member, so wider availability of awards)
* Delta: 40,000
* American: 150,000
* SPG: 73,000
* Chase UR: 235,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* AMEX MR: 145,000  (transferable to a lot of airlines)


**Wife:**

* United: 12,000
* American: 64,000
* SPG: 40,000
* Chase UR: 28,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* CapitalOne: 15,600
* Amex MR: 103,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)


How can we make this work? Could really use some guidance. 

Ideal parameters: maximize stopover rules, saver awards ONLY preferred (but if no availability, might have to suck it up), would prefer business class for Departing flight from SFO/OAK.

**United**:

- IAH is a United hub.

- Neat Exclusion Perk

**Alaska**:

- 120K AS miles after conversion

- Stopovers are allowed on one-way awards, meaning you could stop in Hong Kong enroute to somewhere else in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, India, or the Middle East.

- Alaska charges no fees to change or cancel a ticket up until 60 days before departure, so you can lock in a speculative booking now, and then cancel it until close to the travel date

- Cheap Cathay Pacific F redemptions

**Goals:**

- Make the miles last as long as possible

- Fly Biz/F one-way at least once to South America (Peru), Middle East (Turkey, Egypt, Oman, Dubai), and/or SE Asia (Indonesia, Phillipines, Vietnam, Singapore).

**Booking The Trip**

My wife and I were invited to a friend's wedding in Bangkok this past fall - we quickly realized that if we were going to go, we had better make the most of our time there!  My primary goal was to get us there and back in international J, preferably Asia-based carriers, and to have free hotels while in the larger cities.  I managed to accomplish that with the points I had without much trouble, and it made for such an amazing time.  I knew going in that getting good value for points in smaller locations was tougher, and I paid cash wherever I didn't see our point value being realized.

For flights: I found space on Cathay in J flying from EWR to HKG direct without much trouble - searching via British Airway's site for availability, and calling into American was very simple.  Easy as pie to put it on hold as my wife and I finalized getting our vacation days approved and aligned.  

I booked the return flights about a month afterwards - in my research, the best returns from HAN seemed to be Star Alliance carriers, so I got a United Explorer card for a quick 50k United points to combine with my UR points.   I'd read so many good things about EVA, so they were my first priority. Finding the right flight on EVA was difficult, as there was nearly no availability on our dates, but I ended up getting lucky with space for 2 opening up for HAN-TPE-JFK.  My other choice was going to be Asiana, which had loads of availability on most days.

For hotels: I had more than a few stays at Hilton in the last year, which combined with the Aspire giving me Diamond status, netted me a boatload of points.  Booking the Conrad and Waldorf was simple and straight forward.  Hilton's website makes it incredibly easy, and the ""points & cash"" slider is a great feature.

For the other hotels and intra-Asia flights the points options were either not very attractive, points weren't an option, or the cash value was so low that using points would have been a waste.  Think something along the lines of 40k IHG points a night for $110 room.  Another example - a domestic flight on Thai Airways in J for two people for $200 total or 55k United miles.

In essence, we used a lot of points at the very beginning of the trip, then a large gap of no points, then lots of points at the end.

**Taking The Trip**

We took that late evening flight from EWR, which meant a 1:50am departure, landing in HKG at 5:30am.  The wife and I had a long day leading up to the flight with work and frantic packing, so right after the meal service finished I passed out for 10 hours straight, waking up with about 1.5 hours to landing.  Can't complain about a good night's rest, and we landed an hour early at 4:30.

After landing and the most casual immigration procedure I'd ever experienced (guy just looks at my passport and waves me through), we headed to The Arrival until our driver arrived.  Most people online complained about The Arrival, saying it was small and got crowded easily, but after I got solid breakfast and a shower any pre-conceived notions dripped away. Great place to start the day.

I had pre-booked a Blacklane airport transfer, which made getting into the city immensely helpful - we ended up getting our transfer to the Conrad in a Tesla Model S, which was loads of fun.  The Conrad was just beautiful.  The upgraded room with harbor views was awesome to wake up to every morning, and the executive lounge breakfast spread was enormous.  We spent 4 days/3 nights in Hong Kong, doing walking tours all over and eating until our engorged stomachs plead for mercy.  Highlights were the Peak, Cafe 103, old-school dim-sum, Seventh Son, [Bird Market and Flower Market](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bird+Market/@22.3247495,114.174486,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa0bc7e979fe4671a!8m2!3d22.3258908!4d114.1738208) at night, Temple Street night market, and loads of small wonton restaurants. Highly recommend using [Little Adventures in Hong Kong](https://www.littleadventuresinhongkong.com/) for any walking tours - wonderful way to get introduced to a new place.

Our flights to Chiang Mai were on Air Asia, which was a step down in quality from international J on Cathay, but got us from point A to point B in 2.5 hours without any fuss and for a good price.  We used Klook for our airport transfer in Chiang Mai, which was less formal than Blacklane, but still very nice to not have to worry about how you're going to get to the hotel after a flight.  We stayed on the outskirts of Chiang Mai at the Four Seasons, which was one of the most heavenly hotels I've ever been too.  Our upgraded pool villa had it's own 15-meter long infinity pool, private entrance, indoor/outdoor showers, and complete peace/seclusion away from the rest of the rooms in the hotel.  We could have sat on the back porch for hours and hours, but Chiang Mai beckoned.  

That first night, we began the tailoring process (I wasn't going to bring a suit with me!) for a couple of things at [His and Hers Tailors](https://www.google.com/maps/place/His+%26+Her+Tailors+House/@18.7760818,98.9992473,19.23z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x30da3aa7b0e9dded:0xcbb2f60be5fb644d!8m2!3d18.7762722!4d98.9991653).  Mr. Win took care of everything, and worked with our schedule to have several suits and jackets made up in a few days.  Such a great place.  Chiang Mai was a cavalcade of senses and noises, not unlike going to Mumbai or Dar es Salaam, but much much cleaner.  There was very little trash anywhere, and people here were clearly proud of their city.  Tuk-tuk drivers were friendly and helpful without being scammy, and the food was just awesome.  I ate as much street eats as I could take.  One of our days was dedicated to an Elephant Rehab center - I did a LOT of research, trying to find an actually ethical one, and [Patara Elephant Farm](https://www.pataraelephantfarm.com/) stood out.  

Our other days in Chiang Mai were a mix of massages, Wat (temple) sightseeing, streetfood, and painting hunting.  There were a lot of VERY talented painters, and we ended up finding a beautiful pond/koi scene that's now hanging in our front hall!

We had 4 days in Chiang Mai, then needed to get down to Bangkok for the wedding!  I found domestic J tickets on Thai Airways for $200 one-way on a 777-200, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it out!  Service was wonderful, the seats were comfy, and they managed to get in a full meal with separate dessert on a 1.5 hour flight.  I also got a kick out of monks ""cutting"" the line - there were a few signs posted around for this: monks get to go, out of respect, to the front of the line at check-in and security, and also board first.  We had monks on all of our Thailand and Cambodia flights.

We were picked up by another Blacklane in Bangkok, and taken to the Waldorf Astoria.  This hotel is still pretty new, and it showed.  Everything GLEAMED.  It actually hurt to stare at the hotel if you were walking up to it on a sunny day.  The rooms were high-tech; windows, lights, TV, AC, lamps, bathroom fan, etc. was controllable from an ipad next to the bed.  Was fun to wake up, hit a button, and watch the room be bathed in early morning Bangkok light.  Over the three days we were in Bangkok, we spent a good deal of time with the wedding party and the activities around that, but one whole day was dedicated to just my wife and I doing a tour.  Could not recommend [Smiling Albino Tours](https://www.smilingalbino.com/) for private tours enough.  Our guide took care of EVERYTHING for the day, made sure we weren't overheating (was 92+ degrees with like 1000% humidity), gave great history lessons/background to what we were looking at, and was funny to boot.  8 hours whizzed by in a happy blur while walking and riverboating along the canals and klongs.

After the wedding, we had a hungover, dehydrated, and verrrrryyy early flight to Siem Reap in Cambodia - home of Angkor Wat.  However, my hangover was washed away by the ride our hotel was picking us up in.  [Virtoth's Hotel](http://viroth-hotel.com/) sent (for only $30 extra) a 1960's Rolls-Royce to pick us up!  What an experience! It was about 300 feet long, and must have weighed more than all the elephants in Cambodia put together, judging by the noise the suspension made going over bumps.  I had to yell across a chasm of space to have the driver hear us. He may have been seated in a different zip code.  

The highlight, of course, when one goes to Siem Reap is the Angkor Wat temple complex.  Our guide from [Angkor Special Tours](https://angkorspecialtours.com/) on the first day took us to Angkor Wat first, in the afternoon, but from the rear entrance - he didn't want us to see it from the front until we got a chance to at sunrise the next morning.  Having a personal guide (you're probably noticing a theme here) makes all the difference, IMO, in enjoying something.  After Angkor Wat was Angkor Thom, and then about 3 more temples whose name is now escaping me.  ""Temple-itis"" is definitely real, but if you're a history buff, and your guide is willing to explain everything to you, then you'll never stop smiling.

The next morning, we did the quintessential ""sunrise at Angkor Wat"" thing, which was fun, but very crowded.  Glad I did it, but don't need to go back.  The BIG highlight for me, however, was being the first person into [Ta Prohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Prohm).  Our guide managed to get us in a few minutes early, and we had the whole temple to ourselves.  It truly is a magical, wonderful, ethereal place.  Beautiful grey silk cotton trees strangle the rock and edifices and massive roots cascade, web-like, off roofs to form walls of intricately mangled wood.  We got about 30 minutes here to ourselves and it was out of this world cool.

That evening, we flew to Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines on a 737 with about 15 people on it. Fun. It was hellish to get through immigration, and hell again finding our driver, and then hell a third time watching him text, email, call, and drive simultaneously at 100 kph.  Hanoi might have Mumbai beat for insane traffic.  I ran out of fingers and toes to count the near-death experiences.  A quick night's stay at the La Siesta Trendy, and we were picked up the next day at 7am by our driver to head to Ha Long Bay!  It's a four hour drive to Ha Long, so bring a book or stare out the window at endless rice paddies.  

I had booked us onto the [L'Amour Junk](https://www.indochina-junk.com/lamour-junk/) for one night.  This may have been the highlight of the trip for us.  We had been going at a quick pace for almost 2 weeks straight at this point (5 cities in 14 days), but hadn't realized it until we relaxed on the lounge chairs, watching limestone islets and crags slowly pass by.  Our boat was private - just the crew and us - so it enabled us to skip all of the ""touristy"" items that all the boat companies in Ha Long bring you to - we simply asked the captain if we could keep cruising instead of doing a cave tour or whatever and he said ""No problem, it's your boat"" (or something to that effect in Vietnamese).  Even at a leisurely 5kph, the grandeur of Ha Long and Bai Tu Long Bay cannot be ignored.  It feels primordial - like you've been transported back to an earlier version of yourself, millions of years ago.  Our meals on the boat were to die for - fresh seafood and local veggies, and after a bottle or two of good wine sleep came easily and quickly.  Slowly waking up on the boat on the water was a great experience, and stepping back on land was bittersweet - we wished we had more time to spend on the bay.

After getting back to Hanoi, our last day and a half was spent exploring cafes, bun cha joints, and attempting not to die while crossing the street.  The flights back to JFK from HAN were a great way to end our trip - we loved the Song Hong lounge with its enormous windows and great runway views, the Infinity Lounge in TPE had amazing showers and tasty food options, and the piece de resistance: EVA in J from TPE to JFK direct.   I'm not going to be upset about a comfy seat, Krug 2004, delicious food, and Kavalan Whisky.  Flight attendants went above and beyond - after I had finished my dinner, I grabbed my pajamas and went to the bathroom to get changed.  in the 5 minutes I was gone, my entire bed was made up for sleeping, my slippers were placed neatly, and my spare shirt was taken to be hung.  Haven't had that in any other international J product.  We actually made the mistake of sleeping *too much on the flight back - my wife and I slept about 8 hours each.  We took off at 9pm, and landed at 10pm the same day, so we in essence had a full nights' rest then landed at bedtime.  It was two weeks before I wasn't waking up at 4am everyday.

My wife and I absolutely had the best time on this trip, and I cannot emphasize enough how fun, tasty, and enjoyable SE Asia can be.  "

I am a college student from New Jersey. Over the past few years, I have done a lot of travel. In a year alone, I had two trips to Houston and a trip to Guatemala while I was in high school. As my travels might continue to continue, I am noticing the need to sign up for a rewards program that will work around me.

My most frequently used airport is EWR. It's very close to home and fits most of my needs. My most frequently used airline however... I dunno.

Most of the time, we attempt to fly United. My father flew Continental for ages and now tries his best to fly United as they both merged.. Only once in a while will he fly another airline, usually because of the cost. I had a similar situation as some of these trips were paid for by organizations. When I was invited to Houston and Alabama for three competitions, I flew twice on Southwest to Houston and once on American to Alabama.

I also plan on moving south to Maryland which has hubs for both Southwest and United. Nonetheless, I am still unsure how good of a frequent mile program United is and if its even worth considering, however with my more recent travel, I might end up trying it out.

Any thoughts?"

So, the deal is I have around 150K in Marriott points, so I need another 120k of Marriott points.  I have around 400k Amex MR. I was thinking to transfer 120K of Amex MR over to SPG, which would give me a total 270K in Marriott points, so I can then purchase a package with Alaska or United or Southwest miles, so I get 120k miles....basically transfering Amex MR to any airline at this point is 1:1. I also get a cat 1-5 7 night.

Any thoughts on if this is a good idea or not? 

I am thinking good idea, but really going back and forth if it is or not? We travel 4-5 times a year, domestic and international. 2 Companion passes with SW.

Anyhow, I'll be booking some upcoming paid fares for work soon and trying to figure out how to get the best value from one of these programs.  I know Delta offers Comfort + upgrades to Starwood Plat members, but those are often middle seats it sounds like.  I'm not sure what else may tip the scales in either direction.

"2017-12-08 23:38:31"|"Hawaii Trip"|"I know there are a lot of posts about Hawaii...so here?s another one!

My fianc? and I are getting married in April 2018. We're planning a delayed honeymoon - probably August - October timeframe. Our leading candidate for destination is Hawaii. I've spent the past few days researching all the different ways to get there with points. I have the following points: 260k UR, 130k MR, 40k United, 120k SW, 70k JetBlue, 140k Hilton, 130k Marriott, 80k SPG.

I realize that the cheapest way to get there with points is probably transferring to Korean Air. However, I think I want to book the tickets before we're actually married and I know they have restrictions on that. I know there are a few other cheap options (Air France, British Airways, etc.) but I would really like to fly at least one way in first class. It seems like the best first class going to Hawaii is on Hawaiian Airlines. If we're not flying first class, I would at least like a plane with 2-X-2 seating. I believe that leaves either a 767 or A330. All of Hawaiian's flights appear to be on an A330 with 2-4-2 seating. The only reasonable option I see for a 767 is Delta metal booked through Air France but the availability is a pretty iffy. Also, I'm thinking of using the UR points on hotels. It doesn't seem like MR points transfer as well to hotels.

This is the itinerary I came up with and points/cost for each leg.

* TPA > JFK on JetBlue (Coach for 7.3k or $119 per Person)

* JFK > HNL on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First 80k MR Points per Person)

* HNL > OGG on Hawaiian ($73 per Person - I will try to see if I can get the Amex Plat Reimbursement on these.)

* OGG > SFO on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First $567.33 per Person)

* SFO > FLL on JetBlue (Mint for 33.7k or $449 per Person)

* FLL > TPA on Southwest (8k or $134 per Person)


Total:

* 73.8k JetBlue (for 2 People w/10% Credit from JetBlue Plus Card) ~1.84 cents/point

* 160k MR Points (for 2 People) ~2.09 cents/point

* 16k SW Points ~1.67 cents/point

* $1,280.66 (for 2 People)

Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

I have saved up a couple hundred thousand UR points over the past several years and will lose my ability to transfer them out this week for almost one year (read: I will be cancelling my cards and will remain 5/24 with an income that is 1/2-1/3 my current cumulative CL until next Summer). My home airport for the next year is RDU, which is serviced by most airlines (https://www.rdu.com/airline-information/rdu-airlines/), and I have already transferred some URs to WN and UA. 

Is it worth transferring more URs to other airlines in case I fly? I was thinking that Virgin Atlantic might be worthwhile, given the possibility of booking award flights on Delta, since Delta flights tend to be more expensive. Of course, there are many other transfer options and I could also sit on the points for the next year, though I worry about sitting on all of them for that long, not knowing when subsequent devaluation/new restrictions (e.g. not allowing transfer of URs between cards) might occur.

This guy I know from church is always flying around in business/first class on United or Star Alliance metal.

Turns out he bought his ticket in Economy (fare code T/L) and paid $50 in ?Preferred Zone Assignment? charges ($25 one way). His original seats were def in Economy based on the seat number.

But I can see that his current seat is in Biz or First class. He credits his miles to another airline so no way he?s even an Elite member. Looking at the upgrade list 0 people have been upgraded for that flight.

This plane for this leg has changed 3 different times and is now the 777-200 (was originally the Dreamliner going to Newark). I know that first availability only opens up about 2 weeks out and after looking at flights that are 2 weeks out right now, it looks like first saver is 80k.

"2015-07-25 19:13:19"|"FAQ: US - Japan"|"As I put the finishing touches on my April 2016 LAX - Japan trip, I decided to write a little something something to help others and myself place this popular award travel dream into perspective. The following will set clear some questions that come up a lot both on this subreddit and /r/churning. By no means am I an avid award traveler. This is mostly from my research/FME. No loyalty to an airliner is regarded.

These are some Frequently Asked Questions regarding award travel to Japan from the US. These start very basic and then get a bit more complicated.



**1.) What is the most efficient way to get to Japan from the US via award travel?**

Definitely American Airlines AAdvantage Miles. 

One-way award seats at 25k (off-peak),50k, 62.5k miles for econ, business, first are difficulty to beat. Especially when the competition usually charges high fees. Plus, you earn 10% back on points if you have an AA Aviator Red, Aviator Silver, Platinum Select, Executive credit card open.



**2.) Where are all the US - Japan award flights on AA.com? They are not showing up!**

Many (all?) partner flights do not even show up AA.com. Search on British Airway's (start here), Qantas', or Japan Airlines' award reservation system. Note the flight #. Call AA's reservation line @ 1-800-882-8880. Make sure to tell them the flight is not visible on aa.com, but you know for a fact it exist and is available. The CS rep. should waive the phone booking fee because of this comment.



**3.) I still do not see award flights on the BA/Qantas/JAL award reservation system. How can I get the flight I want?**

Well they obviously exist. Please note that availability is quite low, especially for the business and first class seats. You may have to book close to 11 months in advance to be sure you get the ticket on the dates you want.

Some have had luck booking flights weeks/days before departure. Sometimes additional reward seats are released close to departure. Huge YMMV here. So good luck.



**4.) I do not have enough AA miles and cannot churn to the needed AA miles (for X reason). I got loads of United and Delta points though. What are some of my options?**

United will charge 70k miles for a round-trip award ticket. [Further breakdown regarding partners and ticket type here.](http://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx) Expect much higher fees with United compared to AA. United's reservation system will show most all partnered award flights.

Sorry IDK shit about Delta :D. All I know is its possible. Delta's reservation system will show a decent amount of partnered award flights, and Delta miles are not as efficient as the competition.



**5.) I want to see much of Japan. How much are Japan Domestic flights?**

British Airways will charge 4,500 miles plus a $2 fee for one-way JAL domestic flights. You can travel between major cities via The Bullet Train...



**6.) I want to see much of Japan. Is The Bullet Train worth using when on budget compared to British Airways short haul flights? What is the JR pass and what are its key limitation? How can I get it for free?**

Yes, the Bullet Train (Shinkansen) is worth it if you get the JR pass. The passes start at 29,110 Yen (currently this is $234.02 on 21/7/2015) for the seven day option. 

The JR pass key limitation that we care about is the fact that it can only be bought when outside of Japan and can only be bought my tourists. There are many rules and limitations, but it is still worth. I've read that the Green JR Pass is not worth for the typical tourist.

[Please read through all the rules here.](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/) There are many ways to use the pass and it would be unfortunate to realize a specific thing you wanted to use it for is not allowed.

You can get it for free by redeeming points/""miles"" against the charge. Like on the Arrival +, Cap1 Venture, or other credit cards of the like. Sign-up bonuses for these cards are higher than the cost of the JR pass.

*The JR Pass will code as Tourist Attaction on the Arrival +. You will have to call to get the charge erased with your points. We don't know how the recent changes to the Arrival + effected this option.



**7.) What about award stays at hotels? Any recommendations?**

Redeeming the two free nights [from this Chase sign-up bonus](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/hyatt-card.aspx) at the Park Hyatt Tokyo is a very popular option around here. Book ahead since availability is killer.

The SPG Sheraton in Osaka is an extremely cheap points option @4k points a night.

Cannot go wrong with AirBnB. Japanese hospitality is highly regarded. The host may really help you out here. Statement credit points/miles can be used to cover AirBnB charges.



**8.) What sort of awards can I redeem if I want to fly Singapore Airlines? Should I redeem through United or Singapore if I have the option?**

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles can be redeemed at 32.5k, 77.5k, and 87.5k miles for econ, business, and first class/suites respectfully when flying from West Coast US. [Go here to look at their full award chart.](http://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQMI_OneWayAwardCharts.pdf) Now take into account the 15% miles discount if you book online and Singapore Airlines' legendary service quality. You are getting great value for these options.

Amex MR, Chase UR, Citi TY points, and SPG points can all be transferred to Singapore KrisFlyer miles. So you have a lot of easy churning strategies.

Note that some Singapore Air econ and business tickets are on sale right now (as of 21/07/2015) and may not be worth booking econ with miles. It will always be very worth it to redeem miles for Singapore Business/First Class/Suite award seats.

Also, keep it mind that Singapore Air charges above average fees for award tickets. We talking slightly over $100 for SFO/LAX - HND/NRT business; still worth though.

United will charge less for the econ seat, both in points and fees. Unfortunately, United charges more points for business and first class/suite. Also, United has less availible award seats than their partners on a per partner flight bases. If you don't see an business/first class award seat on United, it may still be open on Singapore.



**9.) What other great business and first class award seats are available?**

The Points Guy talks highly about the JAL First class experience. Plus, its only 62.5k AA miles for one-way award seat. Avalibility is extremely low so book well in advanced. Do a little research on the service and you'll fall in love.



**10.) What are you going to do in Japan?**

"2017-01-09 06:09:26"|"UA has unexpectedly pulled service between SFO-AKL from April through October this year. Had June 2017 booking (2 J seats) since last Oct. They say we're SOL. Any options at all??"|"Have been on the phone with various reps all day today. Some have hung up, some just pretend to transfer me to a supervisor and then hang up, and some are trying to be helpful but clearly have no power. They all say that there is no more J award availability, that literally the only thing they can do is refund my points. Of course, there's no question that we're absolutely SOL if that happens, because there's no longer any award availability even in Y. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

EDIT - How it went down:

This was a UA operated flight redeemed with UA miles. Official details on UA pulling the service are few and far between, but these two before-and-after articles (and the recent updates to the FT thread) are interesting reading: 

1. http://newsroom.united.com/2016-07-01-United-Airlines-Says-Kia-Ora-to-Auckland

2.  J/K! http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11778240

Just a note for any other travellers in this position: The Herald states, (whether of their own accord or via a statement from UA),  ""Passengers who have already purchased tickets during the suspended period are being contacted by the airline and offered flights on the Air New Zealand service instead."" In my experience today, at least for premium award bookings, this is just not true. To begin with, Air New Zealand's akl-sfo craft has slightly fewer premium seats than the 787 Dreamliner. Additionally, it does not appear that they've agreed to open up (m)any? of those premium seats for UA award bookings. We had a couple reps try and book them for us but they were never able to get the override.

u/LumpyLump76, u/aves137, and u/weibelt - I really appreciate your quick responses. I was still on the phone with a manager (finally!) at the time, and it helped me be firm but reasonable in my expectations. 

I truly hope that this goes better for everyone else. The manager referenced the fact that this service change was very recent and said that there wasn't really a plan in the works aside from offering a refund, since they had no way to induce Air NZ to open award availability. But maybe they'll have a decent, legitimate plan in place for other travellers on these flights; maybe I jumped the gun by wanting a resolution asap. 

Here's how it shook out (just received the re-booking confirmation email): Our original booking was AKL-SFO (J), and SFO-DEN (Y). We rebooked for AKL-SYD (Y), SYD-SFO (J), and SFO-DEN (J). For our original cost of 70k UA each, I'm okay with that outcome."
"2018-01-30 22:23:11"|"Chase UR --> USA to NZ lie-flat (business and/or first)"|"I've got roughly 320,000 points on Chase UR and want to go to New Zealand with my wife.  I don't really care what airline it is, but I'd love to maximize utility of my points and also get lie-flat seats (whether that means Business or First, I don't know).

As far as timing goes, I'm hoping to do this in December.

Through the bit of research I've done so far, it seems I probably need to convert my Chase UR to United miles (at 1:1 ratio).

Assuming that's the best route, my questions are:
Do I actually book through United or do I go to Air New Zealand?
How does ""award availability"" work?  Do I stand any chance of accomplishing this and how about this far in advance of the travel date?

Thanks so much!"
"2016-03-01 15:22:59"|"Trip Report - Cathay Pacific 777-300ER First Class - HKG-ORD"|"This was the tail end flight of a 2 week jaunt I had throughout Asia a few weeks back. As always, you can read the whole [report with pictures here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/review-cathay-pacific-777-300er-first-class-hkg-ord/). As a reminder, make sure you are posting up your trip reports - economy included!

This flight was part of the American Airlines award ticket I booked from Singapore back to Orlando. Since this segment was included in my American Airlines redemption, it set me back 67,500 AAdvantage miles. By comparison, paid tickets were running ~$10,200 for a one-way flight on this route in first class, so when you factor in the business class ticket from Singapore and a connecting flight to Orlando, that is an absolutely stellar redemption value.

As we exited The Wing First Class Lounge (which was ""meh"" compared to the incredible The Pier First Class Lounge) we turned left and were pretty much right at our gate. Before you could enter the gate area there was a queue of people where security was ?searching? people?s bags. They basically just opened my bag up and moved a jacket over, then re-closed it. It really give me a strong sense of safety and security on this flight.

**Cathay Pacific 806**

**Hong Kong (HKG) ? Chicago-O?Hare (ORD)**

**Depart: 11:50 AM**

**Arrive: 12:25 PM**

**Duration: 12 hours, 35 minutes**

**Aircraft: Boeing 777-300ER**

**Seat: 2A (First Class)**


By the time we reached the gate, boarding of all cabins had already begun. There was a separate line for first class, business class and economy passengers. We proceeded directly to the first class line where our tickets were scanned and we were directed down the jet bridge. We entered through door 1L and turned right into the first class cabin. We were met at the door by the purser who directed us to our seats ? 1A and 2A.

Cathay Pacific?s 777-3ooERs feature only 6 seats in First Class in a 1-1-1 configuration.

[CX F Cabin Layout](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CX-Layout.png?w=397)

I much prefer seats 1A and 2A as they are the only two seats that share the aisle on the left hand side of the aircraft which makes it feel much more private. The middle seats are completely blocked off, so you really have a sense that you are in your own world.

[Divider On Left Side Of Aircraft](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2567.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After making my way back to seat 2A, I saw home for the next 12 hours.

[CX F Seat](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2539.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

One thing to note about the first class cabin is that there are no overhead bins like JAL offers on their 777-300ERs. Instead, there are little lockers that you can store your bags in. The problem is, they are pretty tight ? especially for a 22? roller bag like I travel with. This locker is also where you are supposed to hang your jacket, which with a bag in there just does not work. Sorry for the poor picture quality of the locker.

[CX F Locker For Bags](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2682.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I ended up needing to place the blanket on my ottoman as it was originally in the locker and would not fit with my two bags ? an exceedingly poor design in my opinion. After some finagling I was able to get my two carry on bags stored and started to check out the seat. Waiting at the seat was a pillow which was rather thin.

[CX F Seat](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2537.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

To the left of the seat was the seat controller screen and the in-flight entertainment (IFE) system remote control.

[CX F Controllers](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2541.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The seat controller is a touch screen unit that was not super responsive. I am not sure if that was just my seat, but I consistently had to touch the screen multiple times in different areas to get the seat to move at all.

[CX F Seat Controller](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2578.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Below the seat controls and IFE controller there is a storage area which was relatively shallow, but was good for holding my computer and cell phone chargers.

[CX F Seat Storage](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2562.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The seat is incredibly spacious at 36? of width and features an armrest that drops down from the side of the seat.

[CX F Seat Armrest](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2568.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I actually really like this feature as it allows you plenty of space if you are lounging in the seat, while also offering you some more traditional seat structure when you wanted to do some work.

Opposite the seat was a nice ottoman which features storage underneath and can double as a companion seat if you wanted to dine with a travel companion.

[CX F Ottoman](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2538.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

To the left of the ottoman was an international style power plug along with a USB and S-Video plug.

[CX F Plugs](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2561.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

To the right of the ottoman was the IFE screen, which fits into the storage locker area.

[IFE Screen 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2540.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The IFE screen is also a touch screen and swings out and pivots around to wherever you desire.

[IFE Screen 2](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2603.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Also waiting at the seat was the traditional orchid which was real and is a very classy touch.

[CX F Orchid](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2573.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After getting settled in the in-flight service manager, Alina, came by to introduce herself and welcome us aboard. We were offered our selection of a pre-departure beverage and although I am not really a champagne fan, I opted for a glass of champagne.

[Pre-Departure Beverage](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2543.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We were also offered the traditional amuse bouche, which was a smoked tuna and mango dish that was very tasty.

[Amuse Bouche](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2542.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific serves Krug champagne in their first class cabin. Everyone always raves about it, but I honestly just do not get it. It tasted no different to me than most other champagnes. After the smoke tuna amuse Alina brought out piping hot towels, which was really nice.

[Hot Towel](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2548.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Alina then came back around with pajamas, which were Pye.

[CX F Pajamas 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2552.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific?s First Class pajamas are a burgundy color and really made me feel like an emperor since the top has buttons from top to bottom. They seemed to run true to size.

[CX F Pajamas 2](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2635.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Also included in the pajama bag were a pair of slippers and a Cathay Pacific branded eye mask.

[CX F Pajamas 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2637.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The pajamas were comfortable and fairly soft, but I have to give the edge to JAL on comfort and softness when it comes to their pajamas.

Alina also handed me an Aesop amenity kit. There were separate amenity kits for male and female passengers.

[Amenity Kit 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2549.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The male amenity kit included a comb, a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, face cream, a glass cleaning cloth, ear plugs and body lotion.

[Amenity Kit 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2641.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Lastly, Alina passed out a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones which were very comfortable.

[Noise Cancelling Headphones](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2550.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

While checking out the cabin I noticed there was a hump in the ceiling which was direct above seat 1D.

[Ceiling Hump](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2558.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cool random fact ? that is actually the pilot rest area and there is a little bed up there!

One thing to note about Cathay Pacific?s First Class seats is that while they are in the upright position, it is quite a stretch to reach the ottoman. I am 6?5? and could barely reach it myself. And yes, those are crabs on my socks ? my sock game is on point.

[Stretched Out To Ottoman](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2551.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I spent the remainder of the boarding process enjoying some great views of the 777-300ER parked next to us.

[CX 777-300ER](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2555.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

There also happened to be an older gentleman on the flight who was in seat 2K who had been bumped up from Business Class to First Class. He spent pretty much the entire boarding time calling anyone and everyone he could to let them know that he had been bumped up to First Class. Based on his baggage choice (Rimowa) and his familiarity with the aircraft, he seemed like he was a regular traveler, so the phone calls surprised me a bit. But then again, who among us does not love a free op-up upgrade?!

About 10 minutes before we pushed back, the Australian captain came on the PA to welcome everyone aboard. He also advised us that he strongly recommended that we keep our seat belts fastened as he expected it to be a bumpy ride over the northern Pacific. Within a few minutes the cabin doors were closed and we pushed back.

As the safety video played, my eyes were glued to the window as Hong Kong Airport offers some great views while taxiing.

[HKG Taxiing 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2571.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We taxied right past the 747 cargo planes, which always makes me happy to see a 747 in the wild.

[HKG Taxiing 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2565.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Interestingly, while we were on an active taxi way, the first officer came out from the cockpit, opened door 1L and then re-closed it. I am guessing this was due to a sensor in the cockpit showing that door 1L was still open, but the re-opening and closing was never explained to anyone. Apparently re-closing the door seemed to work as we continued our taxi after that.

One thing I found very cool is that Cathay Pacific?s IFE system on their 777-300ERs features an outside camera which is mounted on the bottom of the fuselage just behind the front wheel. My eyes were glued to it during the takeoff.

[Exterior Camera View](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2560.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We took off from runway 7R and were quickly airborne rolling out over Kowloon Island and Hong Kong Island. It was a crystal clear day so the views were spectacular.

[Hong Kong Views 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2576.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

About 10 minutes after takeoff the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off. The two flight attendants working the First Class cabin ? Joy and Ibuki ? then came around presenting passengers with the menu for the flight. The menu was served on a nice wooden plate.

[CX F Menu 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2583.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Since our flight coincided with the Chinese New Year, Cathay Pacific was offering special puddings on the flight to celebrate the Year of the Monkey. Neither sounded very appealing to me, so I never tried either.

[CX F CNY Menu](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2585.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The drink menu was quite extensive as well and featured some very good wines.

Lunch service began promptly and started with a serving of warm mixed nuts. I opted for another glass of champagne, mainly because I would be trying the caviar again to see if the combination would somehow win me over (spoiler alert ? it did not).

Cathay Pacific puts some kind of smoke seasoning on their nuts which I really just do not care for as it is pretty overpowering.

Joy then came around to set my table, which pulls out from the compartment to the left of the seat. The lunch service started with a tin of caviar.

[Caviar Service 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2617.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cathay Pacific serves Calvisius caviar.

[Caviar Service 2](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2618-e1456764270567.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The caviar was served with the usual accompaniments, a bread basket and a glass of still water.

The bread basket contained an assortment of rolls and a piece of Cathay Pacific?s delicious garlic bread.

[Bread Basket](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2619.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Also served on the tray was a nice hand written note from Joy and Ibuki wishing me an enjoyable flight.

[Note From FAs](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2616.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I thought this was a really nice personal touch.

I have to say though, I just do not get the love that people have for champagne and caviar. I was trying hard this trip to understand it, but I just could not.

After the caviar, Joy brought me a bowl of the cream of chicken soup.

[Cream of Chicken Soup Starter](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2622.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

It was served at the perfect temperature and very tasty.

Next came the mesclun salad.

[Salad starter](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2623.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

It was very colorful and nicely presented, but kind of bland tasting.

For my main course I opted for the pan fried prawns with risotto.

[Pan Fried Prawns 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2626.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The prawns were just ok and somewhat bland themselves and the risotto was more of a rice pilaf than a risotto.

[Pan Fried Prawns 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2625.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After the main course, Ibuki brought me a hot towel and took my order for dessert.

[Post Lunch Hot Towel](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2627.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I decided to be a fat kid for dessert since I could not decided between the berries and cream and the fruit tart ? so I ordered both.

[Berries & Cream Dessert](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2628.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The berries and cream were beautifully presented and very delicious. The cream was more of a milky yogurt consistency, but the combination was still excellent.

I also ordered a cappuccino with dessert, which was served with brown sugar cubes.

[Cappuccino](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2633.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Ibuki also brought my cappuccino with cocoa dusted almonds, a truffle and a chocolate bar with almonds in it ? all of which were excellent.

[Sweets Assortment](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2632.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The real star of dessert though was the almond pear tart. It was served with salted caramel ice cream and was incredible. It was so good I would literally fly Cathay Pacific again for that alone.

[Almond Pear Tart](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2634.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The lunch service lasted about an hour and a half from start to finish. After lunch I went into the lavatory to change into my pajamas. The lavatories had a somewhat modern feel to them and in the First Class cabin feature real linen towels.

[CX F Lavatory](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2545.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

As with the amenity kit, the lotions and soaps in the lavatory are also Aesop.

[CX Lavatory Lotions & Soaps](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2547.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

One thing I will note is that on our JAL flight, the flight attendants took my clothes and hung them up for me in the closet. On our Cathay Pacific flight that did not happen. I am guessing that is because there is a locker with hangers in it at every seat, but with a roller bag stowed in the there is no room to actually hang clothes. It was a poor layout in my opinion and was another example of why I actually prefer JAL First Class to Cathay Pacific First Class.

After I changed into the pajamas I perused the CX Studio options looking for something to watch while relaxing.

[CX Studio 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2608.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

[CX Studio 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2609.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

[CX Studio 3](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2610.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

[CX Studio 4](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2611.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

[CX Studio 5](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2612.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cathay?s CX Studio selection is quite vast and includes everything from current popular TV shows like HBO?s Ballers to new (to video) release movies like Our Brand Is Crisis. I opted to watch Our Brand Is Crisis and it was quite good.

It is also worth noting that if you are traveling with young children, CX Studio offers a separate kids entertainment section.

[CX Studio Kids](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2613.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After watching Our Brand Is Crisis, I pulled my laptop out to do some work. I also ordered a glass of the Glenmorangie Signet.

[Glenmorangie Signet 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2644.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The Signet was very good and I had several more after that.

[Glenmorangie Signet 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2645.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

In fact, I finished half the bottle before I knew it! That made me a bit sleepy so I ended up ~~passing out~~ sleeping for about an hour. When I woke up I decided to watch another movie. This time I opted to watch Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks. Being a history nerd, I thought the movie was excellent. I also ordered another cappuccino which was served with a little biscotti cookie.

[Cappuccino & Biscotti](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2647.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

During the movie I started to get a bit hungry. I had been craving a burger and sure enough, there was one on the snack menu! The snack menu read as follows:

[CX F Snack Menu](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2587.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

When I ordered the burger Ibuki told me it would probably take about 20 minutes to prepare, which was no problem. About 20 minutes later Ibuki brought the burger out with a glass of ice water.

[CX F Snack](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2649.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I gotta say, I pride myself on fully immersing myself in the local culture when I travel, but after 2 weeks, this burger was damn good! The beef was actually cooked to a nice medium, was juicy and very flavorful. I had debated between the British tea trio and the burger since I knew the tea trio was also very good, but I am very happy I opted for the burger instead.

I ended up doing a few more hours worth of work at which time we were approaching the west coast of the Canada. The sunrise from 40,000 feet is always awe inspiring to me.

[Sunrise Over West Coast](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2669.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I guess if I had to pick an office view, this would definitely be the one I would pick.

[""Office"" View](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2671.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

About a half hour later Joy came by to take my order for breakfast. The breakfast menu read as follows:

[CX F Breakfast Menu](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2587.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I ordered scrambled eggs with fresh fruit, yogurt, a banana muffin and a Hong Kong style milk tea, which Cathay Pacific executes excellently in my opinion.

Breakfast started with a warm towel.

[CX F Pre-Breakfast Warm Towel](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2673.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

At that point we hit some pretty bad turbulence which put a stop to the meal service as the captain asked the flight attendants to take their seats. That lasted for about 35 minutes after which point the meal service was resumed.

Joy came back to set my table and started me off with some fresh fruit and the banana muffin.

[CX F Breakfast 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2674.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The fresh fruit was good, though I really do not like the grapes they serve on Cathay Pacific as they contain big seeds.

[Fresh Fruit](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2675.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The banana muffin was insanely good and was served piping hot.

[Banana Muffin](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2676.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Joy then came back with my Hong Kong style milk tea which was well executed as always and paired nicely with the banana muffin.

[Hong Kong Style Milk Tea](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2678.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Next the yogurt was served separately. I had never had this particular brand before, but it was very good.

[Strawberry Yogurt](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2680.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After the yogurt, Joy came back with my main course ? the scrambled eggs.

[Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Sausage & Potatoes](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2681.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

To be honest, it was pretty disappointing. The eggs were soft scrambled and runny, which I do not care for. The potatoes were soft, mushy and a bit on the chewy side. The bacon was almost entirely fat and the sausage link actually did not look fully cooked when I cut into it. I had a few bites of the eggs and left the rest. It was not quite as bad as the egg dish on Hong Kong Airlines, but it was pretty close.

After I finished breakfast I headed to the lavatory to change out of my pajamas. By the time I had re-stowed my bags and got settled back into my seat we were starting our descent into Chicago.

[Airshow](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2724.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I enjoyed some of the views of the Illinois coast as we came in.

[Illinois Coast On Approach](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2686.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

It was a pretty clear day and our routing took us right past downtown and the Sears Tower.

[Downtown Chicago](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2688.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We also ended up with a pretty good view of Navy Pier as we came around on approach.

[Navy Pier 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2690.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

As we started our final approach into O?Hare, I switched on the nose camera to enjoy the view on landing.

[Landing 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2700.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

We had a smooth touchdown about 10 minutes earlier than our scheduled arrival time. It was a fairly short taxi to the gate, but there was some cool air traffic on the ground like this Korean Air 777-300ER on its way to Seoul.

[KE 777-300ER](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2723.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After a quick 5 minute taxi we arrived at our gate. We thanked the cabin crew on our way off and then headed for immigration which we cleared quickly thanks to Global Entry.

The crew on this flight were good, but I cannot say that they were great. While both Joy and Ibuki were very nice and extremely attentive, it did not seem like Joy really wanted to be there ? and it showed. As is typical with Cathay Pacific, the flight attendants take a more hands off approach to give their passengers some privacy. Though as soon as you hit the flight attendant call button they are at your seat within seconds.

Overall, I think it was a very good flight, though I have to give the edge to JAL on food and service. The Cathay Pacific seat is incredibly comfortable and the IFE system is definitely designed better though so Cathay beats out JAL on those items. At the end of the day though, we are really just splitting hairs here are both are an exceptional way to travel though!"
"2016-11-07 18:57:31"|"Airline Loyalty Advice"|"I'll be starting a new job soon that will have me traveling domestically with about two roundtrip flights each month on average.  I'm going back and forth between American and United for loyalty purposes.  Both seem to provide good coverage to the Midwest (where I'll be traveling most) from my home base, DCA.

I definitely prefer the experience on American over United, and American award flights seem to be better values than United awards, but I'm wondering if I should be more concerned about aligning my CC spend to the airline of choice.  As of right now, I have the whole gamut of Chase UR cards that I love because of their point-earning opportunities and their benefits (CSR, Freedom, FU, Ink, etc), which obviously better suites United.  I do have the Citi AA Plat as well, which I wasn't planning on holding onto past the annual fee but it certainly is an option if it's for the best.  *I plan on keeping my CSR long term as I get to charge all work expenses to my personal cards.*

What I suppose this boils down to are the following questions:

1) I plan to maintain the vast majority of my spend on the Chase cards.  Should I pick United over American since the points are transferable?

2) Should I keep the Citi AA Plat and charge only flights to it?  Does this help me earn status faster?

3) Are there any finer points to this that I seem to be missing?  My priorities are very close between gaining status and getting award flights, but I suppose status squeaks by on top since I can churn my way to award flights for now.

Thank you all for your help!  On a side note, I just redeemed 160k AA for F and 130k UR for J on United for my SO and I to take a Japan trip.  I'll be sure to do a trip report when finished.


EDIT:  Just wanted to say thanks for all of the insight, and to correct my incorrect use of wordz."
"2016-02-24 00:14:43"|"A Guide to Asia Miles (Cathay Pacific)"|"Hello /r/awardtravel,


I'm writing this little guide to Asia Miles simply because, IMO, a decent enough one does not exist anywhere on the web!


I went through hell trying to figure this FF program out the past 3 months and I wanted to share my knowledge so people don't make the same mistakes I did. 


Also for people to understand there is another decent FF program out there that can fly them almost anywhere in the world and at (sometimes) competitive award prices.
The following information includes over 15 calls to Asia Miles, at least 20 hours of hold time, a few months of reading, making many posts on this subreddit(see [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3uoxnx/laxberzag_using_qantas_miles/),[here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/40db5e/mr_and_spg_transfer_to_asia_miles_question/), and [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/42pn5h/asia_miles_cannot_see_aer_lingus_flight_even/) and flyertalk, and over 60 hours of research(mostly trial and error?so much error).


&nbsp;


**Why you should care (pros):**

&nbsp;

* Amex MR, SPG, and Citi TYP are all transfer partners


* Asia Miles partners with many carriers. Here is the most current list: Aer Lingus, Air Berlin, Air China, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Bangkok Airways, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern, DragonAir, Finnair, Gulf Air, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, LAN, Malaysia, Qantas, Qatar, Royal Brunei, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Sri Lankan Airlines, TAM, and US Airways


* You can make a maximum of five stopovers, two transfers and two open-jaws at either origin, en-route or turnaround point (This excludes Iberia and Air China). This means you can get crazy good redemptions with your miles given availability and you do your homework.


* You can mix up to THREE carriers in one redemption when you fly one of your legs with Cathay Pacific or DragonAir. You can mix up to TWO different carriers in a single redemption when you fly all other partners.

&nbsp;

**Why you shouldn?t care (cons):**

&nbsp;

* Terrible customer service and hold times. You have to hold their hand the entire way and then call back every day to follow-up. Don?t ever expect them to get it right the first time. They never once did for me.


* Miles required for some routes are not worth it to many (This is a distance based award system).


* Just because you see a partner on the list that you like doesn?t mean Asia Miles will allow booking on that partner. More on this below.

&nbsp;

*Everything I state going forward is recommended to be done in the order listed. This is important in getting a successful booking and it will make sense towards the end*


&nbsp;


**[Award Charts and Conditions](https://www.asiamiles.com/am/en/redeem/charts#2)**

&nbsp;

CX and KA are on the top chart. 

OneWorld is towards the bottom.


&nbsp;


**Before you transfer, check your route!**

&nbsp;

On Asia Miles website:

* click on **Redeem**


* click on **Flight Award Finder**


* Login


* Enter your Ticket-type(usually round-trip or one-way), destination and departing airports. 


* Then review your airline options. These are the partners you will be able to book with. If they do not show up, they DO NOT fly that route. So even if you know that airline usually flies that route and with award seats on different alliances or their own, it does not mean they open it up to Asia Miles for booking.


* Then click **calculate.** This will be your total cost. As far as I know, it?s been accurate.


&nbsp;


**Searching for award availability**

&nbsp;

*This is where I may need data points.* 



I did my flight for Europe, so I am very familiar with those partners:


Partner| How to find Award Availability 
---------|----------
Aer Lingus | Expert Flyer(flights found on QF or BA will not show up on their systems)
Air Berlin | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
American Airlines | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
Iberia | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
British Airways | Asia Miles Flight Awards ? Redeem Online
Qantas | Asia Miles Flight Awards ? Redeem Online
DragonAir| Asia Miles Flight Awards ? Redeem Online
Qatar | Asia Miles Flight Awards ? Redeem Online
Finnair | Asia Miles Flight Awards ? Redeem Online


&nbsp;


**Transferring points over?**

&nbsp;

*Time Frames and Name Restrictions*

&nbsp;

Membership Rewards | ThankYou Points | SPG
---------|----------|----------
3 ? 5 Business Days | 24 ? 48 Hours | 4 ? 5 Days
Name Restriction Relaxed*| Name Restriction Relaxed* | Name Restriction Strict*

&nbsp;


\*Relaxed means you **may** be able to get away with middle names/initials or entirely different names given you enter the correct membership number. Strict means that you have your name matching between the loyalty program and Asia Miles exactly. Otherwise your points/miles may go missing for up to a month.




*Protip: Have all your programs match your passport. Asia Miles will not issue you your ticket unless it matches. If they have to make a change, they will ask for you to send in a picture of your passport. And IME, that may delay your booking for another week*


&nbsp;


**Booking your flight**

&nbsp;

For all partners except for the ones listed below, which can be booked on their website, will require you to call in (unfortunately for you):

* Cathay Pacific


* Dragonair


* British Airways


* Qantas Airways


* Qatar Airways


* Finnair

&nbsp;

Also, if you are trying to do open jaw or stopovers in your flight you will also have to call since their website doesn't allow input for this type of itinerary. 


If you?re in the United States the number to call is 1-866-892-2598 and press 1,1,enter your membership id and #, 0, then 1 or 2(1-yes to customer survey, 2-no). 


The best time to call is after 9pm PST or before 8am PST. It is a 24-hour service line, but if you call outside of my recommended times, prepare to be on hold for up to 3 hours as well as facing random disconnects after an hour or so or a voicemail. 


Surprise, they never listen to their voicemail and they most definitely won?t return your call if you leave your number.


Guide them to the flight you want and hopefully they can see the availability you do. Ask them to reserve the seat. On every partner I called in about, I was able to reserve seats for at least 2-4 days. This may not be true with every partner. This is when you reserve the seat then transfer your points over. 


Of course this is never a guarantee that your seats will not all of a sudden disappear. But I haven?t seen any data points with any carrier where someone reserves seats with a partner and then they lose the seat when they call to complete the booking, but of course, if you have any data points, please reply below. Also *make sure you have your ducks in a row on the transfers as far as name matching goes!*


&nbsp;


**Fees**

&nbsp;

Fees for OneWorld alliance partners will be similar to what you see on BA?s website.


For Cathay Pacific, you are likely looking at the following fees:


* Fees and taxes imposed by government, other authority, or by the operator of an airport are HKD50.00 or more, and additional carrier-imposed charges, surcharges or fees of HKD193.00 or more will apply. The actual required miles and government and airport taxes/fees plus all carrier-imposed surcharges for all passengers will be advised at the time of booking.


More data points needed.


&nbsp;


**Upgradability**


&nbsp;


You may upgrade your seat from economy to business class, given only that there is no premium economy available on that flight. Upgrades on most partners will cost 10,000 Asia Miles or $100 for them to re-issue your ticket. This does not apply to Cathay Pacific, British Airways, and DragonAir as their policy statement posted on the award chart link states upgrades available at no extra cost.

&nbsp;

**Refunds**

If you would like to cancel a booking and get your miles refunded back, you may do so. But it will cost you $120/ticket. (HT: /u/highlander311)

If anyone has any input or data points, please post it! Especially for the sections that state ?more data points needed.? I will edit and add to post.


Thanks!

"2015-06-25 04:59:40"|"Need some advice on my first Award Vacation!"|"Hello /r/awardtravel! I?m looking for some advice on my first vacation using mostly points. Been doing a lot of reading and research over the past 4 months and now I just need some guidance on how to book.

I can fly out of TUS or PHX and my goal is to take myself and my SO to Barcelona, Spain (BCN) -> Rome, Italy (FCO) -> Ibiza (IBZ) -> Barcelona, Spain (BCN).

Dates are flexible between March 8th - March 20th, 2016. Looking to travel between 7-10 days.

This is what I currently have: 66k MR, 94k UR and 48k Arrival+ Miles.

I?m understanding that the least points needed to get to BCN is 60k for a round trip flight via United per person. So I would need 26k more UR. Is there anyway that I can use my MR points for two one way flights to BCN and use my UR for the two returning flights? 

For short flights between BCN, FCO and IBZ I?m noticing a lot of inexpensive flights with not so friendly airlines (Ryanair). Would that be the best route to take for those flights?

I?m also in the process in researching the best cards for hotel says for this vacation as well. I?m mostly concerned about the flights right now.

Any other information that would help me would be amazing! Thank you"
"2019-05-25 09:41:24"|"Lots of J seats between US and New Zealand in July -- bookable with 97K MR/TYP RT"|"Premium award flights to New Zealand/Australia from the US are well known to be some of the hardest awards to snatch, with Air NZ flights being some of the rarer even among that set. We also recently got a guide written up which may have sparked some additional interest. 


I searched United for Air New Zealand space for a trip I'm making and was very surprised by the liberal availability. Currently NZ has J space open on **16** days in July for **LAX-AKL**, **10** days for **IAH-AKL**, and **7** days for **SFO-AKL**. 

In the reverse direction, availability is even more abundant. AKL-LAX and AKL-SFO both have **20(!)** days. **AKL-IAH** has **16** days. Some of these are double counting: AKL - SFO might be AKL-LAX-SFO. 

There are also some seats in May/June/August, but they are much more sparsely available compared to July. 

Air New Zealand is a partner of everyone's favorite airline of the day, Virgin Atlantic. A round trip J US-NZ ticket on them is 125K VS miles, and unlike ANA you can go one way for 62.5K. With the existing 30% transfer bonuses for TYP and MR, it's 97K points transferred to Virgin Atlantic to book a round trip. Given how hard this route is to book, it's a fantastic deal, even if Air New Zealand J is not the highest quality J product. 

Like ANA you can only book single segments, connecting flights are charged separately."
"2019-08-06 08:03:52"|"Award ticket cancelled (IRROPS etc)!! What to do! FAQ"|"""Help!!! My ticket is canceled!""

""United changed their schedule and made the connection impossible!!!""

""United cancelled IAH-SYD for my date....."" etc. 

So you booked an award ticket in first class, and of course something goes wrong. What can you do? 

This is the guide to what you can do in this situation. Feel free to inform me if any part of the guide is wrong, and leave comments about your rebooking experiences.

====================================

The situations are mostly categorized as:

- Whether the ticket is sold by a US carrier (United, AA, Delta), or Asian carrier (ANA, EVA, etc); I never bought an award ticket through European carriers, so can't comment on that

- Whether the airline that sold you the ticket flies the route, eg. both ANA and United flies SFO-NRT

For simplicity, I would call the airline that sold you the ticket ""ticketing carrier"" TC, and the metal ""operating carrier"" OC

Basic knowledge:

Q: Flight cancelled! Who do I call?

A: TC. They sold you the ticket. OC will most likely not willing to modify the ticket, and can only takeover the ticket T-24h to departure.

==================================
Scenarios

a. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through US carriers

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

b. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through Asian carriers

- They will do the same and rebook you to your desired route on their own metal. This is true for the recent EVA strike.

c. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC flies the route

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

d. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC flies the route

- Varies.

- ANA: They WILL NOT open up their own space. Eg. SFO-TPE Eva air ticket through ANA. ANA can fly SFO-NRT-TPE, but THEY WILL NOT rebook you on their own metal. If no award ticket exists, they will CANCEL your ticket, and issue a refund. You can try to do a three way call (you, TC, OC), but most likely won't get you too far.

- Singapore airlines: They will rebook onto their own metal. 

- Need data points for other Asian carriers. 

e. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- You are probably out of luck. TC can't open up it's own space since they don't fly there, and they can't force OC to open up award space. You can try a three way call but you won't get too far. If TC flies to a nearby airport or award space exists for a nearby airport (eg. United flies to EWR, and original ticket was JFK), they should be willing to change your destination.

f. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- Worst case scenario. You can do a three way call, but most likely the ticket will just be cancelled. 


This is what I have experienced, and read stories on. Please feel free to correct me and share your experiences.

Lastly, when a ticket is cancelled, please be rational. If you book an intra-China ticket on Air China through United and the ticket is cancelled, don't expect United to force Air China to open a ticket; the ticket will most likely be cancelled."
"2018-01-09 23:55:23"|"[award advice] 30th birthday trip to Thailand/Hong Kong"|"My husband and I have 350,000 UR points, with about 10K scattered around in Southwest, American, and British Airways. We live in Austin, and, while we could theoretically drive to SA or Houston to fly out, we have pets that need to be boarded, and my husband will need to come back on his own (see below for more info), so we both need easy access to home on our return.

We are looking to go to Thailand early May of this year. We would fly there together, but then my husband will come back on his own to Austin (limited vacation time), and I will fly to Hong Kong to meet a friend for a few days before returning home. We would prefer economy flights, unless there is a really good deal on a higher class cabin (but we would never pay cash for that, so are not necessarily looking to just splurge).

I've looked at prices on Google flights to start getting an idea of airlines that go where we need them to go, and it seems that there are nearly no 1-stop flights from Austin to Bangkok, and many of the flights offered on there are mixed airlines (i.e. not in the same alliance). We want to use points for the entire trip, and I would love to have him fly back from Thailand to somewhere state-side direct (although I'm actually surprised that there might not be any--I thought for sure BKK>LAX would exist but it doesn't!), but if that's not possible, he is an anxious traveler, so connecting him through one very user-friendly for English speakers airport would be fantastic. I am thinking that we will need to book 2 one-way flights, so that we can ensure we are on the same booking number on the way out, but on the way back, I will need to book separate flights.

This is all very complicated to me! Any insights or suggestions?

EDIT: I found an AUS>LAX>SIN>BKK flight on United for 40K, with the SIN>BKK segment being on Singapore Airlines (which I would love to experience, even if it's just cattle class)! I think I will go ahead and book that, which based on the comments so far seems like par for what I should expect to spend on the flight and a decently good flight itinerary. If anyone also has any great hotel UR redemptions for while we are in Thailand, that would also be appreciated! Thanks so far everyone!"

We would be leaving from Washington, DC, and most likely starting and ending in Tokyo. We haven't figured out a complete itinerary, but I'm thinking 1.5 weeks, and we would hit up Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo.

We currently have the following miles/points:

- 300K Ultimate Rewards points

- 50K Membership Rewards points

- 250K American Airlines miles

- 68K United miles

- 36K SPG points

We would like to travel business class both ways. Ideally, I would like to book with United one way because I am going to cancel my MPE card when the AF hits, and I want to use all of the points while I still have the increased award availability. We can transfer UR points to United, so we could transfer exactly enough needed for two one ways in business and zero my United account out.

Was thinking AA for the other way, as AA miles are much easier to accumulate than UR points (we are both over 5/24).

Am I thinking through this correctly? Want to make sure we get the best use of our points on the best airline."

I have 600,000 UR points but can't find a way to use them. I go every year to the UK in the spring and I'm finding that my points/miles are becoming more and more useless to get where I want to go.

I'm looking at going from JFK to Manchester on June 8. There's a great cash fare of ~$250 nonstop on Thomas Cook Airlines (Condor subsidiary), baggage included. But I can't book it with my CSR at 1.5cpp- the airline doesn't show up on the UR Travel Portal, and the agents on the phone can't book it. Annoying.

I'm going to be staying at a Premier Inn in Manchester close to my grandparents. Premier Inn is one of the largest mid-range UK chain hotels, like a Holiday Inn. Great prices, about ~$240 for a 4 night stay. But again, the Premier Inn doesn't show up on the UR Travel Portal (they don't seem to show up on any OTAs like hotels.com or expedia.com). So I can't seem to use my UR for that either.

I'm going to be coming back to NYC via London, and there's a great nonstop fare of ~$250 from London to NYC on Primera Air, including baggage. But, AGAIN, Primera Air can't booked from the UR Travel Portal and the phone agents can't locate the flight either.

In sum, I have 600k UR points but I can't seem to find a way to make good use of them. If I transferred UR to Avios, I'd be hit with massive fuel surcharges and taxes flying BA or Virgin Atlantic to/from Manchester or London. And even something like United, with no fuel charges, if there's even award availability- why should I transfer 30k UR to United when I can get cash fares for $250 each way?

I've done a lot of research, so I'm not sure if anyone is able to help me here. This may just be a rant post. I know that mileage redemptions aren't great in economy (particularly to Europe) with cash fares so low- that's when people recommend booking low cash fares via the UR Travel Portal with 1.5cpp. But when those cash fares aren't available on the UR Travel Portal, what am I supposed to do? If the only fares that are bookable at 1.5cpp via the portal are expensive legacy carriers (like United and Virgin Atlantic want $1,000-$1,500 for the same flights), then 1.5cpp is a bunch of garbage IMO, because I'm not going to spend those prices."

Business class is preferred throughout but don't mind doing some legs in economy. Be prepared for me to be overanalyzing everything here...

Trip 1. This summer to Europe from PHL (ideally) although any NYC airport is doable. Been looking at Nice and Amalfi Coast August 3-August 12 roughly. Considering burning AA for this but from everything I'm reading it seems like AA business class isn't a great product so maybe I'd be better served flying on a Star Alliance airline?

Trip 2. Honeymoon next summer to Hawaii and Japan. Could I pull this off on ANA? I keep reading that ANA has to be RT which wouldn't work if we flew into Tokyo from US and then back from Hawaii. If this is doable on ANA then maybe I burn AA to Europe and save United miles for the honeymoon. If I should be looking at Cathay for the Japan trip then maybe I should be saving my AA and burning different points to Europe. Is finding biz to Japan on any airline in late June 2019 going to be a needle in a haystack?

In terms of points, I have 600K AA, 200K United assuming I can combine with my SO, 600K UR, 435K MR. If there's some great redemption I'm missing here for either of these trips and I should be digging into some of the UR/MR, I'm all ears. I would like to start burning some of these AA points one way or another though.

Alright, I think that covers it...sorry for the long rambling complicated post. TIA for any and all help

EDIT: Alright I put a ""Hold"" for 2 passengers on:

The talks, which are at a preliminary stage, would see Emirates acquire the main airline business of Abu Dhabi?s Etihad, which would keep its maintenance arm, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. The negotiations could yet fall through, they said.

Both airlines initially declined to comment, before later denying that any talks were underway. Were a transaction to go ahead the enlarged airline operation would be bigger than that of [American Airlines Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAL:US), which has a market value of $19.2 billion.

Any deal would require the blessing of the rulers of the richest sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates. For Abu Dhabi, which sits on 6 percent of global oil reserves, it would advance a drive to overhaul state-controlled entities as it adapts to lower crude prices. The airlines have traditionally been arch rivals, with their hubs competing to attract the same transfer passengers making long-distance trips between Asia and the West.""

"2016-03-10 16:00:58"|"Overview of Getting to Europe Using Amex MRs"|"I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I'm going to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex?s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The ?high season? is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 ?high season? will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The ?low season? is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the ?low season? and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the ?high season?. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the ?low season? and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the ?high season?.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe ? especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific?s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions ? Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore?s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic?s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al?s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al?s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (?WS?) is January 1 ? March 24 and November 1 ? December 31, while the Summer Season (?SS?) is March 25 ? October 31.  El Al?s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan ? from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!"
"2017-05-09 14:46:19"|"[award advice] MLE -> JFK Honeymoon Return Flight"|"I had been tracking a return trip on Turkish Airlines business class through United, waiting for my points to post at the end of my Chase statement. This morning, the first leg of the trip (8h40m) is no longer available in business, and I'd have to split my trip between economy and business. There are no other all-business flights going out that day (+/- 1 day).

It's a honeymoon return flight, so it's pretty far in advance (3/9/18). Need two tickets (goes without saying -- easy to find one seat).

Any chance additional award space will open on a flight out of MLE if I wait it out, or should I bite the bullet and go for the econ/bus return flight that's available? My understanding is Turkish has a pretty good economy product, though ~9hrs is tough.

For reference, I'm booking purely UR flights. United is 80k pp business, and Turkish is Star Alliance partner.

At end of statement (~5/15/17), I will have 195k UR (right now have 145k)."
"2019-05-12 02:30:01"|"Overall strategy for business traveler?"|"I?m looking for some advice. I?ve been a regular business traveler for a number of years and I?ve mostly just stuck to one airline and its partners, accrued miles, and has one card to earn extra points. Learning more about serious award travel experts, it seems like I might not be optimizing my point accumulation but I?m not totally sure how to do better. 

I see lots of people racking up lots of different points via cards and then transferring as needed, but it seems that for me such a strategy would mean missing out on all the points I earn through flying. But sticking to one FF program means less accrual and less than ideal redemptions. 

Are there tools or calculators or guides for figuring all this out?

Specifically, I typically fly 3-4 paid J international trips each year and another 4-5 domestic Y transcons. So on United that roughly gets me maybe 250k miles per year (maybe a bit more depending on fares). I also have a Chase Sapphire Preferred card so I get some points there but not as much as I get from flying. Typically I just end up moving my chase points into the united account to top up when I don?t have enough points for a redemption. But I suspect that isn?t ideal. On the other hand, I?m not sure it is really worth going after lots of various points given how much I?m tied to United via flying. 

So what do folks here do? What?s the right strategy for someone like me? What are the questions I should be asking?"

For some reason flyer talk has pages and pages of people saying this isn?t possible as recently as December.  Very easy process.

Edit2: [This is the thread that started my confusion.](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/united-airlines-mileageplus/1598532-no-swiss-advance-economy-seat-selection-united-ticket-stock-5.html) And I now know why I mixed this up. Apparently Swiss can?t give you an assigned seat if it?s a code share. I thought code share meant a booking on Swiss Air through a partner. It actually means one booking using 2 airlines for different defendants. Probably well known around these parts but I just sorted it out. Thanks guys. 

I was about to book a United award flight which would use either Swiss Air or Lufthansa back from Europe. I was just reading that those airlines won't let partner award travelers select seats beforehand. You apparently cant even pay the extra fee they normally charge paid ticketed passengers if you wanted to. They say you'll get your seat assignments at the gate.

Well how does this actually work out? We're a group of 4 and will be traveling with a child. I'm sure each airline is different, but in general do they just screw you over and stick everyone apart? Do they try and work everyone in? Do they at least keep a parent and child together? "

"2019-05-04 22:15:07"|"Advice needed on mileage use for first business class trip"|"Hello,

I am hoping to get some guidance on how best to use mileage to book a mixed class fare in 2020 and get the best value. I decided it would be nice to book a business class fare for the first time ever because I never sleep on flights and thought a lie-flat seat could finally allow me to sleep. So here?s where I?m hoping to get some expert advice on how to get the most out of this. Here?s my situation:

*I?ve got 70k Chase Rewards, and 15k United
*I will likely accumulate 30k more Chase miles over the next year
*So I would likely eventually only have enough miles to do business class there and then would need do economy back
*Direct flights a plus, and would be flying out of Chicago
*Only looking at travel to Europe or Asia

I?ve done a lot of research, but still don?t feel very informed about best business class product in Europe or Asia. I know Middle Eastern airlines have a great product, but I do not have a desire to travel to those destinations. So this is where I?m having an issue making a decision about how to best use miles. It seems United or ANA may be a good way to do a business class fare to Japan and then economy back. With the excursionist perk flight, that?d be 115k for business there and economy back. Is there a better option for travel to Asia?  

How about European business travel? United business class seems to get mixed reviews. Swiss appears to have good marks, but don?t know if I would be better off with a different airline. Any other stand outs?

To be honest, I want to maximize my choice, but even with the research I?m doing, I don?t feel like I have a grasp of the best avenue forward. So what I?m basically asking is as follows:  if I will eventually have 100k Chase Rewards and 15k United miles, what?s the best spend to get a business class there and then economy back in Europe or Asia?  It seems like staying with Star Alliance is a good idea, but I?m sure I?m not considering other ideas. Any guidance I could get would be most helpful. Thanks!"

Thoughts on transferring or other options?"|"I'm getting married this October and got a credit card last year to pay for expenses and earn miles for our honeymoon. I was kinda clueless and didn't do great research, but my parents had a United MileagePlus card so I got one. Now, though, I'm realizing that A) apparently United sucks as an airline, and B) the cost of a flight to our honeymoon destination (Nicaragua) would be cheaper on other airlines even WITH the miles we've accumulated (49k). Now I'm kinda thinking I should just ditch this card and get a Southwest card since we do a ton of US travel and San Diego is a huge hub of theirs, or a Costco AMEX since I've heard great things about them, or I don't know - some other card I don't know about. 

Anyone experienced miles users have any tips for changing cards? Can I just buy out my balance? How does that work? Any suggestions?"

"2019-01-01 17:16:29"|"ANA RTW Planning: Back Tracking in Asia Zones"|"Hi everyone! Happy New Years! I first would like to say I am fairly new to Reddit community so please bear with me...

I am graduating from college in March 2020 and am planning to leave for RTW trip with my girlfriend, who is likely to be engaged to me by then. I have been in this game for about two years and I have read many RTW reports previously. I am hoping to finish booking RTW by April..

&#x200B;

The routes I am planning are as following:

1. SFO - NRT (ANA)
2. NRT - BKK (Thai;ANA)
3. BKK - TPE (Thai;EVA)
4. TPE - ICN(Thai;EVA;OZ)
5. ICN - IST (OZ)
6. IST - BCN(Turkish)
7. BCN - FRA (LH)
8. FRA - ORD/EWR (UA;??)

As far as my planning goes, the total distance is less than 22,000 miles, which should cost MR 125K per person. The tax and other fees I estimated through IATA came out to be around $700-- doable, but would be great if I could cut else where.

&#x200B;

The issue I am concerned here is backtracking. ANA distinguishes Zone 1: Japan, Zone 2: Korea, Zone 3: Taiwan, Zone 4: Thailand, Zone 6: United States, and Zone 7: Europe. Thus, my routing goes zone 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7. I have seen few data points where the backtracking in a certain region (e.x. Asia, Europe) was allowed. While ANA does not have an official rule for backtracking for RTW, it does have a rule for award redemption for based zones: [https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/tk/zone.html](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/tk/zone.html)

&#x200B;

So I was hoping to see more data points if anyone had an experience or issue in regards to this. I also wanted to hear some suggestion for the last leg (Europe - USA) since I was barely able to find saver availability on UA. If you know any good airline with least fuel surcharge, please share it with me!

&#x200B;

Again, I apologize in advance. This is my first post on Reddit. Happy New Years everyone!

United just called me and it's less than 1 week away from my vacation travels for this flight... very short notice. Part of my flight is going from Naples (Italy) to Nevsehir (Turkey) about a week and a half into my vacation and now one of their partnered airlines (Turkish Airlines) is (I think) cancelling their flight from IST to NAV and the next best flight to Nevsehir (NAV) is 2 days later than my planned trip. I used my miles for this flight and so United is calling me what I want to do.

I have booked all my hotels and tours and did a lot of planning but now our plans require us to re-book everything and at a much more expensive last minute rate. Is there something I can do here? Like some way United can compensate for this kind of inconvenience?

Thanks in advance!

&#x200B;

Edit: Jeez this was such a time waster and mentally exhausting process... spent over 2 hours on the phone with 3 different customer rep, 1 dropped call, 2 transfers, and finally got to a supervisor that ended up resolving my crisis.  This was an eye opener for me, turns out with flights like these that are booked through United Rewards but flight is operated by another airline, United Airlines doesn't have much power.  I went with the NAP -> ASR route since that seemed the least impact to my schedule change. The supervisor called Turkish Airlines and needed Turkish Airlines to convert those economy seat into a mileage rewards seats or else United cannot use it but Turkish Airlines wouldn't budge even though it was their fault for a schedule change AND they had economy seats open for the NAP -> ASR. She tried a few other options and airports but it was either not available at all for miles or it was a huge change in schedule. The only option I was left with was to do business class upgrade for NAP -> ASR for 10k miles, I had to transfer my Chase points. I pressured the supervisor a bit more and was able to get a $100 voucher. All in all, I still need to make some changes due to change in airports but at least my schedule did not get impacted but it also costed me an extra 10,000 miles."

So after a lot of talk on here and reading other forums, looks like the best possibility of using these Alaska Miles is to look for availability starting 2 weeks before the departure.

This got me thinking about a possible solution.

I have enough UR points to book 2 one way business class tickets via United (about 90K points each) and reading  United's site I can get these points re-deposited if I cancel less than 60 days from the departure for a $125 free for each ticket. 

Does this sound like a good game plan? 

Also, United has this rule ""Fee for booking a MileagePlus award ticket through any channel, less than 21 days before departure"" That fee is $75 for ticket. 

Right now, I'm just super frustrated I have these Alaska Miles and can't find good award availability with Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines. "

I live in mount vernon triangle area in DC and travel domestically for work.  I currently fly United and most of the time have to travel to Dulles. I started with United because Marriott gave me silver status and knew they occasionally fly out of DCA and have the United Hub in Dulles. 

I don?t mind taking an Uber to Dulles and or BWI if flights are direct and prefer that to connecting flights out of dca. I would love to find an airline that flys out of DCA more that isn?t American since my experiences with them are usually poor there. 

I have flown ~30,000 miles this year and am on track to hit United Gold. I wasn?t sure if this is worth much flying out of a hub like Dulles where it seems everyone is 1k / Platinum. 

I have a girlfriend who would benefit from the companion pass in Southwest if I could hit that and haven?t opened any of the credit cards with them either. 

So my main question is should I keep flying with United or do people living in DC prefer Southwest?"

"2019-07-13 20:11:47"|"Will United status match if I was given American Airlines status as a promo offer?"|"About a month ago, I got an e-mail from AA saying they were offering me free gold status through the end of September. They offered a lower threshold of EQM/EQD to retain gold through 2021 as well. However, I don't usually fly or have many miles on AA. I take them out of convenience sometimes for work (since I live near DCA) but I've tended to accrue and fly more on United over the years. However, I'm not ~ quite ~ a frequent flyer enough on United to hit silver. I have almost triple the number of miles on United than American and I tend to care more about mile accrual to use one day for a trip (have about 30K now) than upgrades, priority stuff, etc. 


I read on United's website they will status match with AA Gold to United Silver. Will United match my current American gold status even though it is was given as part of a promotion?


I think I could potentially hit silver on United regardless of the status match, but it would require flying a bit more out of my way on a few trips and I haven't confirmed enough trips for the rest of the year to where I would definitely hit silver, so trying for a status match would make life easier. I know with the status match, for silver, you do have to hit a certain amount of miles with United within 90 days (I think 8 EQD or 8,000 EQM) which is not a problem as I have four confirmed work trips in the next three months, two of which are east coast to west coast and one international so that is certainly attainable.

"2019-04-10 08:26:10"|"Honeymoon flights finally booked - IAH-DPS (BALI) JAN 2020"|"After a few days of pain, I finally finished all my award books for my honeymoon flights next Jan 2020.

&#x200B;

Here is what I got.

IAH-SIN-DPS for 99k Krisflyer miles each on Singapore Air business class - transferred from UR

DPS-SIN 7.5k krisflyer miles each on Singapore Air Economy (stopover in SIN for two days to stay at Marina Bay Sands hotel)

SIN-BKK-TPE-YVR 90 United miles each 2 Thai Airways business class, then EVA Air business class from TPE-YVRYVR-IAH 12.5k Krisflyer miles each on Air Canada and United

&#x200B;

A total of 209k miles each.

&#x200B;

My original plan for these flights was to use the excursionist perk to book IAH-DPS stopover in SIN then fly back to IAH for 180k round trip, but things didn't work out as planned.

&#x200B;

Issue 1 -  Not being able to book Singapore air award flights on United - this happened in January of this year and is an ongoing issue today. This killed my plans b/c a direct flight from DPS-SIN via Singapore air should be 2hr 40min, but the only available way now is through BKK and a 19hr flightThis caused me to transfer my UR points to Kris Flyer and book the first leg of the trip via Singapore airlines.

&#x200B;

Issue 2 - Fiancee signed up for the United Explorer business card and received a 75k bonus on United. So we were basically forced to use them to book our return flight. I had many issues finding a business saver ticket on United (90k points each). I eventually found a flight with Eva through TPE and booked it but it wouldn't go through. After many hrs on the phone, it turns out United's website for award booking is not very accurate and there were no award bookings left for the flight I booked.

&#x200B;

This happened 3 other times - I call United, confirm availability on business class for 2 people on my days (gave a 3-day window), book online and the bookings kept on being unconfirmed. There was literally no available flights from SIN (or BKK or TPE) back to IAH with a Business Saver Award. I thought I was doomed since I now had 180k points stuck on United.

&#x200B;

Luckily I found a flight SIN-BKK-TPE-YVR (Vancouver) that was all business class flights and it actually went through (I was shocked). I had to spend an additional 12.5k per person to get from YVR-IAH the next day but I said fck it and was just relieved we can actually go on this trip now.

&#x200B;

Lesson learned - Always call and confirm award availability (esp for Business class) via partner airlines (call the actual partner airline and the airline you are booking through).

&#x200B;

Now the fun part - booking hotels and planning our trip - we will spend 8 full days in Bali, 2 full days in Singapore, 1 day in Vancouver, and about 2.5 days in transit."

So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Citi TYPs***

Citi offers a few cards that earn ThankYou Points, including their ThankYou Premier card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for travel and gas). Citi offers a few other card options that earn TYPs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Citi?s website and check out the options.

Your TYPs will transfer to 12 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your TYPs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since Cathay Pacific operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be lower than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. FlyingBlue is definitely going to be your best option for a SkyTeam partner redemption and is a good choice in general for a coach redemption ? though unless you are dead set on flying a SkyTeam partner airline, it is not going to be your best bet for a premium cabin redemption. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Garuda Indonesia**

Garuda Indonesia?s GarudaMiles program uses a distance based award chart, so your redemption cost will depend on your home airport. Garuda Indonesia is part of the SkyTeam alliance which means you can redeem your GarudaMiles for Air France, KLM, Alitalia, Delta, Czech Airlines or Garuda Indonesia (on their 5th freedom route from Amsterdam (AMS) to London (LGW)) flights.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~75k miles for coach and ~135k miles for business class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~85k miles for coach and ~150k miles for business class.

Although the redemption rates may not be horrible, the process for obtaining your award ticket is probably the worst I have ever seen. First you need to call the Garuda Indonesia call center at 021.2351.9999 to place your award ticket on hold. Then you need to download and complete an award ticket application form which you must take to a Garuda Indonesia sales office, in person, and then go back to the ticket office, in person, to claim your award ticket. So how many sales offices does Garuda Indonesia have in the US? Four. Yes, you read that right. Four. Encino, California, Chicago, Houston and New York.

In short, avoid Garuda Indonesia like the plague for award tickets unless you happen to live in or very near Encino, Chicago, Houston or New York and do not mind doing a ton of legwork.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific?s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your TYPs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Malaysia Airlines**

Malaysia Airlines? Enrich program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Malaysia Airlines is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Enrich miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~54k miles roundtrip for coach, ~96k miles roundtrip for business class and ~132k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~72k miles roundtrip for coach, ~132k miles roundtrip for business class and ~192k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

While the redemption rates are actually generally not horrible, there have been a lot of reports of people experiencing issues when transferring their TYPs to the Enrich program. I would generally steer clear of transferring your TYPs to the Enrich program until Malaysia Airlines gets their IT department up to speed and fixes these issues.

**Qantas**

Qantas? Frequent Flyer program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qantas is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe. Qantas also partners with Aer Lingus, so you can also fly them on a partner award ticket!

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~70k miles roundtrip for coach, 105k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~130k miles roundtrip for business class and ~190k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~84k miles roundtrip for coach, ~126k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~156k miles roundtrip for business class and ~228k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Remember that you will be charged for carrier imposed surcharges, which means avoid British Airways and Iberia flights for the trans-Atlantic segment if you can!

Qantas? redemption costs are fairly high, so unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qantas miles that you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe as the Qantas redemptions rates are not very good.

**Qatar**

Qatar?s Qmiles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qatar is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~75k miles roundtrip for coach, ~112.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~150k miles roundtrip for business class and ~225k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip for coach, ~127.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~170k miles roundtrip for business class and ~255k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Again, and as with Qantas, unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qmiles you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe.

**EVA Air**

EVA Air is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Infinity miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 68k miles for coach, 105k miles for business class and 170k miles for first class.

EVA Air requires that you make your Star Alliance award ticket booking through their reservation office. With that said, considering that Singapore Airlines has access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that EVA Air has, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines for a coach or first class redemption. If you are looking for a business class award ticket, you are better off transferring your TYPs to EVA instead of Singapore Airlines.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore?s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Thai Airways**

Thai Airways is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Royal Orchid Plus miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 70k miles for coach, 125k miles for business class and 160k miles for first class.

Keep in mind that Thai Airways charges fuel surcharges as well on award tickets, and from all reports I have seen, they are exorbitant. Considering that Singapore Airlines and EVA should both have access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that Thai Airways has access to, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines or EVA (if you want a business class award ticket) for this redemption unless you have a huge stash of Royal Orchid Plus miles that you are looking to burn and you do not mind paying exorbitant surcharges.

**Etihad**

Although Etihad is not a part of any major airline alliance, they do have several strategic partnerships with airlines such as Air Berlin, Alitalia, Czech Airlines and Brussels Airlines. Unfortunately, you are not able to redeem your Guest Miles for award tickets on these airlines. Etihad?s Guest Miles program is a dynamic program that has so many variables in its pricing structure that I could not possibly address all the possibilities here. I would instead recommend that you go to their mileage calculator and plug in your information to determine your mileage redemption rates.

For reference though, most of your flights are going to run well over 100k miles for a coach award ticket, so I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere to transfer your TYPs for a European trip.

u/workthrowaway323 pointed out (thanks!) that you can actually book AA saver level award flights with your Guest Miles. Like AA, Etihad uses a peak/off peak system for economy award tickets. Off-peak dates between the U.S. and Europe are October 15 - May 15. Roundtrip economy redemptions will cost you 40k miles off-peak and 60k miles during peak times, while business class will cost 100k miles and first class will cost 125k miles. To redeem you have to contact the Etihad service center at 888-8ETIHAD ***at least 14 days prior to the intended date of travel***. 

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are quite good, it is important to remember that your TYPs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of TYPs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the second worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your TYPs!"

Within United, we can fly Fort Wayne, IN, US (FWA) to Rome, IT (FCO) for either 30K points in Econ or 70K points in Bus.  The Econ trip duration is 17 hours and the Bus flight duration is 19.5 hours.

Would you guys book the Bus or Econ flight?

"2019-07-30 03:10:11"|"Need advice! Ticket booked under wife's married name but passport has maiden name"|" 

Hello all,

My wife and I are flying to South Korea to visit her parents and I booked 2 award tickets.

One on Korean Air going to Seoul and one on Asiana using UA miles going back to LAX.

As the subject says, I mistakenly put my wife's married name on the ticket for the return flight on Asiana but her passport is still in her maiden name.

I've called both United and Asiana and they keep telling me to call the other airlines but won't change the name on the ticket.

My question is, in your experience, was it difficult to have the agent at the ticket counter change the name to match the passport? Specifically at Incheon if anyone else has had this problem.

I've been reading that people bring their marriage certificate and ID or in my wife's case her green card, and they haven't had any issues getting the name changed when checking in.

I've talked to United and they've added a note to her ticket stating that the boarding pass should be changed to her maiden name as well but I'd rather have some piece of mind.

I was thinking about going to the airport early to check in and showing them all the appropriate documents and asking them to change it there and if worse comes to worse calling United to confirm that the name change has been requested and see if they'd listen to United.

I would cancel the ticket and rebook and change the name but there is no more availability left on the reward tickets and I don't want to risk cancelling and then not having it show up again.

Also, we wouldn't be able to change her name on the passport because our flight going to Korea is under her maiden name.

Thanks for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"2018-09-18 22:54:56"|"Booking an award flight to Athens"|"Well, it is time to book my first award flight!

&#x200B;

I did a little bit of research and decided to look for award flights to Athens.

&#x200B;

Since award flights out of IAH were not available, I decided to do some searches out of airports on the eastern side of the country. Using RR points, I will take a flight to the east coast from Houston.

&#x200B;

I do have a few questions for the more experienced individuals. Here are my searches, point costs, and questions:

&#x200B;

American Airlines

There is plenty of Business and First class availability for the date range we plan to go. 57,500 points each way via Business/First MilesAAver and 85,000 points each way via First MileSAAver.

* What is the difference between the two type of redemptions?
* Aircraft types are 744, 320, and 777 with American Airlines and British Airways. That being said, is there any preference in between the three aircraft types?
* To book, I would transfer my UR to British Avios, then call British Airways to book the flights using flight number and dates, correct? Would the point costs in ""British Avios"" be the same as the AA points I see on the AA website?
* Anything else I need to look for if booking thru AA?

&#x200B;

Alaska Airlines

* No availability, was hoping to find something with Emirates and fees with ""Partner Airlines"" were too high.

United

Some of availability, a few Business Saver Awards within the date ranges we are looking for (+/- 2 days, a little flexibility). Costs are 70,000 points each way.

* Availability are flights operated by Austrian, SWISS, and Aegan. Is there any preference or experiences within these two airlines?
* Sadly, no Lufthanasa availability.
* Any other airlines to look into within the United umbrella?
* Anything else I need to look for if booking thru United?

&#x200B;

Out of the options available, which would you pick and why?

Any other suggestions?

&#x200B;

Thank you!

"2016-10-15 08:16:11"|"[award advice] Planning ahead for Europe late 2017 with UR"|"I'm trying to plan my honeymoon for late next year to Europe, and I wanted to run it by you guys to make sure I'm not overlooking anything in my research. 

* We will have around 300k UR to spend on this trip for 2 passengers.
* We are based out of LAX.
* Targeting Italy as the primary destination, possibly with a stopover in a 2nd nearby country.
* Targeting lie-flat J class seats at least to Europe, and ideally back as well.
* Aim to minimize surcharges, thus currently targeting transfer to United for *A bookings.
* Currently thinking ~2 week trip, with at least 1 week in Italy.
* Dates are flexible, but targeting late next year (perhaps October?) to try and optimize availability and aim for shoulder season, but still have plenty of daylight hours and nice weather.


Skypass would only cost 160k RT for J class, but I didn't see any fuel surcharges under $400 per person for any of the airlines with nice lie-flat seats. Since United doesn't pass on fuel surcharges, I'm currrently targeting them. However, searching for availability is an issue.


Let's assume that FCO is my destination. Since I don't believe Star Alliance has an airline that flies direct from LAX, I'm thinking of taking advantage of the fact that they *don't* fly direct and instead stopover in another country for several days. From my research, the following seem to be my options:


* Turkish Airlines, stopover in Istanbul. Not sure how safe it would be to spend time in Turkey.
* Austrian Airlines, stopover in Vienna.
* Lufthansa, stopover in Munich/Frankfurt.
* Swiss Air, stopover in Zurich.
* SAS, stopover in Stockholm. I've never seen availability for this.


Am I missing anything here? With the recent United routing changes, the number of unique routes seems to have shrunk, but it's possible I'm overlooking something. That being said, I'm currently thinking Austrian will be our best bet, since it seems to have good availability when I search as far out as possible (currently August and September 2017) and Vienna seems like a good place to visit. Austrian also seems to have a good J product from what I've read.


For the return trip, Turkish seems to have good availability, and we could do a short layover in IST to check out the Turkish business lounge which I've heard is great. Additionally Turkish seems to have a great J product.


A final thought is the realization that 2 RT J class flights to Europe will cost 280k UR via United, which won't leave many points left for any hotel bookings. I've read that Hyatt is the best redemption for UR, but it also doesn't seem like there's more than 1 or 2 Hyatt's per country, and usually they're high end ones at that (PH Milan, PH Vienna, etc.). Should I be trying to obtain more UR for transfers to Marriot? Opening a Marriot/SPG card for Marriot/SPG points? We are also considering paying cash for airbnbs.


Please let me know if I have overlooked anything. Additionally, any personal experiences flying these products are welcome...though it doesn't look like I have a lot of options beyond the ones I've mentioned in terms of minimizing fuel surcharges and actual award availability. Thank you in advance!"
"2018-01-14 17:52:11"|"YVR - EZE/SCL that doesn't suck? (aeroplan/alaska)"|"Hi folks! Hoping to plan my trip for next Christmas using points, but I'm seeing pretty crappy deals and hoping one of you might give me some guidance. 


Here are the basics:

My partner and I both signed up for the Alaska MBNA card, so I have ~30k points and she has ~25k points. We're both going to be stocking up on Aeroplan points this year, and I've got about 100k worth in amex right now (ready for 1:1 transfer to aeroplan). We'll sign up for whatever cards we need to get us enough points to make the trip (assume that we'll have the points). We would prefer to fly business, but can also do economy.


We're hoping to fly to either EZE or SCL (Buenos Aires or Santiago, Chile) around December 14th (flexible) and return 3 weeks later from the opposite airport. We're also open to travelling out of Seattle if that makes things substantially easier.


Here's what I'm finding so far:

Alaska: all reward flights seem to have gone up to 57.5k, with none of the 30k flights available after Nov 12. Do they not offer anything in economy closer to xmas? It's a shame since Alaska charges next-to-nothing in taxes.


Aeroplan: typical, flights are available but taxes are insane. The routes I've found to and from each city are all AC flights and taxes range from $380pp/flight, leading to a total cost of $1600 in taxes. I can buy market rate for ~$2100, so it's a shit deal.


Any suggestions here, fine folks? I've read up on researching different legs on different airlines, but not sure which websites to use for this. I tried united, but didn't get anywhere.


Here are the options I've found so far: https://imgur.com/a/wAZX9

"2018-01-02 21:19:12"|"What useful award booking knowledge did you learn last year?"|"It is the start of a new year, hopefully everyone used all their miles and had awesome trips last year. I am listing a couple of useful tips that I have found helpful over the year. Please add something you have found helpful while booking award travel. 

1. If you can't find good flights out of your home city search from cities with international flights.  Often times programs like United show you different results based on your search city. Even if you fly out of LAX you might find a lot more availability out of Houston. Some programs like United don't allow you to ""customize"" your routing, but you can add an additional flight for the price of the flight. 

2. Look at the airline you want to fly route map. I have found J availability to Tokyo from San Jose when all the other cities ANA flies to had no availability. I found Christmas time LATAM J flights to Santiago from Orlando when there was not availability from any other city. 

3. When booking Southwest/refundable flights book them as one ways and check google flights 48-24h before your flight to see if cash fares on other airlines have decreased (I cancelled a $135 Southwest ticket for a $27 AA ticket today). Also periodically check to see of the Southwest fare has decreased. 

4. Be aware of phantom availability. Just because you see a flight as bookable online doesn't mean that the award space actually exists.
 
5. When searching for award availability be aware that all partners don't get the same award availability and use multiple sources. I was searching for Fiji availability and the easiest way to find it was with Alaska's search tool. I also used expert flyer which showed space that wasn't bookable on Alaska, but was bookable on American Airlines. 

6. Just because there are rules doesn't mean that they are always followed. I have found Singapore long haul 777er routes with partner availability, I have had AA change the arrival city of an award ticket for free, I have had AA cancel a paid ticket 48 hours after booking for free, I have been upgraded to club level access when it is specifically not allowed.

&#x200B;

I?m not as familiar with Delta, VS or AF, so not sure if I?m missing any obvious routes from those partners?

Personally, I think the best route would be Qantas (any feedback on J v F?) and then ANA (takes a little longer through this route)

What are your experiences with Qantas F and J?

Is it as simple as finding availability on Qantas as far out as possible and then book via AA?

Did I miss an obvious route?

Let me know your feedback!"
"2018-02-18 05:25:49"|"[Award Advice] NYC to Bangkok in Biz/First"|"Hi, I'm looking to book an award Apr 5-16 for myself (1) from NYC to BKK in J or F. Have a 1-2 days of flexibility on departure and return if needed but would like to stick to those dates if possible.

**Balances:**
Singapore Krisflyer 110,000 (Expires Jan 24, 2019)

Aeroplan 142,107

AA 87,565

BA Avios 53,701

Delta 105,346

United 6,145

(Have UR and SPG to supplement if needed but want to use my airline miles I have now)

**Departure Plan Apr 5 NYC-BKK:**

**Avail:** AA award for CX JFK-HKG-BKK Y

**Desired:** Upgrade to JAL(Preferred) or CX hoping for close-in avail to open up for 70k AA.

**Return Apr 16 BKK-NYC:**

**Avail:** Thai-Asiana BKK-ICN-JFK on Krisflyer 97.5k.

**Desired:**

*Option 1:* Again hope for close-in avails to open up on EVA BKK-TPE-JFK or ANA BKK-NRT/HND-JFK

*Option 2:* Thai / Lufthansa BKK-FRA-JFK for 112.5k in F (close-in avail)

* Debating option 2 as Thai/LH F experiences are really well-reviewed. But the extra 12.5k points is enough for a shorthaul NA worth about $100-200 and have to pay $300-400 in surcharges I think for LH... Is it worth it? I know it's subjective... CX/JAL I've flown in F and while it was cool, wouldn't normally spend more points to go F over J on those airlines.

**Thoughts/Questions**

* I'm trying to reduce the random buckets of points I have. I'm trying to use AA (as there's no other way for me to use those) and Krisflyer as it has the hard expiry. But would welcome suggestions if I really should be using something else.

* I'm really familiar with last-min avails on AA with CX/JAL and feel pretty good about finding something within 2 weeks. But I'm not familiar at all with last-min on the * Alliance - EVA/ANA/LH/Thai. Is it the same as CX/JAL? Am I likely to be able to find F avail on LH/Thai or barring that ANA/EVA on J getting closer to departure? How soon should I be looking? Ideally I'm not trying to search avails during the trip.

* If I did choose to go F, I'd normally book the ""better"" cabin experience at the departure, not the return but I'm reading a big part of the appeal of Thai F is the lounge/departure services so I've put that on the return end.

* Noting also that Songkran is Apr 13-15 so I don't know if returning Apr 16 is going to be tougher to find avails.

* I've travelled on CX/JAL but not the other airlines mentioned but appreciate any tips, thoughts on the itinerary, airlines I'm picking, or anything else would be appreciated!"
"2019-08-18 23:57:15"|"Is there a Chase Transfer Partner Other than United That Flies U.S to Australia?"|"I'm considering a trip to Australia next year and I have 90k Chase Points but in the Chase Portal most flights are like 95k points. I'll probably accrue that many points by the time I'm ready to book (waiting on a potential job offer before I can book) but I've also heard booking through the Chase Portal usually sucks.  


I see the airline partners with Chase and I'm bummed my favorite airline (Delta) is not on there but my least favorite (United) is. I'm not 100% against United but I really do not want to fly with them. Are there loopholes with the other transfer partners where you can transfer to them and book a codeshare ticket to Australia? I'd be flying PHX-SYD and back probably in February but I can most likely do the trip anytime throughout the year (I'm fine with off season travel). My main post ends here the paragraph below is just extra useless information in case any of you are interested.  


I don't like United because I flew them from FRA-IAH once and the flight was subpar as well as I took them from PHX-MSP and back via ORD and my butt started hurting an hour into the flight. And I love flying. I'm weird and I actually enjoy commercial air travel so most annoyances don't bother me so if I don't like an airline then it's got to be bad lol. Also I am willing to give United another shot because I haven't flown with them in 3 years so maybe they've improved? If you've flown on the United 787 recently (that's mostly what they fly to Australia) in economy then let me know if it was hell or not."

"2016-08-28 16:30:33"|"My first award trip - book before 10/6"|"Hello,

This is my first post so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong. (Edit: took me 10 min to get sub bullets to work haha)

I have the following points and trip ideas and could use some advice.

**Points:**

UR - 89k
United - 106k me (SO has 23k)
Delta - 25k

**Ideas:**
Both leaving from PHL, NYC, DC or other regional airports 

New Zealand + Australia (+ an island, Bora Bora etc)
China (Xi'an at least) + ??? (Europe, Japan, SE Asia)

**Constraints:**

- so any multi week trip has to be after June 17th 2017 (maybe the 13th if we bet on having no snow make up days tacked on)
- singe weeks are available: April 8-17, Feb 11-20 or Feb 17-26, Dec 23-jan 2, Nov 19-28. Could use two with a delayed stopover
- I want to maximise point value while taking advantage of the soon to be eliminated united rules.
- I will be getting more points in the future so will be doing both trips.
- I don't mind paying for a few legs in cash if that makes sense 
- my SO is getting over her fear of flying to i want to stay away from budget airlines and all but the best SE Asia airlines. Not sure about China airlines. Would like to fly direct to Xi'an with united.

**My thoughts on options:**

* New Zealand trip - 2+ weeks in June/July/August 
PHL-->AKL (stopover) --> SYD
SYD --> island?? (Stopover) --> PHL 
  * I know it's winter but 50's and 60's in AKL don't sound too bad. Colder at higher elevations. Thoughts?
  * 5-7 days in NZ, 3 days on the island and net in AUS?
  * as for the island I know french Polynesia is tough with united so I'd be willing to pay cash or use UR points some other way to get there from AKL or SYD.
  * any ideas on  using an open jaw to make this ttrip dea better?



* For  China trip - 2+ weeks in June/July/August 
PHL--> Japan/Thailand/Europe (stopover) --> Beijing 
Xi'an (open jaw) --> PHL (long stopover) --> anywhere? 
  * could reverse this trip
  * I have to be in Xi'an for 3-5 days to visit my SO's fam-jam but open after that
  * would take the high-speed train to or from Beijing 
  * stopover: want to max value here/do what makes sense given the rule change. As for Europe this may also help break up the long flight. Not sure of a Europe destination. Something that would be harder to hit on a future eurotrip.
  * as for the anywhere, open to ideas on places where one way returns are cheep or I could wait and use future points.



*  Last option is using the single weeks and delayed stopovers and maybe stand alone flights to split the trips up? I am kind of over my head on this one. Ideas?



Really appreciate the help!

Thank you"
"2019-10-12 13:48:38"|"Help requested: AS international award flight cancelled. What are my options?"|"My Japan Airlines flight from NRT to BOS booked via Alaska Airlines has been cancelled due to the ongoing typhoon. The Japan Airlines phone lines are not working so I'm not able to find out whether they're able to rebook me. I called Alaska and the CSR said that only they can rebook me but the first available flight to Boston is next Friday.

Has anyone else had any experience getting an earlier flight out? I'm also willing to go to SFO but on the website the first available flight is Thursday.

**Posting an update for everyone:** I called AS again to see if they're able to rebook me on a flight to SFO instead of BOS. After escalating to a supervisor who worked on award flights, the supervisor said they are not able to change destinations for me but was willing to make a one time exception provided seats were available. He looked through all JL seats for all west coast cities and even DFW for the next few days and only DFW was available on the Friday.

I continued to check award space for the next hour and a HND>SFO flight opened up for Thursday. I called AS again and after some discussion she said she couldn't change my flight to a different destination without the change fee but was willing to drop the cancel fee and have me rebook that flight myself.

I then looked around other carriers and luckily find an ANA flight to SFO via United for 35k + $100 in taxes for Wednesday so I went for that."
"2019-05-26 03:27:47"|"ANA RTW last minute cancel and rebook success story"|"In case it interests anyone, I thought it would be useful to share a data point where I was narrowly able to cancel and rebook a RTW for my wife and I about 100 hours before departure. 19,500 miles around the world in J.

It's pretty well known at this point that ANA offers incredible value, especially with the elusive RTW award. What makes the RTW especially tricky is that ANA's rules require saver availability on all flights to be open at the same time when you book. This may be obvious, but it is worth stating. Of course you can have some legs in Y, but you're paying for J, and isn't that the point?

In December we booked the following itinerary from 5/30 to 6/16 for 2 in J:

5/30: ATL-YYZ-YUL (AC)

5/31: YUL-PEK-HKT (CA)

6/7: HKT-BKK (TG)

6/9: BKK-BRU (TG)

6/16: DUB-YYZ (AC)

To me, this itinerary was always good but not great. Our first flight left at 6 am and we didn't get to Thailand until midnight. We also had a tight connection in PEK and had almost 20 hours on Air China. First world problems, I know, but I've heard mixed reviews about Air China's seat and service and that transiting PEK could be a nightmare. That being the case, I booked in December with the intention of rebooking down the road if the planets aligned and space opened up for a different routing.

Since December, I've maxed out the 200 alerts on ExpertFlyer and have been vigilantly watching all manner of different routings that would take us RTW with somewhat inflexible dates. It's worth noting that ANA award flights must be booked no later than 96 hours ahead of departure, which meant today was our last day to change for a May 29 evening departure. 


Drumroll...................it happened!!


After 6 months of virtually nothing opening up (*maybe* one or two possible routings came up, but they would have required a good bit of compromise) today finally was the day when J availability opened up enough for us to change. So we did. We are now flying:


5/29: ATL-ORD (UA)

5/30: ORD-HND (NH)

5/31: HND-BKK (TG) - intentionally long layover in BKK to check out the city for a bit and take a break from flying


5/31: BKK-HKT (TG)

6/7: HKT-BKK (TG)

6/8: BKK-AMS (BR !!)

[open jaw]

6/16: LHR-EWR (UA 767 new polaris)

6/16 EWR-ATL (cash on DL)


Overall I'm pretty ecstatic and just wanted to share with everyone. The total mileage was 115k and $600 per person with MR transferred to ANA. Surcharges on the rerouting went up a good bit because of returning to North America via London, but it was a tradeoff I was willing to make. 5x on Amex Platinum offsets that a bit too. And we now get to fly far superior airlines (especially EVA, the holy grail of J), try the new product on United, and get more time in Thailand. 

To cancel and rebook the ticket cost 3,000 miles per person which I had already transferred months ago in anticipation of cancelling and rebooking. I called in, fed the agent the dates and flight numbers, and went on hold a couple of times while she confirmed the space and calculated the taxes. Then she simultaneously cancelled and rebooked the flight. The mileage redeposit was instant. They saved the space, called back an hour later for me to pay the taxes, and then everything was ticketed instantly. 

I guess my message is that Star Alliance does have some decent last minute availability, especially ANA. So, if you're planning a RTW and you find a good-but-not-great itinerary, go ahead and book it to have *something* and then keep an eye out to rebook later--maybe even at the last minute like we did. I didn't even feel like there was any ""risk"" involved since the cancellation and rebooking was instantaneous after confirming everything was truly available. Of course this is all anecdotal, but I thought this sub would enjoy the data point on what has become a pretty popular award strategy. 

Thanks for reading my longest-ever self post and happy travels!"

My departure dates are any time between December 12-14, 2018.

I had my eyes on a Japan Airlines flight into San Diego bookable through Alaska Airlines only to have a warning message say the flights disappeared once I entered all our details and tried to pay. I called Alaska agents, they couldn't book it either, and Cathay Pacific award flights were almost non-existent except for a few Premium Economy seats (only 35,000 Alaska Miles, but it's only 50,000 for Cathay Business so seems like best not to book that).

Sooo, I have 130,000 Alaska Miles saved for this booking that looks like I can't use because of no availability on Japan Airlines or Cathay Pacific. 

I have about 500,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points I could use, but I really wanted to use the Alaska Miles.

Anyway, I really wanted business class all the way back to the states. Our final destination is Portland, but we don't mind spending the night somewhere and then taking Southwest flights (we have the companion pass) to Portland. 

I found a one way from Bangkok into San Jose, California for 90k United Miles on business class.

* Halifax - YHZ is about 3 1/2 hours drive from PEI

* United (25k RT)
* Avianca (25k RT)
* Singapore (25k RT)
* ANA (30k RT)
* Lufthansa (30k RT)
* EVA (39k RT)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

^^^^^.
For my specific situation:

**Available Currencies:**

* UR: 800k, MR: 700k, AA: 900k, TYP: 70k, CNB: 45k

**Ideal itinerary would be:** 

* 2 passengers in Y or J
 
*  7/14: DEN --> YHZ

* 7/19: YYG or YQM --> DEN

^^^^^.
I am looking to be in Halifax as early as possible on 7/14, to be able to drive up to Inverness and play golf at Cabot Links in the afternoon on 7/14 and Cabot Cliffs in the morning on 7/15.  Then driving/taking the ferry to PEI in the afternoon on 7/15.  Since YHZ is over 3 hours from the wedding location, ideally, we'd fly out of YYG or YQM on the way back.  So I'm looking for one-way or multi-city awards.

^^^^^.
I've looked extensively through Star Alliance partner sites (Aeroplan, United, Singapore, EVA, Avianca) and haven't come up with any great options for the return flight.

^^^^^.
**Outbound Options:**

Airline | Date | Departure City | Departure Time | Arrival City | Arrival Time | Layover City/Duration | Flight No | Cabin | Ticket Cost | Award Taxes | Award Miles | Miles from rev Flight | Cash Equivalent Flight | CPP | CPPCE

^^^^^.

**For the outbound flights, I have many good options.**  

Again, I'm looking for 2 people, and I don't want to be exhausted on 7/14/20, so spending 1:28 am til 6:45 am at Toronto's airport doesn't sound that appealing.  A positioning flight after work on 7/13, to either BOS or PHL using SW CP and then staying at hotel sounds like a much easier travel day.  The AA CPP is obviously inflated and a great redemption, but arriving at 14:00 vs. 12:27, when I have to drive another 3.5 hrs to make a late afternoon Tee Time makes a big difference.  I'm most likely going to book the BOS-->YHZ using CNB Crystal points through the concierge.

^^^^^.
**Inbound options are much more limited and more expensive**
I can't get United to show any mid day flights from YYG or YQM to DEN, it's only showing me flights with 5am-7am departure times.  I also can't find any fixed mileage awards on Aeroplan, so it looks like I'm limited to paying dynamic prices on Aeroplan or redeeming through the Chase Portal or CNB (until I run out of points there).  

Since timing is fairly similar between YQM and YYG flights, I'll gladly pay 6,000 miles to not have to drive 1.5 hrs to YQM.  Similarly, I'll gladly pay $28 to have 1 stop vs. 2 stops.  So it looks like the best inbound flight is the first one listed - YYG - DEN 12:10 - 20:33 for $74.96 out of pocket and 45,700 miles.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

^^^^^.
**Questions:**

1. Is it possible to call in to United and get their pricing for the Air Canada flights on 7/19 even though I can't find them online?
2.  There are 2 Air Canada flights that I can't find available on points through Aeroplan.  Will these potentially become available later?  Can I call and see if I can book that way?
3.  Is there a better Star Alliance parter (Singapore, Avianca, ANA, etc) where I could get a better award ticket price on 7/19?  Or would there need to be a Fixed Mileage Award available on AC for that to be possible?  I don't see any flights coming up in the other Star Alliance partners search engines
4.  I know this will be high season in Prince Edward Island, but I would expect flight prices to come down some, does it make sense to wait on the award booking?

I'd like to burn through my TYP, so if this is somehow bookable on SQ, I'd love to do that.

**TLDR:** I know this is long, and if you made it this far, I commend you.  Thank you for any help or advice with getting to and from PEI is greatly appreciated."
"2017-03-14 22:23:59"|"[Trip Report] Round the World trip on SIN, ANA, JAL"|"X-Post from Trip Report Weekly on r/churning


Snow day here in NYC. Might as well write this up as I was procrastinating. Long post here


In January I flew a Round the World Trip. Years ago I read a blog post about Singapore Airline Suites and its been my dream since to fly it. In June 2016 I finally convinced myself to hop on the waitlist for suites on January 12th 2017. 


I finally got off the waitlist 1 week before my flight. Tears were rolling down my eyes when I received the text. Now it was a scramble to figure out the rest of my trip and how the hell am I going to fly back.


I read TPG?s post on his trip to the Maldives(I know, I know). I realized I probably won?t be this close to the Maldives again. Unfortunately there was no free nights available through the Hyatt certs but points nights were. I moved 75k UR over and booked 3 nights there. There was also no availability on award flights to MLE so I booked a one way cash flight on Tigerair for $150.


As for the Suites flight, once I shown the flight attendants my ticket, they quickly lead me to my Suite. I was so giddy. The seat itself was so comfy and huge. I even got to experience the double beds in the middle as there was only 3 passengers in Suites including myself. My dream was came true. I spent about 2 days in Singapore, then off to the Maldives


My god the Park Hyatt Maldives was beautiful. I?ve never been on a resort or an isolated island before so this was luxurious to me. I loved the outdoor shower. Unfortunately I didnt get into the Park Hyatt until 2am the first night. And the food was mighty expensive. I blew $700 on food for only 2 nights.


After 2 nights it was time to fly back to SIN. I managed to snag a Y fare on Srilankan airlines using BA Avios. 


After reading many good reviews about ANA and JAL, I wanted an excuse to fly it. I found a one way 40k ANA F flight from SIN to NRT. As a big Star Wars fan, I was ecstatic to found out my plane was the BB-8 plane all with Star Wars music playing as I entered in. The seat wasn?t as comfy as Suites but still better than economy. 


This was my 3rd time in Tokyo, second time being just last month in December. I flew the MSP-HND Delta route for 50k during their sale. Eat and partied like usual. I would never have thought I could go to Tokyo back to back months.


Flying back to NYC, I managed to get a seat with JAL F for 80k AA miles. I love the free massage at the Sakura lounge and the sushi bar. 


All and all I started off 2017 with a big bucket list flight itinerary. JFK-FRA-SIN-MLE-CMB-SIN-NRT-JFK all within 11 days. I?m not sure what the cash value is for this entire trip but its hella more than I?m willing to pay for.


Service and good among all 3 F flights were amazing. This was my first time flying F and I had high expectations and met every single one. ANA and JAL do have a better snack menu than SIN.


Heres a breakdown of points for my trip off the top of my head.

JFK-FRA-SIN, about 90K UR points after SIN?s 15% discount

SIN-MLE, $150 on tigerair

PH Maldives transport, $500 on my arrival+

MLE-CMB-SIN, about 15k Avois

SIN-NRT, 40k UR on ANA F using United

NRT-JFK, 80k AA

PH Maldives, 75k UR 3 nights


Other comments. 

The Virgin America lounge in JFK is beautiful. I wish I had more time here but I was stuck on the subway coming over. 


I also managed to get into the Private Room at SIN on an arrival flight. Told desk agent I was waiting for friend to arrive.


I usually stay in hostels for my travels. Save some money and met other travelers along the way. The F flights to hostels were definitely a big change.

We are planning on going to Italy and Greece (Naples, Rome, Amalfi Coast, Athens, Santorini, Mykonos), so I assume we would fly into FCO or NAP and out of ATH, or vice versa. We haven't decided an itinerary yet, so we can do either order (Greece then Italy, or Italy then Greece).

We are aiming to fly F or J for both of the longer international flights, but we are fine with economy for connections within Europe. We are based out of SFO. I would prefer only 1 layover, and don't really want to re-position or overshoot unless its really good value.

I've been on /r/churning for a while and have amassed a good amount of points, but haven't ever done a miles redemption before for premium flights, so I am a bit confused about what is the best option for redemption for value, availability, and product. I'm also not sure when I should start looking for flights, since its roughly a year out (but I've heard that you have to start this early sometimes). So I am hoping you guys can help us out here with strategy.

I did some research, and it seems like there are only 4 airlines that have first class from SFO to Europe (BA, SWISS, Air France, Lufthansa). SWISS and Air France seem to only release F awards to their elite members, and Lufthansa has that 15 days before rule, so those all seem to be ruled out. BA I was told is not a great F product, so I wasn't sure if that was worth it.

For J flights, I saw the following airlines:

* Aer Lingus
* Air France
* Turkish
* SWISS
* Iberia
* United
* Delta

Between the two of us, we expect to have at least the following points by October that we could transfer:

* 400k UR
* 200k MR
* 100k TYP
* 120k Marriott
* We have negligible amounts of miles with UA, AA, CX as well (roughly 10k each)

As for status, we only have the following (until end of year):

* CX Silver (myself)
* AA Gold (P2)
* United Silver (possibly, through corporate status match)

Thanks for the help, and let me know if I missed any critical info!"

"2015-05-13 23:46:32"|"Minimizing annual fees, maintaining 1:1 transfers"|"Hi all,

I've amassed quite a few chase UR points (210k+), and probably will be getting more.

The main issue is that the only cards that allow 1:1 transfer on airlines have annual fees of at least $95, which could burn through that value pretty quickly.

Right now I have a CSP which will expire in November.  Once that happens, what's my best plan?

I believe there are only 1 or 2 other chase cards that allow the 1:1 transfer (2 versions of chase ink I think).

The CSP could be canceled and re-churned 2 years later, but what about in-between?

My thoughts:

1.  I could transfer some of the points to an airline, but don't know where I'm going yet, so would have to take a best guess.  United would probably be the safest.

2.  The ink card seems like it might be a good long-term play since it offers 5% back on cell phone + internet/tv usage.  For me that's $172/month, or $2064 per year.  5% is 4% more than I'd normally get at 1%, so I suppose I'd already be making $82 back extra in points, which mostly covers the $95 fee.

Any other ideas?  Find a way to rotate cards in and re-churn every other year?  What other cards for chase offer 1:1?

Right now, I could do:

- Year 1: CSP (opened 10/2014) - 11/2014, then cancel/downgrade
- Year 2: Chase ink (apply in 11/2014) - good through 12/2014

At this point , could I churn the CSP?  Does that 24-month churn rule apply from the date you first applied, or from the end of your first period?  If the latter I suppose I could just keep the ink open for another year since the 5% utility cash back is pretty good."

Here is the situation: My stepfather is an authorized user on my mother's Amex card, where she has accrued 200,000 MR points. My mother had been battling Alzheimer's for many years, and was unable to transfer any of her points over to her husband before her condition worsened. My stepfather has power of attorney, and can manage her accounts, but will need to close the account soon, since she recently passed away. Because he cannot transfer the MR points out to another Amex card, I thought his best bet would be to transfer them to an airline or hotel.

I was hoping to help him use these points, perhaps on a much-needed vacation. When he flies, he usually uses AA or United. However, since neither of these airlines are transfer partners with MR, I need to find another use for them. 

Are there any downsides to him just transferring all of the points to Cathay Pacific? I thought this would be best, since he could then use them on AA flights, but I am not experienced enough in this hobby to know if I am missing any pitfalls.

Two R/T J tickets on Brussels from JFK/Brussels in August 2017! Total cost was 72k AMEX MR for both tickets combined. I transferred them to Etihad Guest and then used their amazing partner rates on Brussels Airlines to score the tickets. I called the Etihad UK call center because they apparently have the best trained CS reps there. 

The only real issue was that I found plenty of availability on United's website... but the Etihad CS reps couldn't see it despite me calling 5x to different reps. I think it's because the blogs just picked up on this deal today, so hundreds of people are likely booking it up and the United site hasn't updated yet (just a theory). Well on my 6th call, I finally tried a new combination of dates and they could see it too! I had such an adrenaline rush when they confirmed lol.

tl;dr: I can probably get myself up to 200-250k Avios if I put all my eggs into the Avios basket. But is it worth it?

**First things first - my current balances** 
			
	American Airlines (AAdvantage) **	119,733

	JetBlue Airways (trueBlue) **	21,787

	Marriott Rewards **	17,906					
	Amex (Membership Rewards)	52,877		
	Barclaycard Arrival Plus	1980		
	Chase **	28,075	

We do not MS. I probably can't get the full 100k Avios from the current offer without MS, but if I open an LRCU account I can easily get 50k + 25k = 75k avios.

Note 1: we have the SW companion pass via my wife's account through 12/16. So no sense going for more SW points right now, we'll focus on that late next year to re-up our CP.

Note 2: Neither of us is eligible for CSP thanks to new rules. Original plan was to get 2 of those. Wife had it once 3 years ago. I have Ink+ Biz card and earn 1200 points monthly from auto billpay to cable/phone companies.

Note 3: I am not getting the current United 50k targeted offer, only the 30k offer.	

Note 4: Wife got 50k Amex MR bonus in 2014, converted points to BA Avios during 1.4x redemption, card is cancelled. Neither of us have had the Amex platinum.

Note 5: We do not MS. I am open to the idea of the $15k LRCU account hack, though.

Note 6: FICO 812, income is good.

**My trip desires**

My wife is a teacher and I have decent vacation time. We'd like to do 3-4 weeks somewhere we haven't been before that won't break the bank with food/hotels. Ideal destinations include Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Budapest, all of Asia, India, all of Africa (esp S. Africa), all of Australia/NZ. Flexible travel dates late July/August 2016. Asia is probably highest on the list for both of us, but we're open.

It would be fun to move around a bit during the trip, but neither of us love flying so we mostly want to have one long travel day coming and going and minimize flying around once we're there. 1-2 additional flight days max during the trip. It would be fun to travel in business or first but we're not going to kill ourselves getting points to upgrade. 

I've never been to London and would be open to 3-4 days there even though it's an expensive city. But I'd rather not pay their enormous taxes on ""free"" flights.

Not interested in anywhere US, Canada, Caribbean, Latin America, or Eastern Europe for this trip - we want to go somewhere new :)

Home airport is Boston, easy enough to get to JFK via JetBlue points if necessary.

**Card thoughts**

Wife and I can probably swing one more card each this fall, depending on minimum spend. Then we can probably do another card each in the winter. So we want to put those cards towards points so we can redeem them early. In the winter we can probably each do another card, probably go for hotel cards at that point. Might go for a third set of cards next spring, again with hotel cards.

My original plan was to load up on Chase UR points by getting each of us a CSP. But that plan is now ruined thanks to the 5/24 rule.

I was then going to go for United points by going for the Chase United cards, but the 50k deals seem to have vanished except for business cards - I have a biz card via Ink, not sure if I can get the United biz card or not.

Looks like I missed the 100k Amex Platinum deal (I was on vacation using my SW companion pass, so I won't complain too much!).

Am still keeping my fingers crossed that the 140k RC offer comes back so we can do a fly + stay redemption.

I have zero use for airport lounge access, fee reimbursements, or most other perks. All I want is points.

**Questions**

Given my limited options to get more AA points, get Chase UR points via CSP, or get a decent stockpile of United miles, it seems like I should focus on BA. But I have never heard anything good about Avios except short haul (we don't want short haul for this trip) and have never had great experiences with their website. And since flying F or J on BA is now ludicrously expensive via points AND has huge surcharges on BA metal via London, I'm hesitant to go all in on Avios. So...

* Should I transfer my MR points to BA before the devaluation on 10/1?
* Should I go for the current BA card offer, recognizing that I don't MS and this might present an opportunity cost if some other better offer comes up?
* Are there other offers I'm missing that will help us have a truly memorable trip?
* If I do go all-in on Avios, is there some amazing routing/destination that will maximize my fun with Avios? I really don't care too much where we go next summer as long as it's new to us and beautiful.
* If I decide not to pursue Avios as a strategy, what's should I do instead?

The time has finally come that I start planning my honeymoon taking place next Oct 2020. I've been dreading this day because I would always get lost on the best approach to booking flights/hotels.

We have a combined total of 700k Ultimate Reward points. I have a Sapphire Reserve & she has a Sapphire Preferred. We're trying to go all out on this trip (business/first flights + nicer hotels) with the idea that we can book saver fares to get the most bang for 'buck'.

Based on everything I've read, sending points directly United would be my best option due to lower taxes/fuel charges, but I read this will be increasing starting next month. Average saver business pricing seems to be 140k points/pp + a couple hundred in taxes/fees with a stop somewhere on the East coast. Seems like no non-stop flights from LAX. All other airlines seem to have an exorbitant amount of fuel surcharges. As for hotels, I am not sure if I should look into Marriott/Hyatt or just book through the UR Portal.

Looking for recommendations to book the ""ultimate"" two week honeymoon from LAX to Italy (trying to hit Venice, Rome, & Amalfi Coast, likely via train)... and maybe even using the ""free"" United excursionist perk for a night or two in Paris. No preference as to what city we start/end the trip.

Main questions below, but feel free to comment on any other part of my plan:

1. Is sending UR points to United the best option for someone flying out of LAX to Italy?
2. When is the best time to start booking? I'm trying to be proactive because I can't book this last minute.
3. Hotels via Chase UR Portal or directly with Marriott/Hyatt?

__________________

I've been doing some calculations (on the major programs) and to be honest they just seem like they are totally not worth the time and effort put in

If I stick with United and accounting for taxes, I would have to spend around ~7000$ just to get enough for a free economy flight that is realistically worth about 800$ max

Meanwhile I could score deals with airlines that United have no partnerships when travelling internationally that are on average like 200$ less EACH TIME 

so by the time you want to redeem mileage you're actually either getting back some of those differences or gaining very very little that I would say it's not worth the time at all

Secondly:  One option may be to buy economy class tickets and then use points to upgrade to business.  This is something that I have never done before.  So, I look on United.  First problem is that JFK flights direct to TYO do not seem to be candidates to be upgraded.  That annoying.  Second, when I do for choose to use EWR I get a fare quote but only with ""Upgrade waitlist"" ... is this typical?  I do not want to have any question that I have these tickets as business class.  Are upgrades not definite?  Is this just a United thing or standard practice on all airlines?

Any advice, insight is appreciated.  Thanks!"

I currently live in the US (DC area) and I am looking to take a trip to New Zealand in early/mid 2019.

I am looking for any advice on how to get the most points possible to make this trip happen. Air New Zealand is my preferred airline for this trip, so I am focusing on Star Alliance as a way to earn points there. I don't know which hotel chains are popular in NZ, so any recommendations there would be helpful.

I am only aware of United which allows stopover and have less fuel surcharge. Interested to know other options if available.  

1. Is it a good strategy to transfer miles to UA and book the trip with UA miles?  
2. Should I just book two one way award ticket from IAD - LON and FRA- IAD and book remaining tickets with British Airways miles ( transferring UA to BA)? Would be interested to know about any airlines that offer free stopover and open Jaw..

AA
----
All during the summer and until mid sept, confirmable upgrade space on AA was readily available 1-3 days out.  It would typically appear 3 days out, and you'd have 7/7 U/C (upgrade or SAAVER biz class) seats available.  

This worked great, as long as you could be a bit flexible, but I was able to get upgraded 5/6 tries.  My strategy was to book a refundable ticket for the day I wanted, and if it became available, upgrade for only 15k miles (instead of $350+25k for discount economy).   This usually cost ~ the same and earned 1.5 EQM.

If availability didn't happen, I simply moved the date and paid the difference.  I was 2/3 with this move.

This changed mid-late sept though, and 7/7 has become 0/0.  This is frustrating and an unwelcome surprise, as it now appears that AA is releasing zero confirm-able upgrade space.  I should be exec-plat next year, but I may be traveling with (3) companions and I'm unsure of how many you can upgrade with you (paid upgrades).

UNITED
----
United typically had award flights available sporadically 1-2 months out, available for 70k miles.  This too now is gone.

DELTA
----
Occaisionally I'd find the 80k flights but I spent way less time on this one.

***

My brother and his wife are going on a trip and are willing to use my miles if it's a good value for me and gives them some amount of discount. I'm all for it as long as there is enough value in the discount price for me to use the points/miles.

Here's the breakdown. They want to go Seattle to Santiago Chile around the 6th/7th of December. Then on the way back they want to go from Buenos Aires to Seattle, around the 24th or 25th.

There are some great tickets on the way down. Delta, United, American Airlines all have ~30k miles + $5-$10 flights. 

On the way back there are less options and more expensive (presumably due to Christmas). 

Here are the flights on the way down:

* American Airlines one way to Santigo: 30,000 miles + $5.60
* United Airlines one way to Santiago: 30,000 miles + $5.60
* Delta Airlines one way to Santiago: 35,000 + $5.60
* Same Delta booked through Air France: 29,000 miles + $10

For returns, American Airlines is the best bet. All of these have high fees (about $90 compared to $5.60 on the way down). Looks like coming in the opposite direction has some other taxes and fees.

* United has 70k + ~$90 and really long 2-stop flights. They're an expensive currency compared to others, and long stops, so not good. 
* Delta has 100k + ~$90. This is the one mile type I don't have a lot of, and can't transfer from other points (at least not economically), so this puts it out of contention entirely.
* American has 55k + ~$90 on the 24th or 75k + ~$90 on the 25th, with one stop. I have 500k of these and they're easy to acquire more of, so this is good in all respects.

***

I sent them all of the above. I then told them:

So really your first choice is: miles or dollars. I think it needs to be all miles or all dollars. One-ways with dollars are expensive, as you saw, so doing one with dollars and one with miles won't work. Either you need to pay for the whole thing with money, or do miles both directions. 

Assuming miles:

Decide what to take on the way down. Mostly they're the same so whatever times you like more and/or whatever miles I want to use up the most.

Basically only realistic option on the way back is American Airlines, deciding whether to goon the 24th or 25th (55 or 75k miles). 

Here's two specific itineraries just to price match. Using American Airlines so that $ and miles are compared on the same exact route.

American Airlines to Santiago, coming back from BA on the 24th: 85,000 miles + $96.81. Google flights has this for $2402. https://goo.gl/flights/tUoA4 14-15 hours on the way down, 17-19 hours on the way back.

American Airlines to Santiago, coming back from BA on the 25th: 105,000 miles + $96.81. Same $2402 on Google flights. That means it's less valuable (mile wise) because more miles for same cash price. But, one extra day. 

If you were to do cash, Air Canada is cheapest at $1623 but on the way back it's 28-hour 2-stop flights. United is $2193 with 15 hours on the way there and 18 hours on the way back. So if you're going to do miles, closest comparison is United $2193 and American Airlines $2402.

Rough math:
Let's say you do the 105000 (30k+75k) miles with both ways on American Airlines and come back on the 24th from Buenos Aires. That's $90 ish in fees, $100 to make it easy for rough calculations. So 105000 miles gets you 2402-100=2302 of flight value. Obviously if you were doing cash you'd be going for United. $2193 would get you back $98 of value as points per person (3% and then 1.5 cents each value, so 4.5%). So anything more than $98 off the price is ""valuable"" to you in that scenario, though $99 off probably isn't worth it.

*** 

**Ok, context done**

So how much is ""fair"" (""fare"", even) in this case? If they paid me $1700 per person that would be $1600 (after paying fees) for 105,000 AA miles which is just over 1.5 cents each. I know they're worth more for various aspirational flights but I'm not taking those, so I shouldn't benchmark against that. Is 1.5 for normal travel good for that? Or should I do something like $1900 (so $1800 after paying fees)?

Small side-note: I have some AA gift cards which would work perfectly for paying these fees if we do this. They each have a reserve, if I paid the fees with $1 on each of their Reserves and the rest on GC they'd still get protection benefits, right? Even if it's miles? As long as the Reserve is used for at least once cent to pay for the booking it's good?

Would really appreciate help with this! They're fine with whatever number. I want to be fair to them (ie not offering just $10 off what they could get with cash, for example) but I also don't want to lose ""too much"" in point value. Thoughts?"

I'm looking to do a European trip for me and my girlfriend in J class. We would be leaving from LAX and are looking to do Italy and Paris. Travel date is flexible between Jan-March and trip would be about 2 weeks or so.

Currently looking at doing Italy for about 9 to 10 days and do Rome to Florence to Venice then Paris for 4 or 5 days.

My current balances are

Looking at award bookings via United's site, it looks like this
- LAX to ZRH to FCO via Swiss Airlines on their Boeing 777-300ER via a Business Saver Award at 70k + $21.50
- Return is CDG to ZRH to LAX via Swiss Airlines on their Boeing 777-300ER via a Business Saver Award at 70k + $116.66

A few questions:
- Ideally I would like to use the 55k UA miles and save as much UR as possible, so in total I'm looking at around 280k miles for 2 J's roundtrip.

- Is there a better way to utilize open jaw rules? Or should I just do 1 ways to and from Europe?

- Is there a better transfer partner to utilize the UR points?

- Anyone have experience with Swiss Business class, especially if flying with a partner?

- How is weather in Italy/Paris during the Jan-March months. I understand it will be winter there and wondering if it would be too cold and some of the things we want to see while in Italy may be closed or not.

Thanks for any advice in advance!

That means I can book the whole length of my trip as one round trip, which sounds too good to be true! Because I'm gonna use United, I have a bunch of things I want to clarify with you guys. Most of what I've learned comes from this article: http://travelisfree.com/2014/08/26/united-routing-rules/ Here's what I understand so far. Please correct me if I'm wrong about anything!

**My Current Understanding:**

- United changed the rules recently, so you can only have open-jaws in your destination region.  
- The destination region is determined by which region is more ""powerful"". 
- Because my flights go through Asia and Europe, and Asia is more ""powerful"", United makes Asia my ""destination"", and I'm free to have a stopover in Italy.  
- this also means that I don't have a choice of making Europe my ""destination"" and use my open-jaws in Europe, when thats more useful (spending more time in Europe). 
- Stopover length is 6 months, but that's not a problem since my total trip length is 4months. 
- When I transfer points to United, it gets stored in my United mileage account.  Then, the way I use them determines the Saver, Standard or MileagePlus awards.  (It initially seemed like there were 3 or more different account choices to transfer to, which totally confused me)

Again, if i seem wrong/confused about anything, please correct me!

**My Trip Preferences**

- Chase UR: 102k points
- LAX is home, surrounding airports work too, as well as SFO (I could drive to SF beforehand if something works out better) 
- Travel Destinations: Singapore (quick visit, < 3days), Shanghai(3 weeks), Taipei(5 days), Italy(1 month), bunch cities all over Europe (5 days each)
- Cabin Preference: Economy
- Just me as the traveler 

**My Best Option:**
I searched for this in United's search engine

- LAX(home) - SIN(singapore)   :   End of April 
- SHA(shanghai) - FCO(rome)    :   End of May
- FCO(rome) - LAX(home)         :   End of August 

This uses 1 open-jaw and 1 stopover.  If I try to book a 2nd open jaw while in China, I get a ""We were unable to process your request"".  So without dealing with that or calling in, I think this is my best option.  It costs 75k points + $117, which seems like a great deal compared to the ""Purchase without redeeming miles"" option of $7,449.    

**My Questions:**

1. If I'm using Chase UR points, is the decision to transfer them to United even the best option? Did I miss a better option?
2. Is there a way to make Europe my ""destination""?  If it were possible, this would be a better option, because I'm spending a majority of my time in Europe and I could book my two open-jaws there
3. Based on my current search, am I getting the best deal? 75k points + $117.  
4. I mean 10c/pt is really awesome, but how do I know I'm actually getting a good deal, vs United just showing me a really expensive ticket price in the ""Buy without miles"" option to make me feel good?  
5. aka-How do you peeps calculate your cents per point valuation?
6. Because I might only need to use 1 open-jaw, 1 stopover, maybe Singapore Airlines is a better option?  <- I'm now doing some reading into that, but for now clarification on United Awards would be appreciated. I'll learn about Singapore Awards myself, and probably have a followup post similar to this focused on Singapore Airlines. 
7. If there's anything I missed, let me know!

I was planning on booking a pair of RT tickets from JFK to INC for the beginning of September. I have 40k miles with united and was going to transfer 100k UR points to pay for both tickets. 

My biggest concern is seat selections. When I looked through united's portal, it told me i could not select seats. I am a pretty tall guy and was hoping to get a seat with legroom, especially for a 14.5hr flight. Would I be able to select seats once I've booked the flight? 

Sorry if this has been answered before or common knowledge. My first time booking with points and I couldn't find more info anywhere."
"2017-07-22 04:06:11"|"Newbie traveling Las Vegas to Bangkok. Grateful for help."|"[EDIT - Traveling round trip - returning BKK to LAS 3 months later].

I have Chase Ultimate Rewards 141,000; Cap One 53k; Delta 80k.

Would like to leave somewhere between 2 weeks from now and by at latest the 2nd week in September.
Leaving about 3 or 4 weeks from now probably best for time to prepare, etc. but could get out in 2 weeks if needed.

I've only checked Chase's travel portal so far.
Want to avoid Chinese airlines based on what I've read (which are the cheapest flights)  and would like to get there in approx. 24 - 28 hours. (i.e., don't want to take a 35 hour flight for cheaper rate - unless amazing deal or great deal on upgrade involved).

The best prices for economy and my qualifications on the Chase portal [EDIT - for round trip economy] are in this range:
Aug. 29th:  All Nippon  $798.26/ 53,217 miles   23:58 hrs./min.; also - 
Aug. 29th  United  $802.16/ 53477 United 24:13  

so I would be using the miles at the 1.5 cents/mile that Chase Sapphire Reserve gives.

Would consider Premium Economy or Business if a great deal.

Knowledgable people like all of you can probably do a lot better - would be grateful for any guidance, or point me to a site to help me do better with my miles, or suggestions to get me started.

It's a bit overwhelming at the minute.


Tyia.

"2017-12-25 01:40:18"|"Wild ride with LifeMiles"|"OK. You guys know I book a lot of travel for clients. This is the kind of crazy stuff I do for my own travel. I thought of posting this in /r/awardstoriesgonewild (and might cross-post it) but it's here for now. I'm going to blog about this too but in a lot less detail and a lot higher level.

I'm going to St. Helena on Saturday. It's one of the toughest places in the world to visit. The only similarly difficult place I have visited is Adak, Alaska (Antarctica was more difficult, but doesn't really count because there are no commercial flights there).

The way that you get to St. Helena is from Johannesburg or Cape Town via Windhoek. There is one flight a week, which is absurdly expensive. I wrote more about the flight and the airport here if anyone is interested: http://www.seat31b.com/2017/12/ringing-in-the-new-year-in-st-helena/ - it was cheaper for me to do this as an open jaw terminating in CPT and I wanted to end up in CPT anyway.

The hardest part of making all of this work was booking an award ticket to Johannesburg in the most peak part of peak season. This is, as most people know, nearly impossible. What saved me is that I decided to do this at the last minute (at least for the time being, I have enough control over my schedule to do this). Cathay Pacific opens up award inventory starting 2 weeks before departure and they opened up one seat in F from SFO-HKG on the date I needed. There were plenty of seats onward in J from there to JNB. And as luck would have it, AS had a single Y seat available from SEA-SFO so I was able to get an award all the way through. Using the exceptionally generous Alaska award chart, this trip cost only 70k miles so I went ahead and booked it. This got me 13,541 flown miles in CX F and J for just 70,000 Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles.

The problem was getting back. I really didn't want to fly to South Africa without a ticket home and there wasn't any availability in J or F on CX. While I usually fly economy class, it's a loooooooooong flight from South Africa - Africa is **huge** and the flight from Europe to South Africa is as long or longer than a transatlantic flight to Europe. And although economy class was wide open with every mileage currency I had, this just isn't a good use of points due to the relatively cheap economy class fares (around $500 all-in paid vs. 40k points + $100+ with most mileage currencies).

So, my goal was to get back in a premium cabin, and to use my Avianca LifeMiles. I don't trust all of the mileage sales that LifeMiles has had recently, and don't really trust the shaky financial condition of Avianca either, so wanted to clean out my account before the devaluation that I suspect is coming. Also, while I'm not generally a premium cabin traveler, it has gotten very hard to book premium cabins with LifeMiles lately which in my opinion is another bad sign for the program (while the airline accounting behind the scenes is secret, it's widely believed that airlines pay considerably more in cash for business and first class redemptions vs. economy class). I also thought it would be cool to route directly back to North America or via Europe vs. returning via Asia, since this makes the trip a true RTW.

Well, when I went to check the new LifeMiles site, some really crazy stuff happened. It started pulling up mixed cabin awards, which are new. An itinerary combining one Lufthansa segment in Y from JNB-FRA and UA segments in F from FRA-ORD and Y from ORD-SNA cost under 50k points. Note that Europe-NA in J is 63k points on the LifeMiles chart, so I have no idea how the calculation was being done. Another itinerary in J from JNB-FRA-LHR (Y) + LHR-SFO (J) was 51k points. Note that one way in J on a through routing, no mixed cabins, is 78k points on this route so a *substantial* discount is being given for Y segments on mixed cabin itineraries.

What I really wanted, and what was available in Starnet, was either SAA from JNB-IAD in J and UA from IAD-SEA (but I didn't like the timing of this flight), or SAA from JNB-LHR in J and UA from LHR-ORD in J and ORD-SEA in Y. But there were two major problems: nothing at all on South African comes up on the LifeMiles site and there is no way to make it appear, and the flight from ORD-SEA wasn't coming up either, even though it was obviously available.

I gritted my teeth and decided to suck up a Y leg from JNB-FRA, figuring F from FRA-ORD might make up for it (*might* being the operative word, it's United after all). I got all the way to the end, plugged in my credit card information, and BAM - the site puked. Tried again, fail. OK, called LifeMiles, and the friendly representative informed me that basically everything was broken on the site right now and not to expect to book anything through it. So I could either book with him for an $80 fee, or I could take screen shots and email them to support@lifemiles.com for assistance at no fee.

I went ahead and did it, also telling the support desk my preferred dates and cities (I wanted to end up in Seattle). They wrote back a day later asking for a picture of my passport, which I provided. Another day later, I got an email informing me that my request had been escalated and to watch my email because when my itinerary was booked I'd have to call LifeMiles to pay within 24 hours.

A full day later, at the end of the day, and with absolutely no context I got a confirmation (in Spanish) for a flight to Seattle. It was LH in Y from JNB-FRA, UA in F from FRA-ORD, and UA in Y from ORD-SEA. Sweet! I got on the phone to the Avianca call center and one of the strangest, craziest things that has ever happened with an airline transpired.

The call center representatives were familiar with the type of booking I had, but they couldn't do anything with it. There is apparently a department inside LifeMiles with one guy working there at any given time, and you have to be transferred to him. His English isn't great but he's super friendly and very nice. When he reviewed the itinerary with me and asked if it's what I wanted, I said ""well, this isn't exactly what I wanted, can you check if another itinerary is available?"" He agreed, so I gave him the specific itinerary I wanted (from the United Web site).

So, this guy is working directly in Amadeus and pulling inventory from Starnet. And that means two things are happening. The first is that none of the Starnet blocking on the LifeMiles site applies (and there is more of this blocking than not). The second is that they literally have no idea how to price mixed cabin itineraries, because whatever formula the Web site uses to calculate award pricing isn't available to the call center representatives. So they're empowered to estimate what an award should cost and astonishingly, you can actually negotiate this.

I ended up with an award costing 72,000 LifeMiles from JNB-SEA because one of the legs (ORD-SEA) is in Y. This looks pretty close to right and I don't feel like I got away with negotiating a cheaper price than I should have paid - similar itineraries on other airlines with similar lengths of domestic legs in Y reflect a similar discount.  Still, when you're calling in to book an award, be sure to remind them of the difference in mixed cabin pricing and have some plausible numbers in mind for the mileage discount you want to request (based on itineraries that price out online). Of course, this will not be an issue if you're calling in for help with ticketing an itinerary that fully appears online, because you can back up the pricing with screen shots; the negotiation only applies if you change the itinerary when you're talking to the call center.

About dealing with the Avianca call center: The representatives are in Colombia and El Salvador where Spanish is the first language. It really helps if you can speak Spanish, but if you can't, speak clearly, don't talk too fast, and use simple vocabulary. A lot of people complain about the LifeMiles call center but I think they just don't have experience working with people in Latin America. The representatives are friendly and helpful if you are friendly to them, and show them some respect. Latin America is actually a very polite culture so saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" and exchanging polite greetings goes a long way toward making you someone they want to help vs. just another rude gringo.

Am I going to be sipping Krug champagne on a flight some blogger thinks is ""aspirational?"" Nope! But none of that stuff really matters. I'm getting a perfectly reasonable lie flat seat for 9,574 miles of flying, plus Y for another 1,721 miles, and it cost me 72,000 LifeMiles that are extremely difficult to use, and I suspect are very close to devaluing. With this redemption I managed to clean out my LifeMiles account and also to book a flight on an airline that is virtually never bookable with LifeMiles.

The only one downside? I was just shy of the points I needed so had to buy 3,000 of them. When you book over the phone LifeMiles isn't able to sell you any more miles than needed to book the award, so I ended up having to pay 3.3 cents each (I missed a mileage sale by literally one day). Still, this was only $99 which is a very small price to pay (along with the ~$100 in tax and $25 booking fee) for the award.

If I am looking to get airline status, would it not make sense to try on say, Delta or united as opposed to AA?

If I were to chase United or Delta status, I would always have chances at upgrades and boarding first because the % chance of people holding status with them is very small, because of the AA hub status.

Amateur points enthusiast here. Probably not on the same level as many of you and have never made a huge points redemption for travel which is why I'm seeking out your help.

We're in the Bay Area and are okay from leaving from any airport here, though SJC or SFO are preferable.

I didn't take it too seriously before and have mostly flown JetBlue because I don't/didn't think I'd fly enough to get any worthwhile status on another airline, but am reconsidering and would love some thoughts from the group here. I really like their product and service all around and the frequency/timing of direct flights from JFK to the west coast, but realizing even if I hit Mosaic status, it's not really helpful as you don't get upgrades with it, and with no alliance/without many partners, I mainly get more JetBlue flights.

I also have heard from many people (and here) that since there are so many hardcore business flyers out of JFK, the odds of getting regular upgrades on my routes at a lower tier of status are pretty slim. Would consider opening another credit card to speed up/amplify benefits/miles earned. Currently use my CSR for everything.

My priority is to make my primary travel (to the West Coast) as comfortable as possible, but miles and upgrades for my vacations and other trips would be a nice bonus, just not sure I'll get any of them. I like JetBlue & Alaska (experiences, product, companies), am indifferent to AA/Delta, and despise United (plus don't want to be stuck with everything being out of EWR).

I like Delta's ~~transfer partners~~ alliance a bit more and my recent research makes me think I'd do okay with them. How's the product on the transcon flights on the 757?

Stats:

* I'm based in NYC, my preferred airport (by a long stretch) is JFK.
* Generally, I fly to the West Coast (SFO or LAX) for work at least 6 times a year, as well as various other ad hoc trips. Most domestic, but occassional international popping up as well. I'd generally be in Premium Economy but can sometimes get Business Class fares in my range.
* For personal travel, my future MIL is based in LA, so we usually go out there at least 2 more times a year. Plus other trips/vacations (3-4 times a year, sometimes domestic, sometimes international- South America and Europe recently and the near future).
* I'm on track to fly a little over 55k miles this year, likely the same or more next year as well."

We are located in DEN so my first thought is United, but we also have a ton of Southwest points and could easily do a positioning flight if need be. 330 days from Thanksgiving '19 would roughly be the end of December, so currently I am just wondering what you all would recommend as the best course of action for airlines/flights to look into. Business/First would be nice if they are reasonably priced, but we have no problem going with Economy if need be since it is a relatively short transatlantic flight. I know about the large fees when flying back from the UK, so we are also considering doing 5 days in London and then 1-2 in Paris before heading home (we have both been to Paris several times, so the 1-2 days would be sufficient for us - London is really our focus of this trip). 

We currently have ~190k UR, 150k Marriott, and once the points post will have ~220k MR and ~150k RR and CP. We have also been planning on grabbing several more MR cards so that number will likely increase rather drastically before next November unless there is a better avenue to take in preparation for the trip."

Would love opinions on ORD > LHR > ATH for honeymoon next September."|"So I've done a ton of research, browsing this sub, and signing up for various airline award programs to check rates to start planning this trip in September of next year. I apologize in advance if I don't have a total grasp on all the acronyms/rules yet!

Based on everything I've read, I'd love to avoid LHR but we will be kicking off our honeymoon by attending a wedding in Birmingham, UK on 9/4/2020, maybe spending a day or two in London, and then flying to Greece for the proper honeymoon (not sure which islands/cities yet).

I am working with Chase UR. Have about 100k but could possibly rack up an additional 20-30k in 2-3 months. Hoping to fly J on at least one of the long haul flights. We're usually economy class people so we'd like to splurge if possible. 

So far, based on Chase's transfer partners and hoping to avoid exorbitant fees (looking at you BA), United with their excursionist perk seems to be the best bet:

* ORD > LHR 60k each + fees
* LHR > ATH 0 each + fees
* ATH > ORD 30k each plus fees (probably going to just do economy on the way back)

Total: 180k + fees

I found these figures by searching random March dates, which I believe is non-peak and I assume September is the same. The dates are flexible aside from making the 9/4 wedding. 

My questions are:

Are there other airlines / programs I should be looking into for cheaper options? As I said I've dug around quite a bit so far and there are options that cost less in miles but the fees are insane.

**Most importantly**: As you can see I'll be 50-60k miles short. Would it be worth it to purchase the extra miles? Is that ever worth it? I haven't spent the CSR $300 travel credit and I believe that would be applied to purchasing those miles. I would love to collect a large chunk of miles via signup bonus, but unfortunately I'm at 5/24 with Chase (and therefore United).

If it's not worth purchasing miles, I guess I could use my UR points for rooms instead of flights and just buy economy flights with cash. 

Thanks for any help in advance!"

I had booked two business class tickets on their Boeing 777 for November travel, the day after my wedding. Now, with the flight being cancelled, I need to change my plans completely. The original flight left late Sunday night. United's alternative is an Asiana Airlines flight on their A380 Sunday morning.

* How does the business class product on Thai Airways 777 compare to Asiana Airlines A380? 
* As of right now, the Sunday morning flight on Asiana is the only one with award space. There is an EVA flight as well as and SQ flight that works for me, but SQ doesn't release much availability to United. Not sure if EVA does.

I currently have a Chase card (CSP) with a few points. I'm open to joining new cards and mileage programs (haven't opened new credit cards in years now).

Any opinions/anecdotes/advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"2015-09-14 22:19:29"|"Need help booking Europe to SE Asia"|"I'm currently traveling through Romania, Bulgaria, and much of the Central/Eastern Europe region.  Due to the length of travel visas for Americans (90 days) and my time already spent in Europe, **I'll need to leave by Oct. 23**. I'd like to fly from Europe to SE Asia, specifically BKK, Singapore, or anywhere central nearby that is affordable.

I'll most likely have to take a train, regional flight, or some transport to a larger hub city in Europe from wherever I'm at to make the trip. This is fine, the only preference is airports that are closer to the Central/Eastern cities (i.e. Italy, Germany, Austria, etc. versus airports in Madrid or Paris, **if possible**). 

However, I'm not sure what cities are transfer partners/hubs for the airlines I currently have points with.

Can anyone help me with suggestions on where to fly from and who to transfer my points to for dates that are near the one I have posted?

My plan is to fly out of the NYC area, go to Guam, and then Japan on the way back. Hitting up Taipei or ICN would be icing on the cake since they are pretty close to each other and flights are nonstop or fairly short.

I have 85k delta miles (hopefully this month)

150k MR 

95K UR 

40k AA

I can also borrow some UR from my relatives if necessary.
My current itinerary is:

12/10 JFK to Taipei ? 35k (Nonstop)

12/16 Taipei to ICN ? 22k (Nonstop, Asiana Airlines / United, or Thai airways 22K)

12/19 ICN to GUM ? 17.5k (1 stop, 7 hr, Asiana Airlines / United)

12/30-1/? GUM to NRT ? 30k (Nonstop, United, 4 full days in Japan)

Ideally leave on 1/5? but I can probably stay few more days if needed:

1/7 NRT to EWR ? 84k (Nonstop, United)

1/9 NRT ? LAX - JFK  (AA 35k miles, and 80k if earlier? )

1/7 (Delta 78K miles)

I also looked at Avios, and ANA and found out ANA requires a round trip so it wouldn?t work. The biz 80k is available but they wont let me book one way.
Virgin Atlantic looks promising with 40k miles to Seattle, and I can find my way back from Seattle to EWR.

My biggest issue right now is finding a return trip. Most of the flights I saw wanted about 100k points on that single leg. I'm open to suggestions. Taipei and ICN are optional if there are other paths.

I decided to only get Silver with United this past year and have upped my Delta flights because of this. Delta is way better anyway!

I'm based out of the PNW and fly to the east coast a lot and hit 176,656 MQMs (~21,000 rollover), 141 MQSs, and $22,553 MQDs. On United I had 29,185 PQMs, as well as ~11,000 miles on Alaska, and a measly 1,302 EQMs on American. A grand total of about 197,143 if I did my math correctly.

"2019-09-09 08:11:04"|"Flew First Class for the First Time Today"|"I started a new job in February where I have to fly from my home airport of GSP to BOS and back once a month, which through Delta usually necessitates a connection in ATL. Before February, I've only flown a handful of times over the years. 

My company's reimbursement policy is for ""the most economical fare class available"" and anything above that comes out of my pocket, but they do reimburse for checked bags. I started out flying Basic Economy, but after a couple of months figured out that Main Cabin was also reimbursed with no issues. 

Last month, the hotel that is recommended by my company was booked up and I found a bundle deal on Expedia for a slightly-less-fancy hotel and Comfort+ that was cheaper than just the normal rate for the recommended hotel. I did the same thing this month, but the bundle included a First Class ticket from GSP-BOS and Comfort+ on the return trip on Friday. Plus, since it was a bundle, I paid for the hotel + airfare weeks ago and have already been reimbursed by my company so there were no issues with my bundle deal making it past the bean counters.

I think I'm ruined for Main Cabin and Comfort+ now. I'm a bigger guy, and having the extra space in First Class where I never touched the person sitting next to me was by-far the best perk. Here's how I rate the rest of the experience. 

Great perks for First Class: 

* All the space. Since only two seats go into a section the width of three seats in C+ and Main Cabin, the seats are wider, there's almost a foot of armrest ""neutral ground"" between the two seats, and there was plenty of legroom. I actively avoid putting my backpack under the seat when possible because it always takes legroom away, but I don't think I would have even noticed it today. The seats also recline further, but I usually don't recline my seat so I didn't test this out.

* Free priority checked bags - I normally just bring a carry-on to avoid extra fees that I sometimes gate check, but this time I checked my carry-on and with the little yellow ""Priority"" tag on bag it was one of the first off the plane. Once I deplaned, went to the bathroom, and made it to the baggage pickup area, my bag was waiting on me. A great experience.

* Drink Service before take-off - It's awesome to get a drink before you take off. Normally, I'm used to grabbing a coffee or soda to bring onto the plane on main cabin, because it can take a while to take off and get to cruising speed, plus another 20+ min for the cart to get to my location, but in First you don't have to think about it. Just show up, board, and get whatever you want within 5-10 min. Awesome. 

* Multiple free drinks - I get a single free drink in C+, but it was nice on my flight from ATL-BOS to get a coffee w/ Baileys, a Bloody Mary, and a Bourbon and Coke Zero. 

* Drink service in first even when the rest of the plane doesn't get a drink service. The short 30-min hop from GSP to ATL never gets a drink service, but I had two coffees with Baileys in first, one pre-flight and another in the air. Awesome. 

* Free meal - I received an email a few days ago asking about my meal preference, and I chose a chicken sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. It came with a fruit plate and Chobani blueberry yogurt. It's no different than any other meal I could have gotten in the airport for $12, but I didn't have to worry about finding a meal before boarding. It was nice to just walk around during my layover without getting into long lines for food while trying to make a connection. 

* Pillow and blanket - first class domestic passengers get a little pillow and a blanket. The pillow made the already-comfortable seat even better. I didn't use the blanket, but it seemed decent. Another advantage of first class - you don't have to plan ahead to bring these things?just show up. 

* Flight Attendant attention - the flight attendant for First Class routinely checked to see if any of us needed anything. It felt like being at a nice restaurant rather than having your meal dropped off at a QSR. The attendant on both flights was also much more personable than in my previous non-FC flights.

* 150% mileage - a great bonus. I'm going to hit silver by EOY (I flew a few times on AA and United to figure out which airline to commit to), but this will help out greatly next year when I chase gold. 

Not awesome, but still nice: 

* When my boarding pass was scanned, the flight attended took the time to look at me, saying ""Enjoy your flight, Mr. <Amator>. I've never had that happen before on a flight. 

* Small water bottles waiting on the seat tray. Nice to have early in the morning when I was a bit thirsty and could have an immediate drink. 

* The armrest with built-in cup tray. It was nice to have a place for the drinks to sit without having to extend the table. 

* The table was a fold-out from the armrest and not the standard seat-back tray table. This way, I didn't have to worry about someone leaning back in their seat and spilling my drink. 

* Little niceties like ceramic cups for coffee, cloth napkins, hot towel, and a little tablecloth for the fold out table. 

* Extra pockets in the seat back - gave me a place to park my Kindle and phone while I watched IFE on these flights.

* First class lavatory - I didn't use this on either flight, but first class gets its own lav so you don't have to wait and I've heard the amenities are a bit nicer.

All in all, I feel like FC has ruined me for other seating classes. I'm going to try and book a similar package with FC flights on both legs of the trip in the future. All of the other little perks are really nice, but having the extra space is definitely the best reason for me to fly FC."

"2019-08-28 06:15:49"|"Am I in the wrong program?"|"Hello.  I'm happy to have found this subreddit!  I have a new job this year that has me traveling internationally quite a bit.  My company allows me to book business class and since January I've spent about $45K MQD and just became Diamond.  It's been 25 yrs since I was a frequent flyer and I'm awestruck at the complexity and limitations of the skymiles program.   Simple things like an upgrade certificate are NOT simple.  Regional vs continental vs domestic vs US upgrade certs.  Which fares you can and can't use them with.  When you can use them, where you are in priority queue etc. 

Beyond the complexity issue, there is fundamental value to me as a frequent flyer. As a Diamond member, I get complimentary domestic upgrades, but I don't fly domestically so this is of no value, and I get almost nothing for Global flights.  I can get 4 global upgrades which would be nice I guess to move me from Business to First on a partner carrier with a special first class(that's probably not allowed, I don't even know) but I'd like to actually use it for a global trip with my family, but that doesn't work because there are 5 of us and I'd have to buy a fare class that's 50%+ more expensive to be eligible for an upgrade and unless you book 364 days out you are unlikely to find flights with upgrade slots available?

I am flying to Europe with my wife this weekend actually.  We could have purchased ecomomy class ticket for $1100, but had to pay $1700 for a ticket that was eligible to upgrade with miles.  65K points each, each way (not including the inter Europe portion after a connection which is economy) totaling 260K miles.  I have not accumulated enough miles so far this year so we are flying home economy.  You see when you fly partner airlines you get some diminished value of points (don't ask me how this is calculated) and often if you book Delta to Seoul, for example, the fare is $6K for Korean Airlines and $8K for Delta(codeshare with Korean Air)  So the same flight is 40% more booking on Delta vs the partner airline.  I have to do the right thing for my company and book the Korean Air flight, but I get dinged on points?? 

Bottom line....My $45K MQD isnt even enough to get 2 business class upgrade to Europe.  I get no value on my global flights and I'm going to spend about $100K with Delta on flights this year and when I fly to Australia with my family next spring, I'm going to fly economy with another carrier.  I want to be loyal to a carrier!  I will pay extra to my carrier and even do stopovers to stick to a carrier, but Delta is certainly not that carrier for me!

I think maybe I'm with the wrong carrier?  I've been told that United is the better program for international travelers like myself?  I expect their program will be equally complex but hopefully that the benefits will align better with my goals for rewards and be more valuable for the type of travel I do.  I'm planning on doing the status match and moving to United starting in January.  I'd welcome your thoughts."

"2018-03-04 04:04:42"|"An Open Letter Regarding Corporate Social Responsibility"|"To Whom It May Concern:




As regards the current state of affairs in which our collective State/Federal government/s and societal interest groups find themselves, I must say that I am truly not that surprised or unappreciative of the possibilities/opportunities that the political-economic system of the United States now affords us. I refer, of course, to the rising wave of organizational political consciousness that has sprung from some unforeseen depths following the tragic deaths of 17 persons on Feb. 14, 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Highschool in Parkland, Florida. 

This event has once again shaken the American public to depths of despair that are always of the most grievous of magnitudes. And once again, as the people come together to air their grievances publicly, clearly, and loudly to their government officials, they are met with open arms to extensive hearings, platitudes, assurances, and half-hearted measures drug forward and discussed by equally half-hearted legislators. It seems that we are doomed to waiting until the next mass-shooting to give it another shot.

But wait, amidst the dark and bleak routine in which we have found ourselves, something interesting rears its head: economic powerhouses such as Delta Airlines, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, MetLife, Symantec, et al. publicly, perhaps even brazenly, rebuking those who many within their stakeholder groups see as central to the gun crises of the United States. The subject of the collective ire is, who else, but the National Rifle Association (NRA); an organization that has spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars obstructing and repealing legislature aimed at preventing these tragedies and many others like them from happening in the first place. 

Now, this is not some rant about how we ?need to bring down the NRA and those money-grubbing politicians who support them? or anything of the sort. Frankly, I truly cannot blame the NRA membership for exercising their Constitutional Rights to collective reasoning, discussion, and representation (i.e. founding/joining interest groups) and allowing the organization to represent and bargain for them in the political arena. We all have these same Rights as both members of the United States of America as well as the greater human species and we all exercise them to whatever degree we see fit. We honestly cannot begrudge the NRA member for their membership as it is none of our business nor concern why they have entrusted their voice to and provided a platform to the NRA.

Similarly, I cannot blame the companies (and their many predecessors who forged ahead and stood against societal ailments, wrongs, and barriers before them) for doing as they are and removing policies regarding politically contentious/sensitive organizations. As organizations, and people themselves , these companies are exercising their own Rights to express themselves as they see fit.

Some companies, of which Delta  seems to be the most recent and sharply relevant example, experience the costs and penalties associated with breaking the norms and mores of the special interest group?business/economic enterprise?legislative bargaining policy-making dynamic (Figure: 1) that exists in contemporary neoliberal economies. 

Costs come in many forms and can never truly be predicted when an organization takes a risk and publicly acts against a powerful special interest. For some, it means simply losing face in the endless war of public opinion and for others it may mean losing suppliers or a shifting customer base. For some though, that risk results in a not insubstantial and immediate legislative blowback in the form of a $40-million tax break being shredded by Georgia State lawmakers.

This is where things get truly interesting. For, as collaboratively devastating and hopeful as this collective chain of events has been in terms of the ?debate? on guns in the United States, it still wasn?t anything new up to this point. There are serious implications and social precedents being set in this rapidly unfolding story. When legislators decide to throw a thinly-veiled fit and trash an economically feasible and widely-favored proposal over a perceived political opinion/action, they send a dangerous message (read: threat) to any organizations who wish to exercise their right to political speech contrary to larger benefactors.

The legislative response to Delta?s policy change, escalates tensions between legislators and their business-counterparts by drawing a proverbial line in the sand and standing squarely behind a wall of implied-consequence. It is an intriguing and unforeseen move by the legislators and it can truly be interpreted only one way by business leaders: this is the point where conversation ends. Delta Airlines has now become an example of the limits of governmental patience when dealing with organizational speech. 

There is, however, an obvious problem here in that as long as these legislators are acting in their capacities as elected representatives, they are making decisions in the name and interest of their respective constituencies. Their sabre-rattling is therefore that of their voters and we now must ask: who are the constituents of these politicians? Their electorates or their economic benefactors?

And although I don?t truly buy the ?politically divisive nature? argument Delta, you are doing the right thing in instigating a movement to disassociate business interests, legislative organs, and special interest groups in the United States. The fact is that these relationships have just gotten a little too cozy in recent years. Just look at the business-political ?revolving-door? if you aren?t quite sure of the problem. And sure, it is good for them to get along and be friendly, but a good friend also lets you know when something needs to be addressed. In Delta et al.?s public disassociation with the NRA, they are doing just that.

It is my hopes, as well as why I have written this open letter, that this inspires a larger trend among business lobbies. Now that legislators have very openly shown the new game that is to be played, I implore organizations to begin to take similar stands across all industries and socio-political stances. You cannot allow yourselves to be subjected to the will and blackmail of vindictive legislators who act according to those with the largest checkbook. And in the name of ?not taking sides? in the political turmoil of the United States of America, you must openly declare who it is that you are not aligned with. You, and companies like you, are some of the most powerful players in the court of public opinion and it is time you start utilizing that influence.

If this does not sufficiently appeal to your sense of corporate social responsibility, let me offer some economic incentives as well. This is largely a battle of public opinion and as the clever business-people you are, you know that perception is a key driver to profits and long-term economic viability. Understanding and anticipating the needs, wants, and expectations of customers is the name of the game and right now, the public is clearly saying one thing: ?it is time to act on gun safety in the USA.? 

Now while the singular act of removing the NRA discount was largely symbolic and likely will have limited impacts for Delta, it adds to a collection of actions that collaboratively change the image of an organization in the eyes of the public. By working together across industries and contexts, large companies can profit simply by not being a competitor. And while everyone wishes that political stance/affinity wasn?t a primary driver in consumer decisions, we all know that it is. 

Therefore, I think all of us (both organization and consumer alike) should think very long and hard about what the Delta-Georgia-NRA fiasco is telling us about the current state-of-affairs in the legislative halls of the United States of America. Legislators are not only clearly showing their bias, they are openly acting upon it in their capacities as representatives. Meanwhile organizations who appeal to public opinion (inadvertently or otherwise) are publicly chastised for doing so. 

The social context in which this has taken place is definitively tragic. The easily preventable deaths of 17 human beings and the terrorization of countless others should never be the engine by which we achieve legislative change; the fact that we find ourselves in this position again is frankly sickening and that we are still having this conversation is akin to psychological torment. 

Companies: take this opportunity to affect real change across our great country. For those economic conglomerates out there, what benefit do you stand from ?remaining neutral?? 

The root of the problem is systemic. The sickness may be symptomized in the lawmakers, but its causes lie deep within our socio-political cultures and socio-legal structures. And while I am aware of the legal and political implications of limiting political spending (i.e. ?speech? ), we must find ways to make the effects proportionate across parties and stakeholders if we are to maintain the legitimacy of and trust in our governmental processes. The threat of legislative blackmail through virtually unrestricted political spending by disproportionately influential interest groups and PACs is a threat to everyone?s security, well-being, and opportunity.

My flight today was cancelled 3 hours in advance due to equipment issues. I appreciated the advance notice and was actually thinking last night of switching flights and routes today to accommodate my schedule. 

Lo and behold, Delta couldn?t find another flight for me today on their metal and rebooked me on United. I am grateful that they went ahead and did this, don?t get me wrong. 

My issue is that I always pay for Comfort+ and had received an upgrade to first class, as usual, 5 days prior, however when Delta rebooked me on United, I was put in the last row of coach, middle seat, for an east coast to west coast 6.5 hour trip. I called Delta and was told that their carriage contracts with their customers and with the other airlines only requires a seat, not class accommodation when receiving a courtesy rebooking. I could care less about losing the upgrade but at 6? tall I wanted the class of service I paid for. I searched United and they were selling Economy+ seats so availability wasn?t an issue. 

Never have I been rebooked on another carrier?s equipment so this was a brand new experience for me. 

Also, since I am TSA PreCheck, but not enrolled with United, I was also to use the regular security lanes and strip down and empty briefcase and toiletries, etc. a major inconvenience for me plus having to wait in a long line. 

Interested if anyone has had a similar experience or am I a whiny entitled Diamond member? ??

"2019-07-22 20:09:33"|"Delta says the next big battle between airlines will take place on the ground"|"* **Recent profits and a strong U.S. economy are giving airlines the opportunity to invest more in the airport experience.**
* **Many airports are setting new monthly passenger records.**
* **Delta thinks it can get a leg up on the competition as the edge on fares and in-cabin services becomes more limited.**

&#x200B;

 [*https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/delta-says-next-big-battle-between-airlines-will-be-on-the-ground.html*](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/delta-says-next-big-battle-between-airlines-will-be-on-the-ground.html) 

 

The airline industry is experiencing strong financial performance ? [Delta Air Lines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DAL) recently hit a record stock price, and [United Airline Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UAL) grew profits in its latest earnings as the U.S. economy continues its decade-long run.

In fact, airline industry conditions are so good, longtime airline-stock hater Warren Buffett of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BRK.A) became one of the sector?s biggest investors in recent years after a wave of consolidation brought the fleets closer to the almost monopoly conditions he looks for in businesses.

But other recent highs in air travel are not so positive: Airports all over the country are setting new records in monthly passenger levels, making the?airport experience one of the worst ?legs? in a traveler?s journey. As a result, major airlines flush with money for reinvestment are making the on-the-ground experience a greater focus of their efforts to out-compete rival carriers.

?I think the next area of competition in air travel is in the airport,? Paul Jacobson, executive vice president and CFO of Delta said at the [CNBC @Work Human Capital + Finance conference](https://www.cnbc.com/work/) in Chicago last Tuesday. ?How do you continue to streamline the on-the-ground experience. It is a big part of how passengers rate the experience.?

In major metro areas the two biggest issues in airport satisfaction are access to the airport (with so many major airports far from city centers) and the terminal itself, at No. 1, according to J.D. Power.

?The most common PR headline from any airport any month is ?X airport sets new monthly passenger record,?? said Mike Taylor, J.D. Power?s travel practice leader.

But that does not necessarily mean it is good PR with so many airports so dated.

 

There are some aspects of the airport experience that airlines can?t do anything about. Only 6% more airports have been built in the U.S. since 1980, despite 181% more domestic passengers.

?They can?t build another four-lane highway to the airport,? Taylor said. ?Most of the airports are shoehorned into areas never meant to handle this much traffic.?

Those problems don?t end once at the airport, either: Many parking lots closest to terminals at some of the busiest U.S. airports are now completely full and closed on multiple days per week. This is the type of on-the-ground frustration that leads to missed flights, and missed flights lead to the blame being placed all around.

?People are more stressed on the airport and airlines side of things, and they blame both,? Taylor said.

For the airlines like Delta, it does not matter that some of the terminal experience is beyond their control. Taylor said that when an aircraft closes and sits on the ground because the FAA is holding them there, passengers do not complain about the FAA. ?They paid the airline, and they pick up the cocktail napkin and swear at it.?

Scott Mayerowitz, executive editorial director of travel information site The Points Guy, said the airport experience is unique in the travel journey as being so bad, and it is an important part of the journey that is underexamined. ?Until my head hits the pillow in a hotel room, I am on the go, and it all matters,? Mayerowitz said.

Delta is collecting as much data as it can from passengers to improve the travel experience. [?We survey everything,?](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/whats-the-most-stressful-part-of-your-trip-delta-wants-to-know.html) Jacobson told those attending the CNBC event in Chicago. ?A lot of that comes down to the psychology of the customer and understanding what each leg in the journey makes the customer feel like.?

## Wall Street is watching

Wall Street is focusing more on the airport experience in its analysis of airline stocks. Hunter Keay, a Wolfe Research analyst who covers Delta, wrote that the Delta CFO is correct in his focus on the airport as a competitive key. Keay wrote in a late 2018 research note that Delta?s major investment in ?investment-starved airports? like New York City?s LaGuardia ?are not so much an act of generosity but a strategic decision that we believe will further widen DAL?s competitive advantage to peers by driving up costs for marginal competitors there that lack scale, pricing power, or both. ... This is literally a 20-year competitive advantage DAL is building today, arguably the hardest one yet for competitors to copy.?

Delta is investing $12 billion over a five-year period investing in its airport infrastructure, primarily at New York City?s LaGuardia, Los Angeles International, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

?Airports have always been a challenge for airlines who haven?t been able to crack that code due to more pressing capital needs internally, fear of committing to longer-term, big dollar projects due to business cycle risk with questionable balance sheets, or the challenges of driving buy-in or consensus with the government agencies that run these airports. But it seems to us that DAL is figuring this thing out,? Keay wrote.

One of the terminal chokepoints where Delta made an investment is through a stake it owns in biometric screening company Clear. Jacobson pointed to the Clear investment as part of its efforts to streamline the passenger experience through investments in technology. ?We?ve made big bets in technology in the past few years thinking we can turn it around into revenue generation,? the Delta CFO said at the CNBC event. Jacobson said technology like Clear should ultimately improve the experience beyond the security checkpoint.

?I think ultimately the technology around identification, whether facial recognition or fingerprints, is coming to all transactions,? Jacobson said.

?Delta has recognized that security is a horrible headache for people,? Mayerowitz said. ?[Clear is at many more airports](https://www.clearme.com/where-we-are/?p=GOOGBRAEX&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwmtDpBRAQEiwAC6lm4_5SRPJeH1iXNFpzLmr3hK4Db775gDPmp55sLlbhgVcATBnYKT0vjxoCr-EQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) than before because of the Delta investment, and they?ve done saturation at their key hubs. ?

Mayerowitz, who is a Clear member, added, ?In two to three minutes at LGA or JFK, I can make it from the curb to the other side of security. Clear gets me to the front of the precheck line, and I just put my bag in and walk through and I?m done.?

## The timing is right for airlines

A focus on future revenue is one of the reasons why Delta is making the investments now, before a recession hits and operating conditions weaken.

Yael Taqqu, a senior partner at management consultant McKinsey, who spoke on a panel with Jacobson at CNBC?s @Work Human Capital + Finance conference, said investments like the ones Delta is making now are designed to be ?revenue enhancements? out ahead of the next downturn. ?In a downturn, the wedge between digital haves and have nots, which is already wide, will get wider,? said Taqqu.

Taylor said the timing is right from an airline industry perspective too. ?You have to have three things happen to really expand airports. The economy has to be good, the airline has to be making money, and policies have to be right. These days, we have all three of them working in the airlines favor. ... When they are not making money, those things get put on hold. They would like to have everything set up for the passenger to be happy before getting on the craft.?

Airlines also are running out of ways to improve and ?disaggregate? ? price-tier ? the in-cabin experience.

?Right now airlines have healthy profits and are reinvesting,? Mayerowitz said. ?Delta likes to brag that they have the most inflight seatback TVs of any airline, and they?ve built a business around what they say is a superior product in the sky, and it commands a revenue premium, people willing to spend $10-$15 extra. But at the end of the day, there is only so much you can do to increase costs in the sky.? He added of Delta?s focus on the terminal, ?They are right, especially as airlines cram more seats into planes and come up with hideous slim-line bathrooms just so they can get an extra row of seats in.?

Delta is among the airlines that have cut down bathroom size in some cabins to add an extra back row.

Some of the on-the-ground improvements won?t be available to all passengers ? in fact, they are designed to find ways within the terminal to extract greater revenue and reward elite levels of passengers.

?Space dedicated to lounges will continue to grow,? Taylor said. ?They are looking for more space in which to hand out perks and do the same thing as they are doing in the cabin ... and trying to monetize some of it.?

Mayerowitz, who holds 19 credit cards offering access to many different terminal lounges, said that frequent flyers need better club options because classic lounges at big city terminals can often be ?packed.?

Lounge investment is not limited to the airlines. [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AXP) has its own series of luxury lounges for elite car holders, the Centurion Lounge. ?Centurion has really upped the game in design and food offering,? Mayerowitz said.

Airlines including American Airlines and United (Polaris Lounge) have added multiple-tiers of lounges in addition to the classic options (e.g. AA?s Admirals Club).

?The lounge is crowded for most of these airlines and they are trying to differentiate it. ... If you?re paying $10,000 for a one-way flight, you better be getting something better than a $450 traveler on the same trip. That?s why they have separate entrances for check in,? Mayerowitz said. He added that international travel already features some of these perks, but a passenger flying domestic will has not historically seen this level of service except to limited cross-country routes.

Luxury perks also have extended to travel between terminals. United offers Mercedes Benz cars for elite passengers that need to transfer between terminals for ground connections, a perk that Mayerowitz says can make quite an impression. ?Elite members are whisked in these luxury cars around big planes to their next flights.?

Delta offers Porsches; [American Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAL) uses Cadillacs.

All the airlines will spend ?multi billions of dollars,? in all, Taylor said.

Better food offerings and private dining on demand for top-tier travelers is coming. ?Why have cheese cubes and crackers at the lounge when you can pay for fresh made?? Mayerowitz said. His credit card collections makes sure he always has options and he is seeing more of the benefits as lounges improve.

?I was just in Las Vegas and went to a lounge, got in thanks to my Chase Sapphire Reserve card, and it was great. Nice views and good snacks and a perfect place to unwind before heading out on the next part of my journey.?

But there are limits to how far the airport improvement era can take the passenger.

Mayerowitz is not getting his hopes up too much. ?Airports are just pretty bus terminals. There is only so much you can do.?"

Hoping to catch the attention of someone at Delta Airlines for an answer here as calling customer service was ineffectual to say the least..

I have for the last week now been receiving text messages from a message service alerting me of either gate changes or ETDs for various flights leaving LGA Terminal C

&#x200B;

I have not been to New York in close to 10 years and haven't flown since October of last year to Denver and that was on United I am not sure when the last time I even flew on a Delta flight tbh.  I seem to be getting a decent amount of them so either someone has entered in my number erroneously or my identity has/is compromised.

I have no confirmation numbers or anything other than a few flight numbers and gate/terminal numbers.  The texts come from the number 245-28 which brings up nothing on any search I do so I have no idea what ""service"" to call.

I called Delta customer service and they informed me they cannot look up my phone number in such a manner in the system and I was promptly forwarded a few times to various departments only to start over again at the beginning of the phone tree.  I tried again, was told the same info from another CS employee.

&#x200B;

I figure I could text STOP but may want to use the service myself if I ever find myself flying Delta in the future.  Really just hoping to find a way to see if someone else is using my number (maybe they would also like it corrected to receive the text?) or to verify someone isn't using my phone number in some nefarious manner that could come back to haunt me later.

&#x200B;

Does anyone in redditland know if there is a way for me to  figure this out?  I would greatly appreciate any serious thoughts here."

We always fly Delta, but they don't seem to fly to the remote village she needs to go to (Kotzebou, AK). Looks like only 3 airlines fly in there - and the only one I've heard of is Alaska.

Is there any way we can make it most of the way on Delta? I'd hate to book multiple tickets and then due to a delay miss a connection in Fairbanks, but the alternative seems to be going United all the way.

Any thoughts/suggestions?"
"2018-08-15 10:11:48"|"An update to my months old post, AKA why i just book delta now"|"So a couple months ago I posted here about trying to get my wife to Kotzebue, Alaska for her artist residency. (https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/8d2fg6/flying_to_the_middle_of_nowhere_alaska/)

Delta doesn't fly there so there were good suggestions about just booking a big layover in anchorage. Unfortunately that didn't work out as she needed to be ASAP after alaska in a wedding. So we ended up booking a united flight. 

On the way out it was delayed, I was on hold for 45 minutes only to get told I had to contact a partner airline of united. That seemed odd. But I called them, only to have them tell me that since United owned the ticket they couldn't do anything.

Another 45 minutes on hold and we were finally able to rebook my wife to a flight some 12 hours later.

Now, right before she's scheduled to fly back she get's a google alert saying her departing leg is canceled. No word from united on her overall ticket. I call them and wait 45 minutes on hold. They say that it's not their problem, since it's a carrier out of alaska. I remind them they own the ticket, so they need to make it work.

After another hour(!) on hold they tell me they've rebooked her but she's going to have to leave 12 hours early and is getting in to the next city she's traveling to over 16 hours early. And they won't give her a hotel voucher.

I told the CS agent that I was texting with my wife and that she wasn't happy. The United CS agent said that at least they were getting her out of Alaska.

All in all, a terrible performance from United. So why am I posting this on the Delta subreddit?

Well I told the CS agent that we usually fly delta, and only because Delta didn't fly to the middle of nowhere Alaska we ended up booking United. She said ""well if your wife knew what  we spent to rebook her she'd be a fan of us"".

Such garbage. We just booked two more fall trips through delta. Thanks for the great customer service, delta! You don't make loyal customers when everything goes great, it's how you deal with adversity. And that's why I book Delta even if it's a bit more."

Darn, but as it was my first attempt, I'm not totally heartbroken.  However my heart is really set on working with American Airlines as a flight attendant, and I totally plan on applying again when the next opportunity arises, but I need to look at my other options as well. What can I do in the meantime? 

&#x200B;

I'm definitely applying for other airlines and keeping an eye out for when Delta and United start hiring (for more than just a bilingual position). I have no experience as a flight attendant, and find myself wondering if I could get experience with another airline - would that make me more desirable as an applicant? Since Mesa airlines have a partnership with American and United is there a possibility of that being a good step in the door? 

&#x200B;

Or would it maybe be better to go another route by applying for a different Job with American? Getting my name and work ethic out there and known within the company, and so when there's later on a chance to apply for my desired job they know who I am, and I am doing so internally. I see that they have a Customer Assistance Representative position open, and as I have several years of customer service under my belt this wouldn't be a hard jump to make.

I would greatly appreciate your expertise and advice as professionals in the field. :)

My plan was to apply for these companies in the fall when (I thought...) the three applications would all open at around the same time, but United just opened, so I have slightly less time than I thought to mull this all over. 

Questions I have:

1. Differences between Delta, American, and United I should consider in choosing? (Salaries, Unions, Scheduling, Time off, etc and more I wouldn't think of yet)
2. Benefits of Unionizing vs not (as I know Delta is not unionized)
3. Which airline would it be easiest to get a base out of California with? (I am definitely willing to move, but if I can be based in CA with easier access to friends and family that would be the dream.) 
4. I am a German major, and have fairly high conversational German, though I hesitate to call myself fluent- Is it worth trying to apply as Language of Destination/Bilingual? Can I apply to both bilingual and normal positions, or do I only get one application per airline?
5. (United Specific) The application for United that just opened is showing for Chicago- would it be basically guaranteed I would be placed in Chicago (initially at least)? 
6. Odds of starting out with international flights rather than domestic? (I am an International Studies major and dying to get back out into the world again:) 
7. Anything I should do to bolster my application/resume?

After realizing there were two, it stated not to apply to different positions while one is active otherwise I might get disqualified. Am I at a disadvantage for not applying for the more specific app?

\- Is it common to not get a VI request? I'm going straight F2F. The Job listing is maybe 2 weeks old tops and they mentioned training beginning late March/early April. Could [this article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-united-airlines-employees-selling-travel-perks-fired-20190307-story.html) have anything to do with it?

"2018-08-22 20:08:49"|"Tips and Tricks to Get Through"|"Everyone keeps wanting to know the same questions, so here is my summary as best as I can get. I have posted this before in and out of other comments, and hopefully this will narrow it down and help you. I applied to 4 regionals, got 3 interviews, (one I later declined), and got both offers from the ones I interviewed with. The one regional I didn't get was because I have more than 5 jobs in 5 years, and a non-visible tattoo. So, here is my thoughts to help you:

1. If you are serious about being an FA, it might take you a year or more to get through several applications before being hired. I strongly recommend you take any medical classes like 'First Aid' or 'Basic CPR' to add to your application. (both are generally one day classes and not expensive) Airlines seem to all screen for medical and fine dining backgrounds. I was an Emergency Medical Technician, and for whatever reason, it was on every application I did and helped me get through. Also, any high end waiter jobs are also VERY helpful as is bartending. Avoid having 'too many jobs' hurt me.  **** Before even applying, know the height requirements and tattoo policy. If you are too short or too tall or have a large visible tattoo you will immediately be cut. Don't even apply and go through the process as it's a waste of your time. **** Have a MATCHING passport and state ID. We had one applicant have a married name on her papers, but her maiden name on her passport and she was going to be cut. She could prove she applied for an updated passport and made it through barely. Make sure your stuff matches.

2. Have to do a video interview? Here is what you should know. Most video interviews are of you, answering a question in under a minute from your laptop or cell phone. Some you can do over and over until you get it right. I would actually set up a test ahead of time. Use your laptop camera and video yourself against a solid wall background. Wear a blazer and shirt, and make sure the audio is clean and clear. When doing your videos, avoid 'uh's and 'um's. Speak very slowly and also if you can, write down common phrases ahead of time and sprinkle them into your video interview. Things like 'I am a great candidate for your airline because I am on time, work efficiently, and am perfect at solving customer issues to retain customer loyalty."" Sprinkle educated phrases like this ahead to seem smart and confident. Anytime you can throw in '..helping you make an informed, intelligent decision about hiring me...' goes a long way. 

3. Going to your face to face? YAY! Here is what you should know. 

(A) If you are male, shave. No beards, hipster stuff, earrings, rings, tattoos, or anything that makes you who you are. Your goal is to look like a conservative bank teller. If you are a lady, dress conservative also, no wisps of hair in your face. use lots of spray and hair gel or product and tie your hair back in a bun. Hair should be off of the neck. I think if you have braids/dreads as long as it's tied back you should be ok. No black lipstick. No dangly earrings or anything like that. Google bank teller and that's what you want to look like. Dark blazers, dark pants. Conservative. Look the part. No hipster rings on your hands, or funky watches. One ring. One watch. Maybe a bracelet but I would avoid it. 

(B). Pick your favorite paragraph from your favorite book. Stand in front of a mirror. Try and smile and read it aloud. Read it very very slowly. You will be nervous when you do it, and so your brain will want to read fast, so read slow so it sounds normal when you do it. During the interview, you will be handed a safety paragraph you will be expected to read loudly. Smile, read it aloud slowly. You may be in front of a hundred people, so I hope you are confident in being in front of lots of people. I watched an applicant get up in front of a hundred people, freeze up and cry. Don't be that applicant.

(C) Customer turnaround. Know a well thought out story about a time when you turned around an angry customer into a happy one. Be able to smile as you are saying it, and get it to about a minute long. No 'um's or 'uh's. Speak slow, and with purpose. Pretend you are a stand up comedian in that you should be active, command attention, even talk with your hands if need be. If you stand up like a frozen nervous lump, you will get cut. I actually wrote mine out so I could practice ahead of time and could recite it reasonably well. 

(D) Interview. Mention in the interview how much fun it was to learn CPR and First Aid, and how fascinated you are in learning safety procedures aboard Aircraft. Try and slip it in there when they ask you why you feel you are a great candidate. It might help you get through it. Avoid cliche stuff like 'I'm great with people'. Instead say things like 'I am a master at creating dynamic solutions on the fly to help solve issues angry customers face'. They will look for steps to turn an angry customer, like 'Listen, empthathize, apologize, and propose a solution. (L.E.A.P.)

(E) RESEARCH your airline. I guarantee they will ask you 'What do you know about us?'. Go to the airline's website and know that they operate a fleet of 150 jets and fly to over 180 US Destinations plus Canada and the Caribbean. Know they have about 5,000 employees. Know they have 5 US Bases.

(F) If they ask you if you will relocate, ALWAYS say yes. 99.9% of the time you know the base you are hired for so you know where you have to move to. You can always decline later if you are about to start training and feel you don't want to relocate. 

4. Pay. Before you even apply, make sure you have two full months of money set aside as most training is not paid. Regional training is 4 weeks and up to two weeks for your 3-day initial operating experience. This means it can be two full months before getting a paycheck. Also, $18/flight hour is NOT $18/hr but rather about $9/hr. You don't do this for the money. Regional Airlines like Compass/Endeavor Air/SkyWest/PSA/CommutAir are domestic and fly from Canada to the Bahamas. Mainline such as Delta/American/United fly internationally and can pay as much as $28/flight hour, which is substantially more. Know the money and the facts before.

Anyways, this is my summary so far. I may edit it in the future, but I hope this helps all of you get through and join me in the air. Best of luck!"

As this has been a lifelong dream, I'm obviously over the moon about the chance to work for United and live the dream. Here's my personal concern; I applied for this job many many months ago, before I met my amazing partner. In the middle of making many plans for travel and growth in our future, I received the email from United that I got a F2F interview. My partner was, of course, so incredibly supportive in so many ways I could have never imagined. I got the job (!!!!) and he's maintained the viewpoint of ""I'm all in, I will do whatever it takes to make this work, we'll take it one day at a time, I will need communication...etc etc""

But what I'm wondering is, how taxing is it REALLY to have your partner back in your hometown, while you are flying and relocated. (Before/if they join you is different, I'm sure, but until that point....) I'm scared to lose the person I love over the love for the lifestyle I've always dreamed of. I want to know what it's truly like to be on the move, and if those relationships really work.

Per diem will not be included as the federal government does not recognize it as income. Just to add, an average per diem may be  $1.75/250hrs a month to equal around 437.50 a month.

In this scenrio we will be using the 11 days off and 80hrs of pay a month.

In theory, if I omit I have such a tattoo will either of these airlines find out if I conceal it well, while it is getting removed? Do they have someone inspect you body to look for visible tattoos?
I know it might sound like the wrong thing to do, to lie about it but I am in the process of getting it removed so it won't be there in a few months I believe. Thanks for reading.

So to make this as short as possible: I have a BA and I applied to United and AA as a bilingual candidate late March/early April, I don't remember the exact date. I got video interviews for both within a week of each other. And within a week of each other I got very generic ""you haven't been selected"" e-mails. 

Notes: 1) I have short hair that's not quite to my shoulders. Didn't pin it back. Mistake?
2) I don't wear make up at all, so I didn't for either video. Mistake?

I also don't have exactly customer service experience but I tried to spin my job, I work in home healthcare, as such. Is this also hurting me? I was kinda expecting it for AA because I got really nervous and stumbled over my words, had to pause for a good 5-10 seconds. United I felt miles better about though, so it's a bummer as this is really something I want to do.

I'm going to apply to Delta-- I think it opens in June?-- and would love some insight if I made some critical mistakes. Also, no amount of googling answers my question: when United/AA open again (when?) can I immediately apply again? 

And how do I find out which companies are hiring when?

This is mostly because I want to work my way into the international routes. Might be a hot topic but any opinions on these three and where they rank internally?

To be completely honest I've based my past  jobs around this dream to gain experience. I've worked in nothing but customer service since I was 15. Food/retail and a five star hotel. I worked a stint as a TSA officer so I know most of the safety rules for airlines on the ground and a basic understanding of air safety as well as the unseen dangers FAs face.

I was embarrassed to say it at one point but I've had three F2F with AA. 2 with Delta. 2 with United. Then a few regional group interviews. But the more I see how competitive it is I have just been working on myself. I'm independent but I do have moments where I am more reserved. I also have a very hard time bragging on myself. I'm confident but its awkward to sell myself just because of the way I was raised. (Always taught to be extremely humble). I feel like I always undersell myself. I've been getting farther and farther the last few though.

"2017-10-24 02:58:36"|"Question for current flight attendants"|"I have a question for some existing flight attendants.

I used to be a flight attendant for a regional airline for a few months back in 2012. I was fresh out of college and had dreams of being a flight attendant. The airline had a newer crew base where I lived, so I figured it was a perfect fit. The base was only open for a few months and then the base was terminated. I was informed that all of us would have to relocate to the IAD base. I had some personal family health issues and I was not in a spot in my life where I felt comfortable enough to relocate. The company literally only gave us a week to relocate before the base shut down. I ultimately decided to quit. I did not give the appropriate two weeks before leaving and therefore am not eligible for rehire.

I received my FAA flight attendant certificate in September 2012. I have applied for both mainline Delta and United?s flight attendant openings recently.  I do not list the regional on my resume because I feel that would only hinder my chances when they see I was a flight attendant for only a few months. 

I interviewed with mainline American about a year after I left the regional and actually got to the f2f and actually got pulled aside with a few other people to speak with additional airline representatives after they escorted a large group out. The reps asked more detailed questions about my experience at the regional and also my reasoning for leaving. I was very honest with them. After, I was very confident and thought that I had it, but ultimately got a tbnt email about a week later. 

I feel that being open about my experience and my ineligibility to be rehired definitely hurt my chances with American.

Regardless of listing the regional on my application, I am still searchable on the FAA website.  My question is, If anything did happen with Delta or United and I passed training, would already being in the FAA Database and not mentioning my previous experience be enough for them to rescind a job offer?

Any input is appreciated! Thanks!"

A little larger than a quarter, smack on the back of my neck. It can be hidden with a neck scarf and my hair (which is a tad past my shoulders, maybe an inch, and can be nicely pinned back out of my face with Bobby pins). 

If they ask if I have any visible tattoos, do I tell them they are covered and not visible while in uniform?

This is my third face to face with a major airline in the last 6 months. United did not ask about my tattoo during the F2F, and neither did Delta. I do not want to spend 400 dollars removing my tattoo if I don?t have to- especially if I?m going to be supporting myself for 7 weeks with no pay.

"2019-07-07 21:22:16"|"Flight cancelled with AA, found another on Delta and AA won't help. Need to vent."|"My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

&#x200B;

I realize that Southwest was considered one of the ""good ones,"" but I'm now shopping for a new airline. I fly between Dallas and DC 25+ times a year for work.

I recently learned that the appointment I have to attend to is at 11:00 AM instead of PM.

Since I?m just a single person, it seems like there?s a high probability of me finding an available spot at an earlier time. I?ve never done a Same Day Flight Change before and I?m wondering if anyone here knows about it, specifically for United Airlines.

"2019-08-31 23:51:21"|"Unable to choose seats on my ANA flight (flight cancellations involved)"|"Hi people!

I am afraid of the response I may receive here but would like to double check anyway in case of any new ideas you may come up with. My situation is the following:Originally booked the following route through ANA website and paid for it directly to them (including prepaid seat reservation of 50 USD so I could ensure 2 window seats in the twenty-something rows of the plan as I had originally wanted it):

\- Buenos Aires - NYC (United)- NYC - Tokyo - NYC (ANA)- NYC - Buenos Aires (United)

All was fine with seat reservation as I wanted, until United chose to discontinue their Buenos Aires - NYC route 2 weeks ago. Because of this problem (including not being able to visit NYC when we wanted, having our route changed), we went to United Airlines offices in our city (ANA local offices said they could not help us unfortunately) and they issued new flights, going through Houston instead of NYC, without additional costs (and these included Buenos Aires - Houston - Buenos Aires flights by United + Houston to Tokyo and back in ANA flights).

When we went back home with our new tickets, we were shocked to discover that even though the new flights were now present in my web reservation (in ANA.com) we had been put in the last seats of the plane (seats in rows 41/42 basically) for each leg between Houston and Tokyo, next to the bathroom + food carts, which was not at all what I expected, and less so after having paid for a prepaid seat reservation fee with my initial purchase. After this, I contacted ANA local offices again, they said they could not help so I called ANA in the USA (with the high costs involved) 3 different times + United local offices several times, without success in obtaining better seats. While ANA USA tells me that because United booked these new flights (which are indeed ANA own flights...) they have no power at all to change my seat reservation, When I speak with United, they tell me that it is an ANA flight and that they cannot do anything about it....

So, basically, even though having bought the flights initially through ANA website, paid for prepaid reservation fees to get the seats I wanted (plus booking almost 8 months in advance to ensure I got those seats), I am now left with the worst seats of the plan without any possible solution I can think of.

Do you know what else I could do? Any recommendations as to how to proceed?

"2016-04-17 10:10:15"|"Did I mess up?"|"Hello, I was looking for tickets for the longest time ever through Google Flights, and I had been recently tracking the ones I liked. This time around I really was looking to buy the cheapest tickets. Today I decided to buy one and the only option to buy it was through United website where I went and tried to purchase, however, no matter what I did it just gave me an error and I decided to call United where I was told they do not service Google Flights...

So, I then went on looking for more tickets and I had found something through Hipmunk, for even cheaper than what I found on Google Flights. Then it took me to a website called ExploreTrip that is where I checked the flights once again and then inputted all my info and (bought?) the ticket, I then received an Itinerary from them stating all the flights I picked and I thought that it was way too easy and then I started questioning where do I see the confirmation of the flights, choose seats and so on. I tried to go back to the website, but on their main page all you could do is search for more flights and some contact information.

So, I started googling the website and got upon multiple bad reviews and red flags saying that the service is bad, where people had bought the ticket and then were told that it was canceled, credit cards charged multiple times, the list goes on... At that moment my soul just dropped deep down low to my heel. I started panicking a little and called that company right away where I was greeted by a customer rep with a fairly difficult to understand accent. I told him my order # and so on, and asked him to confirm that I indeed got the tickets and how where I go about picking the seats. The rep sent me a confirmation email saying that the tickets did go through, this time the Itinerary had more information with PER-FLIGHT order number. My entire trip was to go through United Airlines, Swiss and Lufthansa. So I picked my first flight which was through United AL, and checked the flights status on their official website, and to my surprise everything seemed fine, it right away popped all of my flights at once which was a slight relief.

Am I tripping out too much? Am I actually fine? What could I do to further confirm that yes, that indeed everything went through just fine and so on, since the price was a little too hard to believe. I was also able to choose the seats for some flights too. How could I make sure that I was not scammed? How can I be sure that I won't get told that my ticket doesn't work upon registering for the flight at the time and day of the flight?"

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

I got an email from Lufthansa this morning saying ""Dear Passenger, As you are affected by a flight irregularity on your flight connection from TULSA OK to FLORENCE IT, we have made the following changes to your itinerary."" the changes actually keep my flights/arrival time about the same, it's just my departure is tomorrow instead of today. Also, while I have the same return flight as before, my flights to Italy are through completely different airlines (American and Swiss International instead of United and Lufthansa) and my layovers are in Chicago (stateside) and Zurich (in Europe) instead of Houston/Hamburg.

I'm pretty excited and a bit nervous as this is my first solo, international flight. One thing that's bugging me is whether I have to grab my bags after every connecting flight. I've had connecting flights before but they were all domestic and usually with the same airline, so I never had a second thought about it. But now that I'm throwing in an international flight plus with multiple airlines I'm a bit puzzled and worried. 

From Grand Rapids to Chicago, I'm taking United. From Chicago to Toronto, I'm using Air Canada. From Toronto to Quebec City, I'm using Air Canada again. Do I have to grab my back when I land in Chicago and go through the same process again because of the change in airlines? How about when I land it Canada because of the whole customs thing?

> Please call us. 
> We are trying to reach you with an important message regarding your upcoming United flight(s).

The confirmation number is the right one; the phone # at least [seems to be legit](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/united-airlines-mileageplus/1647821-check-your-ua-itineraries-schedule-changes-what-do-after-one-archive-73.html).

The whole idea struck me as strange and I dropped the call, suspecting a scam -- but checking the United website, I realized that the forward leg had indeed disappeared.

What are my options, and what is the best one? Can I just cancel the back leg as well and work with another carrier? (I could even try booking the same flight through Lufthansa, if it doesn't fall afoul of Fly America.) Is it normal for them to just cancel my booking? I don't have a ticket, just a ""printer-friendly purchase confirmation""; one thing that *might* have happened is that my script blocker has somehow messed up the booking process.

"2017-11-10 22:28:58"|"Advice on United nonrev (standby) travel from Colorado to Japan last week of March?"|"Hey there, /r/Flights!


I am planning a two week trip to Japan, flying from DEN to NRT on March 24th and coming back on April 9th. In order to make the best use of my time, I chose the non-stop United 143 & United 142 respective outbound and return flights (about $1900).


However, I have an awesome family member that works for United and offered to add me to his buddy list for this flight, which would make the flight about 80% cheaper. This would be a huge savings, but at a risk. For those who don't know, flying on a buddy pass is referred to as a non-revenue ticket or ""nonrev"", meaning the airline doesn't make a profit on it. On a nonrev you fly standby, so there isn't a guarantee that you will have a seat the moment the plane boards. But if there are available seats, any standby passengers get any remaining available seats.


So my question to you all is whether or not I should take the risk of flying standby for the crazy discount. I'm trying to factor in the following:

I'm not flying over a holiday or major festival, even though it seems to be the peak of cherry blossom season and coincides with spring break.

I don't have a hotel reservation I have to stick to (staying with someone I know).

The price of a guaranteed ticket will obviously go up the longer I wait to purchase it, if that's the route I take. For the next few weeks the price shouldn't change, though.

The nonrev ticket price shouldn't change at all, even up until day-of and I don't pay for the ticket if I don't get on the plane.

When I got the offer a week or so ago, I checked on a comparable flight 3 days out on a Saturday and it still had 20+ seats available. If I am really traveling during a not busy time, the same should hold true - [this blog post appears to support the idea](http://www.clearedlist.net/fly-standby-april/).


I'm hoping you fine folks here in /r/Flights will have some good advice for me!"

American Main Cabin Extra (MCE), Delta Comfort Plus (Comfort+), United Economy Plus (Economy+) are economy cabin seats with some enhancements, they are not comparable to true premium economy service from airlines such as BA or Lufthansa.

In the last year we have seen several corporations convert from Premium Economy services on European airlines to Economy Plus on American airlines based on ""better pricing"". This is a downgrade. These services are not equal, American MCE can't compare to BA World Traveller Plus, United EconomyPlus can't compare to Lufthansa Premium Economy.

Unfortunately, this is catching out many unfamiliar corporate travellers who are not aware these Economy Plus seats are vastly inferior with much reduced leg room and seat width as well as regular Economy food and drink.

If you do have any say in choosing between these services or influencing your corporate travel agreements, please compare products directly rather than assuming equivalence from names.

Although I always remind any personal travelers I am looking after, not all agents are doing this as our commission is fee and not based on price, so personal travelers used to European standards are also being disappointed after flying the American choices."

My family is excited to meet their grandson/nephew. They live in New York.

I'm trying to figure out the best option for them to travel out here since we can't say for sure when the baby will arrive. They can't stay indefinitely as everyone needs to minimize time off work. Here are some options I've already explored through American and United:

1. Buy a fully refundable ticket. This is absurdly expensive; it's cheaper to just buy a last-minute ticket.

2. Buy a last-minute ticket. Obviously better than option 1, but this still runs about $700 per round trip ticket. Yikes.

3. Buy tickets now and hope the baby comes on time. But changing flights incurs a $200 fee plus the difference in airfare, which is more than option 2.

4. Use rewards miles to buy them tickets now. If they have to change flights, I'd only need to make up the difference in mileage required. So if I get my mom a ticket for Nov 5 for 15K miles and my gf goes into labor on Nov 1 and a last minute ticket is 20K miles, I'd just have to fork over the additional 5K miles. But I can't make up the difference in cash, so if I don't have enough miles (like if the last minute ticket is 75K miles), then I can't do anything about it. And if she doesn't end up using the Nov 5 flight at all, I have to pay a fee of $150 to reclaim those miles or I forfeit them.

5. Use trip insurance. Buy separate flights for Nov 1, Nov 6, and Nov 11. If the baby doesn't arrive by Nov 1, cancel that flight and eat the insurance (like $50). And then repeat for the second flight, and definitely fly the third (baby can't come much later than that). The only problem is the fine print on those insurance policies; I think you can only cancel your trip if you have qualified excuses like a medical problem, etc. How stingy are airlines about using the insurance? Can you just say, ""Hey, I'm not taking this flight"", and they just say, ""You have insurance, so no worries."" This plan also requires laying out money for three flights, but that's what credit cards are for, I guess.

Does anyone have any better ideas? It doesn't seem right that families should have to choose between paying triple the normal cost of a flight or meeting their grandchild. They used to offer bereavement fares, but apparently those are gone now. I was hoping there was something similar for births. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

The situation: I work in London, but have been invited to interview for a couple of PhD positions in California. The interviews are a couple of weeks apart, so I can?t batch them into one trip (and I?m not allowed to take more than four consecutive days off from work anyway). As a result, I?ll be making two rapid-fire trips from London to California and back (2.5 days on the ground for the first, 1.5 days for the second). I?ve never flown so far before, so I?m quite nervous.

Complications: I need to be performing as highly as possible for the interviews of course, and fully functioning at work the morning after I get back from each trip. (Otherwise it counts as taking additional unapproved holiday time.) These two trips take up all of my accrued holiday, and my company can?t know about these interviews, so I?m not able to extend either trip. The universities will only pay for the basic economy fare, and I?m just not able to cover the increase in fare for premium economy myself (+?1100/$1500 for the first trip alone), so I?m stuck in coach. I?m worried about seat width as I am fairly tall (5?11?). I only have 8kg of luggage allowance. Oh, and I?ve never been able to sleep on planes, not even with heavy-grade sleeping medication. 

(I?m not entirely sure who my first flight is with. I booked it through Austrian, after booking they said it was actually operated by United, and it has a Lufthansa flight number. I plan to call Austrian this weekend to see if I can confirm the underlying airline and get their booking code, and then see if I can upgrade to an exit seat or something.)

So my question is... is this manageable? Or am I a wee bit screwed? 

Specifically:

1. How do I manage such long and densely distributed flights?
2. Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of being alert at the interviews and at work after?
3. Any advice on keeping my luggage under the 8kg? I plan to wear my interview shoes on the plane. 
4. Has anyone else balanced international interviews with a high-pressure job? How did it go?

Thank you!!

Tl;dr: I have two weekend interview trips from London to California coming up this month, and I haven?t flown that far before. What do I do?"

And $800 a ticket when you book the right time for an around the world trip is certainly affordable. Sure if I were to cherry pick flights andd add complications and points of failure I might be able to save $100, but the convenience, comfort, food, and reliability has been top notch since I decided to choose one airline and stick with it."

So, I am flying out to go on vacation with Delta for the first time. I've always flown United, but I wanted to give a new airline a chance at winning me over so I decided to try out Delta. As it happens, I decided to do the ""basic economy"" option because, as a teacher, price is a big deal to me. I knew I wouldn't get to pick a seat till check in, and that is okay, but after getting in I see my flight connecting to the final destination has ""Assign at Gate"" as my seat number, which is... different. I did some google searched, but the results were a little opaque so I wanted to put the question here. 

Should I be scared of Assign at Gate boarding? It says there are 50 seats left, which seems fine, but still... having never flown Delta before this is a little weird.

It's a bit tricky question and all the airlines are giving me generic answers so thought I'd seek some insights here.

My original flight is with Aerlingus from Barcelona to Dublin and to Chicago. My final destination in the US has changed to Austin so I'm now looking at domestic flight from ORD to AUS for next Friday... What I want to do is purchasing a United Arline ticket leaving that night from Chicago to Austin which will only leave me 1 hour and 30 minutes to transfer in Chicago. 

My flight from Dublin to Chicago is co-operated by United with Aerlingus. In the past I have purchased two different United flights AUS - IAD and IAD to DUB under different booking numbers because somehow separating them was cheaper. When I checked in in Austin, the lady found my another booking made under my name and made my final destination to Dublin so I don't have to get my baggage and recheck it in Washington. 

I was hoping somehow I can do this and ask to make my final destination Austin instead of Chicago when I check in in Barcelona but I wonder if it would be doable because it's a different airlines in Barcelona. My US customs will be cleared in Dublin so I don't do that when I land in Chicago but if I have to recheck in would an hour 30 be too short given the fact I'll have to move from Terminal 5 to Terminal 1 to recheck in though it's a domestic flight... Any thoughts?

&#x200B;

So, Ill make a travel to Japan on April from SJO (Costa Rica) to Japan. I have two transfers in the US, specifically, on Houston and later on LAX. This last one is the one I am most concern. 

Im expected to arrive to LAX from Houston  at 23:36 on April 11 and transfer to leave at 00:50  to Japan, therefore, a window  of 1 hour 14 minutes.

Would you consider this is enough time, considering I did migration on Houston already?  Into consideration would be that a person travelling with me doesn't need wheelchairs but it does have to walk at a relative normal to slow pace (basically no rushing). This is what LAX says about the  walking time on their page: [https://www.flylax.com/en/inter-terminal-connections](https://www.flylax.com/en/inter-terminal-connections). Thanks for any input here, basically I'm kinda scared since from past experiences I normally have delays and plus the walking length from United Airlines terminals (terminals 7 - 8) to International, it seems I dont have much of a window, and I would really hate to lose the flight to Japan and miss a day.

&#x200B;

The second, kinda related topic, is that before I had a 1 hour 51 minutes layover but they made a reschedule. Due to this I tried to call and change my flight but they say that the connection is guaranteed and they wont change me to another flight (the option is one that goes out in the early morning from SJO and have considerable more time of layovers in Houston and in LAX). They address that they have the right to change schedules (which i understand and have no issue) but I found that in their page they also say that if they reschedule for more than 30 minutes an arrival or departure time  a change can be made.  [https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/help/faq/schedule-changes.html](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/help/faq/schedule-changes.html)

After prompting this to my local Call center they just insist the first rule the apply is the contract of carriage [https://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/contract.aspx](https://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/contract.aspx)

&#x200B;

Does anyone have had similar experience and is there a possibility to keep asking on higher managers to help reschedule or is a lost cause?

I will try to keep this as brief as possible. In February I booked round trip plane tickets from SJO, Costa Rica to Manado (MDC), Indonesia for a scuba trip in October. I was able to book this entire trip through the United Airlines website. Recently, I decided to use my confirmation number to check on the flights and noticed that my flights from Tokyo to Manado through Jakarta were missing. I double-checked my original email confirmation of the purchase, and everything was there.

After talking to them on the phone, it appears they are unable to confirm my seats for these tickets. Their explanation was that these tickets were through a different airline, and they could not force them to accept my reservation. They never notified me of any issues with my reservation. I coincidentally noticed the problem. Obviously I was a little frustrated, I had imagined booking everything through the United website guaranteed me these seats.

Now they have offered to change my flight to roundtrip to Singapore (free of charge as a courtesy - thanks United) and recommended I book round trip travel for the remaining itinerary on my own through another airline. They are unwilling to offer any additional discount or compensation for the $1200 tickets I will be responsible for.

I can't help but feel like United dropped the ball and are trying to fix their mistake in the cheapest way possible to them. I have heard that there are certain rights for airline travelers but am not sure how they would apply to this specific situation."

I've done some research, but I'm still not entirely sure how this will affect my trip and would appreciate if someone could help clarify a few main points. Primarily:

1. How will this affect my baggage? (ie. will I need to go to baggage claim in LAX and recheck everything in since it will be with different airlines, or can I still have it follow me straight from BNA?)
2. If my BNA -> LAX flight is delayed/canceled (or NRT -> LAX on the return) and I am not able to reach the next flight in time, will the airline(s) still work with me to get me on another flight?
3. Depending on the answers to the previous questions, will a 3 hour layover in LAX be too tight/risky? I don't fly often and I'm not familiar with LAX so I'm hoping someone with some more experience could give some advice.

"2016-10-13 04:11:27"|"How can I get a refund on my ticket?"|"So, here's the story: I bought four tickets for Beijing to Chengdu on Sichuan Airlines, via vayama.com, using my United MileagePlus card. This was for a family trip. 

While in Beijing, my dad got very sick. We took him to the hospital, he got medication, and started on his path to recovery. He went to the hospital the day of our flight, and given that he was very weak and sick, we decided it would be best for him to stay behind in Beijing and not travel on with us. I figured it would be a fairly easy refund with it being medical and all. 

So I reached out to Vayama to ask how to go about getting a refund. Turns out it's more complicated than I imagined- they want all kinds of official documentation, such as a letter from the attending Doctor, on the hospital's official letterhead, explaining that there is no possible way this person could travel with this medical condition, etc. 

And that's *totally* doable that we are going to get that information from a doctor we saw one time in a city we were temporarily in. *rolls eyes*. Plus, given the timing of it, we simply didn't have any time to even collect all this information. Our return flight went Chengdu to Beijing, brief layover in the airport to meetup with my dad, then return flight to the US. 

What's my next possible route for refunding the ticket? I thought that I would be covered with a travel protection plan because I bought it under my MilagePlus card but now I can't seem to find any info regarding travel protection on non-United flights. 

I don't even care if we don't get a full refund, but at least some of the money would be nice to have back. 

Should I just send Vayama the medical documents we have (in Chinese) and see if they will accept it? The thing is, his condition wasn't life threatening, but it was miserable enough that he felt more comfortable staying behind, and I feel like airlines probably don't give a crap about how you feel, but how the doc diagnoses you. 

Anyway, what should I do next? I appreciate your input, especially if anyone can enlighten me on if I have some sort of trip protection through my card. "

I've only flown a scant few times in my life and next weekend I'm going to be flying out on business and during that journey I'll be encountering two firsts - my first layover and my first experience on regional jets.  Both legs of my departing trip will be on United regional carriers.

I'll be departing from Westchester/White Plains via Wisconsin Air and going to O'Hare.  After a 55 minute layover I'll be taking SkyWest to Boise.  What I gather from other posts is that the ""sweet spot"" for domestic layovers is typically an hour, so my 55 minute layover is at least close.

What I'm wondering is about bags.  I know that my bag will not fit in overhead (it is regulation size but not for smaller planes), and even if it did fit, I've never flown United before and do not have priority boarding so I suspect whatever limited overhead capacity there is will be filled up well before I board.

My understanding is that when doing a layover on jetliners they will forward your bags to your final destination, but it sounds like regional planes have you retrieve your bags on the jetway and then take them to your next plane.  If so should I anticipate a potential delay here as if I had to go to baggage?

I guess I'm just trying to plan for any potential problems - a delay in getting to the gate + a bag delay + navigating a very large airport for the first time could mean that 55 minute layover disappears in a hurry.  Unfortunately it seems there are very few direct flights to Boise so I need to make this work or else I think they'll send me on a second connection somewhere.

(Note: My grandma has the same type of bag to stow under the seat, and she is also taking her purse separate, so if this is something to genuinely be concerned about she needs to figure out what she is going to do too.)

I've had no issue with taking more than one ""personal item"" on other airlines with the exact same one-item-per-passenger policy (I actually got away with three different bags on a United flight once), and I understand it varies between airports/employees working at the gate.

I should also add that I have flown Spirit in the past and enjoyed the service, although that time my parents were also driving to our destination with a rental car (and everybody's luggage, so we basically got on the plane with nothing but our phones and wallets/purse) so this wasn't a potential concern then."

One flight that I like (because it doesn't involve connecting in the USA), is Calgary to Vancouver, Vancouver - Brisbane (all aboard the dreamliner!!), Brisbane - Christchurch.

Only issue is that on the way out the flight only has a 55 minute layover in Brisbane. Now, I've done tight connections before in Denver connecting to Vegas with United Airlines, but that was one airline connecting in one terminal. Here's where I'm getting confused, I'm used to flights where if theres a connection or two it's either all one airline, or it's a 'codeshare' flight within Star Alliance. However, in this case, the first two legs of the flight are Air Canada but Brisbane to Christchurch is a Qantas flight which isn't a codeshare and as far as I can find out Qantas isn't part of teh Star Alliance, even though Air Canada is selling it to me as part of one ticket on their website.

So I guess the question is:

If the YVR-BNE leg is delayed somehow causing me to miss the BNE-CHC flight, is Air Canada responsible to get me Christchurch because they sold me the ticket with a 55 minute connection, or am I on my own? "

I've been monitoring the flight over the past few months and the price has been slowing creeping down from the $1400s to the $1300s. I was hoping for it to fall in the $1200s before I bought my ticket. The 3-months-out mark was last Friday and I was holding out to see if there would be a price dip. To my horror, when I checked the flight on Friday it had jumped roughly $700 in price, up to $2049 for the trip! I'm pretty much panicking right now. Based on experience, do you think I need to give up on this flight?   

P.S. I know there are other much cheaper flights available that involve a layover in China, but I've done that in the past and have no desire to do it again.

Can somebody tell me why this can happen? Was the flight sold out? In that case will it most likely be overbooked? Do they stop listing flights in order to promote other flights? How does that work... Just trying to understand. Thanks guys!"

So I finally get put through to a pleasant homosexual Hispanic man with United and explain my whole situation to him, he told me he couldn't just change the names on the tickets because that would void some of the flights, but that he could put some sort of note with mine and my friends ticket information saying that our last names don't actually have ""esq"" and ""PhD"" at the end of them. The guy from united also told me that Lufthansa won't have this info in their system, it'll just show up for them at the ticket counter in Chicago when I go to get my tickets, and he said I ""just have to trust [him] on this one.""

Also, how do I make sure to get our luggage tagged to get on the next flight to HNL?

The one time I flew United, they turned my flight around midflight and cancelled it. United's mileage program requires you to fly United flights to get to the next tier. I don't ever plan on flying on United after that fiasco (this might sound extremely petty), so the frequent flier points I get would only be from the rate of the lowest tier.

I plan on flying ANA for about 5 of those trips.  I could just book directly with ANA but I just got my Chase Sapphire card and it turns out I can transfer my Chase Sapphire reward points to United. Chase is not partnered with ANA unfortunately so I can't transfer it to ANA.

I also almost have gold with EVA Airlines but again Chase isn't partnered with EVA so I can't transfer directly to from Chase. I only have about 25k points in both EVA and United after using them for some purchases leftover, so it's not too much loss.

I asked if I can see the credit through UR or my United account, but the UR rep told me the only way to book the flight is to find a flight schedule I like and call them up.

"2019-08-16 21:31:57"|"American Airlines 3 hour delay"|"Hi all

I have described the context of the situation below, please could you let me know if you think I?m eligible for compensation or not?

This flight was booked through British Airways but operated by American Airlines. The issues started when our initial aircraft was discovered to have a hydraulic leak in Miami and consequently was put out of service whilst a replacement aircraft came in from London Heathrow. This delay was approximately 1 hour 30 minutes.

Once we were on the aircraft we were taxiing to the take off when the plane abruptly stopped and an announcement was made asking if there was a certain individual on the plane. Once it became clear this individual was not on the plane the plane returned to the gate. It became apparent that a passenger on the plane had accidentally picked up a piece of baggage that did not belong to them and the person who it did belong to was not onboard the flight, therefore for security reasons the piece of luggage had to be removed from the plane.

Once the security staff had interviewed the passenger and carried out a search of the aircraft we departed from Miami. We landed at London Heathrow approximately 2 hours 30 minutes later than expected. However as we began taxiing to the gate our path became blocked by departing aircraft. The key fact is here that by the time we got to the gate and the First door opened on the plane the time was just past 12:01, meaning that the plane was now over 3 hours later (3 hours 1 minute). Under EU regulation, the time of arrival is the point at which the aircraft door opens and the first passenger was able to disembark.

I received this reply from AA today:

As you have correctly identified, European Union Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 of the European Parliament and Council has established common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of cancellations or long delays of flights. Under this regulation, in the event of a flight cancellation or delay, passengers are entitled to established levels of compensation. However, this regulation does not apply when a flight is cancelled or delayed for less than 3-hours, flight is departing from the United States or a flight is cancelled or delayed due to weather or Air Traffic Control issues. Since flight 1529 was delayed because of non-qualifying reason situation, American Airlines is not required to provide the compensation you have referred to.



Based on the above, do I have any grounds or is it dead in the water? I can?t see how it isn?t a qualifying reason?

Additionally, could I have any recourse with BA?

"2019-03-10 06:54:18"|"United Airlines connection (too short)?"|"Hi folks,

I am not much of an air traveler; taking an international flight after a while.

My itinerary: UA 1972 (from DC to EWR) --> UA 48 (from EWR to Mumbai). The connection time is 1 hr 3 mins on paper. I originally booked it because I wanted the connection to be short, but due to a screwup (I thought the connection time was 1 hr 50 mins for some reason when booking the flight), it is \*too short\*.

I am traveling with 2 kids. Changing/canceling the ticket is going to be very expensive and is probably going to cost me the entire price of 4 tickets (me, spouse and 2 kids).

Scenario:

\+ After multiple back and forth calls with United, I am able to ascertain that we would not have to do another security checkin at EWR and our connecting flight departs from the exact same terminal we arrive at (terminal C).

\+ United does have a later flight at 10.20 PM that goes to Mumbai via Paris. This route also looks less crowded (as the more popular option is the direct flight that I have booked right now), so I am thinking we can get booked on that flight.

\- We are traveling with 2 kids, and while we are ok with missing the connecting flight and taking the next available one, the thought that terrifies me is having to spend the night at the terminal. Our connecting flight departs at 8.10 PM and the last flight according to my research leaves EWR at 11 PM. If we don't get booked on any flight that day, will United host us in a hotel room on the airport premises? I don't want my kids to sleep on the floor as much as I can avoid it. Any advice/anecdotes here would be hugely helpful, since I could not get a straight answer from anyone on the phone.

What would you guys do if you were in my situation? Am I overthinking this, and should take my chances, or is this my-house-is-on-fire situation and requires drastic measures even if it results in me losing upwards of $3k?

Thank you!

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\* UPDATE \*\*\*\*\*

Thank you everyone who replied to the thread. Sincerely appreciated!

\- [gt\_ap](https://www.reddit.com/user/gt_ap), all great points! To be clear, I was fine with the possibility of missing my connection \*with the expectation\* that my \*worst case scenario\* was being able to spend the night in a nearby hotel. What confused me was this - would I even be allowed to exit the terminal since I was already in transit? I posted this same question on tripadvisor, and I was assured by the experienced travelers that I certainly would be able to leave the terminal since I was still in the US. This did alleviate my concerns. I was prepared to shell out my own money to stay in a hotel of my own choice if it came down to that.

\- [tariqabjotu](https://www.reddit.com/user/tariqabjotu): I was wrong about the information on connecting flight (in my haste, I looked for alternative flights originating from IAD, whereas I should have done my search for flights originating from EWR). The alternate flight \*originating from EWR and reaching Mumbai\* is actually scheduled at 8.45 PM and connects via Munich. However as [FriendlyCrustaceans](https://www.reddit.com/user/FriendlyCrustaceans) said, taking a flight that connects me a second time through someplace else is only exacerbating the risk. In the vein, it would be better to simply take the direct flight from EWR to Mumbai and I might have to wait a full 24 hours to do that! Obviously, I was not prepared to lose a full day of my vacation.

\- I made this post after I already talked to United reps \*on the phone\* asking them to reschedule my IAD to EWR leg. However, the \*draconian option\* they gave me would cost me: $300 (penalty) + $50 (third party booking fee - Orbitz) + \~$650 (fare difference!!!). essentially, they were trying to rebook my entire itinerary essentially costing me the price of a new ticket altogether and also messing up my currently friendly return flight timings. This made the transaction an impossibility.

\- In my final attempt, I decided to reach United via their Facebook page. I messaged them, and within approximately \~2 hrs, I was engaged. The rep on the Facebook page was clearly more knowledgable and it took me only 2 roundtrip messages to explain them the situation which they understood perfectly. The response time after engagement was \~10 mins (not bad!). Immediately, the rep offered me to change my IAD to EWR leg at \*absolutely no cost\* due to something they called \*flight misalignment\*. I believe the rep was kind and used an internal technicality to make this change, and I took it! There is an alternate United flight from IAD to EWR leaving 12.30 PM. The issue now is I will wait \~6 hrs at EWR but at least, there will be peace of mind. I also have flex work arrangement, so I can even get some work done at the airport.

All is well that ends well. Thanks everyone again, and I hope this post helps someone who finds themselves in the same situation."

I booked a flight for feb from exploretrip.com for the first time. They charged me but the next day amount was refunded by them. I didn?t ask for it. The transaction is done by united airlines website name. I called the the airline ( it?s a connecting return flight from Montr?al to Washington to Houston operated by air Canada and united airlines) they confirmed that the booking is confirmed and I was issued e-tickets. 
As I read the reviews about exploretrip I got scared and cancelled my debit card so that they don?t do any unauthorized transactions but I am unsure what is the status of my booking? Is it valid? Should I buy a new ticket.
One more thing I paid 418$ for the ticket but the e ticket that air Canada issued me has an amount of 433$ written on it. Why would they (exploretrip) charge me less? And why did they return me the amount. What should I do. Anyone faced the issue? Please help"

We leave March 31st and return on April 7th.

Yesterday I called United to see about changing my departure location and was informed there is a $200 cancelation fee + the cost of the new flight from Phoenix to Philly. 

So I booked the new one way flight from Phoenix, and skipped the fee.

Currently the 2 flights that I had originally booked on my return trip are selling for $157 and $357. Would it not be beneficial for the airline to know that I won't be on the plane so that they can rebook these seats? 
Is there any way I can talk them into giving a credit/miles? 

I always look at that ""buy insurance"" and say ahhhh I don't need that. Lesson learned.

TIA for any input.

On United Airlines website they have details on sports equipment in the following link, https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/baggage/sports.aspx It states the following for Ski and Snowboard Equipment: . . United accepts one item of ski or snowboard equipment per customer as checked baggage. Equipment must be securely encased in a suitable container. An item of ski equipment consists of: Water skis Up to two snowboards in one bag Up to two pairs of snow skis and associated equipment in one bag and one ski boot bag. If the combined weight of the ski bag and boot bag is over 50 pounds (23 kg), applicable overweight charges apply. A boot bag without an accompanied ski bag is considered one bag and normal baggage fees apply. First or second checked bag service charges may apply. Ski equipment in addition to the baggage allowance will be assessed at the current excess baggage charge for a single piece, whether or not it is presented as a single piece. Ski and boot bags weighing more than 50 pounds (23 kg) that contain other items in addition to or in place of appropriate ski equipment will be subject to the applicable overweight checked baggage service charge. United is not liable for damage to water ski, snow ski, or snowboard equipment. Excess Valuation may not be purchased for water ski, snow ski, or snowboard equipment. . . . I've tried calling United and get a different answer each time in regards to being charged an oversize baggage fee. Since majority of adult snowboard bags are larger than 62 inches (158 cm). The description states if the bag is more than 50 lbs than it will receive a overweight baggage fee, however it states nothing about oversize baggage fee. I'm not sure if sport equipment overrules that because it does not state it. . I'm wondering if others just pay the standard $25 checked bag fee or if they are charged $200 for oversize baggage. .

In light of the [doctor being violently dragged off of a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/64jmub/doctor_violently_dragged_from_overbooked_united/) and the resulting social media backlash, I decided to do some digging into what airlines do when it comes to overbooking. All of the below information came from each individual airline's Contract of Carriage, which can be found on their websites (I've provided links to the ones I researched). Naturally I'm not going to have everyone's preferred airline, so don't hate on me too bad if I didn't include your go-to. 

Per regulations, every airline asks for volunteers to give up their spot for compensation. After that, airlines can set their own rules to decide who gets left behind. Now then, in no particular order...

**United Airlines** looks at several variables: Fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and time of check-in without advanced seat assignment. Basically if you're not a loyal customer and/or early bird, you might not want to get too comfortable in your seat. [Read United's full policy here - Rule 25](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec25)

**Southwest Airlines** is pretty simple. The person in the last boarding position will be denied boarding, regardless of fare. [Read Southwest's full policy here - Page 39](https://www.southwest.com/assets/pdfs/corporate-commitments/contract-of-carriage.pdf)

**American Airlines** bases the decision primarily on check-in time, but also takes severe hardships, fare paid, and frequent flyer status into consideration sometimes as well. [Read American's full policy here](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#oversales)

**Delta Airlines** has a pretty complex policy. Essentially, if you paid a premium fare, you have nothing to worry about. That said, passengers with boarding passes are safer than those who don't have them or didn't check in. In those cases, rebooked passengers or frequent flyers are safer than a passenger who didn't check in and doesn't have a boarding pass. Exception: Special needs passengers (disabilities, unaccompanied minors, etc.) are likely good to go no matter what. [Read Delta's full policy here - Rule 245 on Page 42](http://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract_of_carriage_dom.pdf)

**Frontier Airlines** has a policy about as simple as Southwest. Passengers who check in after all seats have been assigned won't get a seat. [Read Frontier's full policy here](https://www.flyfrontier.com/legal/contract-of-carriage/)

**Alaska Airlines** favors the early bird. Anyone with a confirmed seat assignment won't get booted. Don't have one? Show up early and you're more likely to get a seat. [Read Alaska's full policy here](https://www.alaskaair.com/~/media/Files/PDF/contract-of-carriage/Alaska-Airlines-Contract-of-Carriage.pdf?INT=AS_Legal_||20160816_CoC_ENG||)

**So you've been involuntarily bumped. Now what?** If they can still get you to your destination within an hour on a different flight, airlines aren't required to pay you anything. If you get there between 60-119 minutes after your scheduled arrival, you're owed 200% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $675). If you arrive 120 minutes or longer, you're owed 400% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $1350). There's other small print to go through, but that's the gist.

Hopefully this is a little bit helpful. It was somewhat eye-opening to realize that this wasn't just a United Airlines thing."

While I sincerely hope this post is far from shit, here goes ? The Ultimate List of Money Saving Tips for Travel

**Flights**

- First and foremost?[Read the /r/travel Airfare Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/airfare) ? You?ll soon be transformed into a cheap flight guru and save /u/jippiejee an ulcer in the process.

- Sign up for airline newsletters: I know your inbox is already overflowing with crap from JCPenny?s & Old Navy but some of the cheapest tickets I?ve ever purchased were direct from the airlines during a flash sale. This technique is especially good for domestic flights or shorter international routes.

- Get to know the budget airlines serving your hub or hubs you plan to visit. Most of these airlines don?t show up on flight search engines?.WOW, Wizz, etc. Just Google <budget airlines *airport name*>.

- [Sign up for Scott?s Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/) ? Also, http://www.secretflying.com/ & http://www.theflightdeal.com/

- Roll the Dice with 3rd Party Booking Sites: OTAs will bend you over without lube should a situation arise where you need to access Customer Service ? but if you?re 100% sure of your dates/times and are capable of spelling your name correctly, there are plenty of scenarios where CheapoAir, Expedia or Travelocity do find goofy flight options that are significantly cheaper than booking direct. Travelers willing to endure brutal layovers to save a few hundred bucks can score killer deals. Don?t rely on OTAs but don?t totally discount them during your flight search, either.

- [Massage Google Flights? prostate:](https://www.google.com/flights/) [Here?s a good article from the Liberal Elite](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/entry/google-flights-tips-tricks_us_58062e82e4b0b994d4c1675a) on giving Google Flights the finger in a good way ? Google Flights is a utensil you can?t afford to leave off your tool belt.

- Ask your parents for loads of free money: YMMV with this one. I?ve never had any luck with it but I?ve seen plenty of folks doing Yoga poses on rocks who have.

- [Listen to the fine people at Skyscanner.](https://www.skyscanner.net/news/20-money-saving-travel-tips-and-secrets) They certainly know what they?re on about.

- I don?t personally do it but /r/churning/ provides plenty with a MASSIVE travel boner.

- Try to be as flexible as you can?search for flights using the flight calendar whenever possible. The exact same flight from the same airline can often be 1/2 the price with just a 2-3 day shift.

**Accommodation**

- To get a nicer hotel room at a deep discount, [give Hotwire Hot Rates a go.]( http://hotwire.com/) A similar system is available at https://www.priceline.com/

- Search rooms on Booking.com but then contact hotels direct to see if they?ll meet/match that price. Properties lose fat commissions to booking sites and can be open to negotiating, particularly if it?s a small owner-run place.

- https://www.booking.com/ is also a pretty good resource straight-up for cheap hotel rates. 

- Believe it or not, a lot of people still have no clue about hostels?an important detail to note is that not all hostels are 20 to a room, loud, stinky dens of iniquity?some are (and that?s great if a good party and cheap bunk is what you?re after) but others aren?t. You can find super nice hostels that are more like boutique hotels with shared rooms than wild booze/sex dungeons for 20-somethings?and everything in between. Here are a few popular engines: http://www.hostelbookers.com/ http://www.hostelworld.com/ https://www.hostelz.com/ http://hostelzoo.com/

- Sign up for these Newsletters: https://www.travelzoo.com/top20/ & http://www.dealbase.com/#

- You?re probably a millennial. Act like it: https://www.airbnb.com/

- Caveat?I know nothing about this particular form of freeloading: https://www.couchsurfing.com/

- [Vacation rentals can be a killer deal if you?re traveling with a 
group:](http://vrbo.com/) Along the same lines, Google <vacation rentals in *town name*> to find local websites with apartment/house listings. 

- Ever considered camping? In particular there are a lot of nice campsites in Europe just outside major tourist centers. Even in Latin America it's often cheaper to camp than to stay in a hostel.

- Sometimes not booking ahead pays off. Often the cheapest lodging (especially in southeast Asia) can be found on the ground once you arrive.

- Similarly, you can save another $5-10 dollars a night if you forgo air conditioning. You'd be surprised how little you miss it when you have a powerful fan right above you.

**Transport**

- [Rome 2 Rio]( http://www.rome2rio.com/) is fucking amazing.

- Take the subway and don?t be intimidated by the public bus system. Buses are for losers who can?t afford to buy a car?if they can figure it out?you can figure it out. Or walk, you lazy bastard.

- For low-budget travelers, the old ?take a night bus/train to save a night?s lodging? still works wonders?bonus points if you?re a normal sized human and can actually sleep in a chair.

- Rent a bike.

- Carpooling: https://www.blablacar.com/

- Hitchhiking: http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page

**Food**

- Follow the 6-block rule: Never eat within 6 blocks of a major tourist site. 

- You?ve been buying food from the supermarket your whole life. It won?t kill you to eat a peanut butter & jelly sandwich in Berlin.

- Eat local: Take a chance and wander into neighborhood joints where you have no idea what?s going on. Make the ?I?m hungry? hand-to-mouth gesture to the wait staff and they?ll figure out that you?d like to exchange money for food.

- Along the same lines?ask locals, even the staff at your hostel/hotel, where you can find good cheap eats. 

- Pack Imodium and eat street food.

- Go Full Clich?! Ooh?la?la, baguette and brie on the green. Voila! D?jeuner bon march?!

**Activities**

- Research museum pricing policies and free nights: Many major museums/sites offer free entrance once a month or once a week. If you?re willing to wait in line you can schedule your visits accordingly. Feel free to use this wait time to whinge to fellow queue mates about your crippling student loans. 

- Most cities will have a ?What?s Happening? site online or a free newspaper version around town?find free festivals, free exhibits and free whatevers. 

- Into art? Skip museums and browse galleries?just shave and take a shower first?don?t make it obvious that you can?t afford a goddamn thing in there.

- Learn to explore aimlessly?some of the most interesting cultural differences can be found wandering the aisles of a hardware store.

- Don?t be afraid to skip big name sites if they don?t interest you.

**Other**

- Follow your favorite airlines, hotels & travel sites on social media for first crack at specials.

- [Research destinations with this Travel Calculator]( http://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2016/10/14/free-travel-budget-calculator-will-help-find-perfect-destination/): It could be that there?s another trip just as interesting as the one you?ve got planned for half the cost.

- Don?t stress balls over it?but if possible, find a bank card with zero to no international withdrawal fees. The Yankee Doodles use Charles Schwab. (I use the same bank I always have and just pay 5 bucks because I am old and lazy.) If you do simply pay the fee (like me), take out the max with every withdrawal to limit the damage.

- And here?s a pseudo-legal way to find odd jobs to offset travel costs: https://www.workaway.info/

- Slow Travel: You?ll never see it all. Don?t try to. Spend more time 
in fewer places and you?ll save a bundle?my recommendation is to blow all those savings at the pub.

- Search Google for promotional codes?you know that little box at checkout? Promo/Coupon? You?d be amazed how often you can find a code to slap in there for an additional discount.

- Don?t buy a backpack full of garbage?it?s one thing to bring home a super cool keepsake or two but 90% of the shit I used to buy in the name of *souvenir!* is now collecting dust on a family member?s curio shelf.

- Skype is a dirt cheap way to stay in touch and is easier than typing out messages on your phone or finding a computer. You can call any phone in the world so cheaply it's practically free.

- A big part of saving money is to avoid losing money to scammers -- check out travelscams.org

- Got an early flight and don't want to pay for a taxi when public transport isn't running? Arrive the night before and sleep in the airport...some airports are better than others but here's a site that tells you which are the best/worst for camping out: http://www.sleepinginairports.net

**Stuff Not to Do**

- Don?t buy one of those stupid Lifestraws as if you?re living in a post-apocalyptic video game ? just by bottled water like the rest of us?most places sell 5 liter jugs so the true penny pinchers can top up in the hostel.

- I personally refuse to support Hidden Ticket Travel but [here are the bozos behind the madness.]( https://skiplagged.com/)

- Above I said, ?Don?t be afraid to skip big name sites if they don?t interest you.? Don?t confuse this with ?Skip sites that DO interest you over a few bucks.? Don?t be that guy who went to Rome and was edgy enough to only see the Coliseum from the outside.

- Don?t be a fucking mooch. Don?t be ?that guy? who fills his backpack with the free hostel breakfast, ensuring hostel goers with a hangover are left to starve because all the toast is in some hippie?s Jansport. Similarly, don?t whine and cry and bitch and moan and wail on to your new travel buds about how ?poor? you are so they?ll buy you drinks or what have you?You?re not poor. Poor people don?t go on vacation. I repeat. Poor people don?t vagabond across the globe in search of Machu Picchus, foreign poontang and spiritual enlightenment. Poor people don?t own 200 Euro backpacks with Camelbak pouches.

**Addendum**

If you?ve got tips you?d like added to the list, just send me a PM and I?ll cut & paste them in:

- Time can be just as valuable as money. With short trips, if there's only a small difference, a 4 hour flight is more cost effective than than a 12 hour bus or train ride. (Hell, I once came across two flights, one was 36 hours long, cost $600, the other was 16 hours long and cost $650. Is $50 worth 20 less hours, probably.) Europe is lucky to have all of those budget airlines, but while they can be sweet, they will nickel and dime you for everything. They'd charge you for air if they could.

- Booking hostels directly is nearly always 10-15% cheaper than the booking sites out there, and they will price match. Also makes problems infinitely easier to fix. The one downside is you're open to foreign transaction fees, which leads into my next point, which you briefly touched on.

- If you're from the United States I highly suggest looking into a Charles Schwab checking account. Makes life easier, and safer so you don't have to pull out the max and walk around with a lot of cash. They will refund you all ATM fees and there are no transaction fees for foreign purchases. When you open one they give you a brokerage account, which you don't have to use, and there are no yearly fees on either account.

"2015-01-09 03:16:15"|"How One United Airlines Maintenance Guy in San Francisco Ruined Everybody's Trip to Sydney"|"Greetings, /r/travel - 

I'm still processing what ended up being one of the worst nights of my life on what should have been the trip of a lifetime.  A single United Airlines maintenance guy managed to ruin **everybody's** night, cost me $1100 and I never even saw what the guy looked like.  Hopefully, one or two things will happen as a result of this post - Someone might help me understand how to make this right with United ... I seem to be at a loss since our flight was 'cancelled' not 'bumped.'  Second thing, hopefully this helps you understand what happens when you fly United and what you can expect if the unexpected happens.  Here goes ...

***Here's What Happened***

We boarded our flight at SFO (UA863, if you want to know) and prepared for a 15-hr nonstop flight to Sydney.  It left at 10:30PM and when we boarded and went to the back row, we discovered that our seats were still in pieces at the back of the plane due to some 'maintenance issue.'  We got them back together, settled in and waited for takeoff.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.

They kept updating us every 15 minutes that a 'maintenance issue' was delaying us but they expected to leave shortly.  I took a nap and kept my 8-year-old occupied.  They took pity on us, passed out water and let us use the lavs.  I kept telling myself that the matter would soon be resolved and we'd be on our way.

I was wrong.

After three hours - it was 1:30 at this point.   They cancelled our flight.  The 270 people on the flight, all sleepy and pissed off, filed off the plane and we started making other arrangements.  Given that the flight was on 12/19, I knew it was going to be tough to find alternate arrangements since everyone seems to go down to Sydney at that time of year.  Called the 800 number, made arrangements to get booked on another flight, only to learn that the next available flight leaves Los Angeles two days later.  That created boondoggle #1, in which we discover that Expedia's non-refundable rooms really mean non-refundable.  Now we're out over $500 for the two days we won't be there.

So we stand in line anyway for another 2 hours to see if we can get a better option - it's 3:30 by the time I finally talk to a gate agent and find out, no, no other planes are leaving ... including the one that we just left.

And we didn't leave for a really stupid reason: 

Turns out - the only thing keeping us leaving that night was the latch on the crew sleeping quarters door of the 777.  I guess it wouldn't lock right and the maintenance guy spent 3 hours farting around with it instead of replacing the door, as he announced he finally would, just in time for the captain to say ""we're not allowed to fly after that amount of time so sorry, this flight is cancelled.""

I don't know about you but I've work in maintenance operations for a living and I know that you're allowed to escalate issues to replace non-working hardware when you can't find the simple answer in a short amount of time.  Had the maintenance guy been competent, he would have spent 30 minutes troubleshooting the door, replaced it in another 60 and this thread would never have happened.

***And Then ...***

We go downstairs to get our bags back.  Turns out, someone at United decides that everyone getting a bag back needs to file a 'lost bag claim,' creating another 2 or 3 hour-long line for us to stand in.  After about half an hour, we decide ""we'll check our bags when we return for our rescheduled flight"" and go home.  I'm glad we did - some people stayed there until 10 the following morning waiting for the one guy working baggage at 3am to get their bags.  Some of them never did.

It's now 4am.  Never having used Uber before, I approach a cab driver for a lift home.  He tels me that it'll cost me $150 to get home and United has already told me that I'll be compensated for my cab trip.  Fine, whatever, let's just go home.  We pile in and he drives us 45 minutes to get back home.  It's pissing down rain and it takes him (no joke) 30 minutes to figure out how to do a manual credit card receipt transaction since his reader isn't working and he won't take a check.  I have this guy yelling in Persian at someone on the phone in my drive way at 5am on a Saturday for half an hour - surprised my neighbors didn't call the cops.

***And Then ...***

We show up early to SFO 2 days later - I carefully check with United and Delta to make sure our bags were found and ready to go down to Sydney since my wife has time-sensitive medication and she only packed so much in her carry-on.  After several trips back and forth, they assure us that yes, the bags are checked ... we should be good to go.  We jump on the Delta flight, change at LAX and then down to Sydney.

When we arrive - sure enough - there's problems.  The bag with the medicine arrived (thank God) but one of our bags, the one with all of our fancy-dress event clothing is not there.  We file a 'lost bag' claim in Sydney, go out and wait for our clothes.

Next day?  No bag

Getting desperate, we go to the CBD and buy some last-minute clothing for our event.  Between the clothes, shoes and toiletries we were missing, another $400 down the drain.  Our bag eventually shows, but too late to do anything other than say ""yeah, that's nice.""  We put the whole thing out of our mind, even though I do file a claim with United for all of the money we lost as a result of the unlatched crew sleeping quarters door.

And Now
I just got an email today from United.  They offered a '$125 voucher' as a gesture of goodwill.  I declined and requested compensation similar to what they'd offer someone who has been involuntarily bumped from a flight.  They declined, saying ""  Please understand that our industry is vulnerable to a number of challenges that can, and do, affect our operation on a daily basis. For us to absorb our passengers? incurred expenses or offer cash for compensation would not be a long-term business proposition we would ever be able to maintain.""

This is from the company that paid their CEO $8 Million last year and the last CEO $17 Million when he exited as part of the United / Continental merger.  I don't think asking for $1100 to compensate us is unreasonable, they pay as much as $1300 per bumped passenger.

**What We Lost**
I did the math:

* $130 for the cab ride home at 4am
* $526.78 in lost hotel room fees
* $45 for the Uber Ride Back (Never using SF Cabs again)
* $435.73 to replace the clothes we had to buy because our bag was lost in Los Angeles

All told - we spent $1137.51 because a United Maintenance Guy couldn't figure out how to get a crew sleeping quarters door latch to close in less than 3 hours.  United's offer of a $125 voucher' as a 'goodwill' gesture doesn't even cover the cab ride home, to say nothing of everything else we lost.

I'm happy to say that Reddit helped us enjoy our stay otherwise - the folks over at /r/sydney were top-notch as far as their recommendations go and we managed to have a great time down under ...

That is, as long as we didn't talk about United.

Suggestions?

***TL;DR - Flew on United, they cancelled our flight for a dumb reason and now we're out $1137.51***

EDIT - To clarify, I realize that many people feel that this is 'just one of those things' that United should not be held accountable for.  Let me add some information that I feel should be helpful:

* United had this 777 at the gate for several hours before boarding, I know because we were there to look at it.  Any maintenance issues with the plane had many, many hours to be handled before takeoff.  Whatever happened in terms of maintenance at 10:30 in the evening didn't have to wait for that point in time to be handled (i.e. - if my seat could be torn apart and put back together at 10:30, there's no reason it couldn't have been put back together at 3:30).  United didn't put a priority on having this plane passenger-ready for an on-time departure.

* The issue that caused our flight to be cancelled was something that could have been handled in a shorter amount of time had United focused on getting us in the air on time as planned.  Instead, the maintenance guy troubleshot the door for 3 hours before announcing that the door needed to be replaced, an activity taking, according to them '60 minutes', putting them over the amount of time they were allowed to fly.  Had United put a priority on getting passengers into the air, the maintenance crew should have been free to say ""You know, this is taking too long - let's replace the door and get these people out of here.""  I don't know the circumstances behind their decision to troubleshoot instead of replace, but when you're doing maintenance for a living and people's dollars are being lost for every minute you're troubleshooting, you're allowed to say ""do what you have to do, get these people back online.""

Are all of these things minor issues?  Yeah, sure ... but when minor issues are allowed to get in the way of the trip you've been planning for seven years, when those issues create a cascade effect of other problems that you were not budgeting for then yes, you're understandably disappointed.  You also expect the company whose decisions created the circumstance to make it right.  

Thanks for reading.

Edit2: updated the numbers to reflect the correct capacity of a 777"

"2016-12-20 05:43:36"|"Advice on unintentional skiplag/hidden-city itinerary"|"Hi /r/travel. So I recently booked a Scott's Cheap flights deal to Copenhagen from Seattle with my girlfriend and a friend.  Originally the plan was to go into Copenhagen, and find some cheap Ryanair flights or trains to go to Germany and Stockholm.  As we were planning, we realized the connection for our inbound flight was in Frankfurt.  My girlfriend suggested we just get off and start our trip there.  We booked our entire itinerary including hotels in Germany, a one-way out of Berlin and trains between CPH/Stockholm.  

Just today, I have learned about the concept of skiplagging/hidden-city ticketing (not sure which term is most relevant).  I guess we accidentally booked a trip using this concept without realizing it was an issue and that airlines may cancel the return leg of our journey.  The thing is, we didn't do this to purposefully dodge costs to Frankfurt.  For all I know, the price to Frankfurt might have been similar.  We literally just had an idea on how to more conveniently book our trek and went with it.  

So my question is, what can I do now? I have a ton of non-refundable accommodations already booked.  Do I have any options?  Can we check-in for our flight and turn around or will the ticketing agent stop us?  Can we call the airline and explain our misunderstanding?  Does it help that the flights are on different airlines?  Our inbound is Lufthansa and outbound is SAS/United.  Not sure what options I have that don't involve purchasing another ticket.

Thanks"

I am willing to spend *more* than the voucher price, as well. I appreciate any help or thoughts you may have.

Rules/Considerations/Research:

* I am looking to travel December 16 - 31 of 2017. I believe I need to land before midnight of the new year, PST. I want the trip to register to my United account before the end of the year to help me achieve Platinum status if possible. As a result, I'm especially interested in routes that maximize my PQD/PQM and to a lesser extent, PQS.

* I can only book flights through United.com. Depending on route, I can book other Star Alliance carriers via the United website.

* I will depart from the San Francisco Bay Area, any of the three airports is fine: SJC, SFO, OAK.

* I would like to go somewhere tropical/warm if possible but it really doesn't have to be. Just...not cold.

* BONUS: If I can stay in a Marriott property, all the better. Starwood property is great, too. Others, sure. Not a requirement though.

* Right now I am considering Mauritius, Seychelles, Maldives, Dar es Salaam, Malta, Sicily, Johannesburg, Burma, Auckland, and Sydney. I have tried and failed to find a Europe itinerary that drains the voucher and allows me to book on United. This is by no means an exhaustive list.

* I like going places where I can do things--I don't just want to park myself on the beach though I do enjoy some rest days. One thing I like about Mauritius is I feel better about patronizing a place that doesn't have (relatively) reprehensible societal and governmental norms.

* I'm interested in India but don't know where to start and am a little nervous about India for some reason. If you have great recs, I'd love that.

* There are a lot of closer, nearby, or more accessible places but I like the idea of using this free money to go somewhere I usually wouldn't spend my own money on. The kind of place I'm not likely to be able to go in the future easily. A flight to London or Singapore is easy and cheap(ish). I want to push myself a bit.

* I'm a vegetarian--need to be able to go somewhere where I can procure meals that are meatless.

Thanks!"
"2017-03-16 21:36:06"|"Booked 2 tickets on United for the same name by accident. United no help so far - any advice?"|"Writing this for my dad as he doesn't have any social media accounts:

I am booked on United flight Shanghai to LAX in business class. This is a full fare business class ticket paid for my employer. My wife is accompanying me on the trip so on January 2, 2017, I bought a business class ticket for her directly from United on its website for the same flight. My wife?s ticket cost me $1940. A few days ago, I was preparing for my trip and I checked my wife?s reservation. To my surprise (horror?) I discovered that I had listed my name as the traveler instead of my wife. (By the way, this is a very easy mistake to make since when you are signed on to United?s website and you book a ticket, when you enter the traveler?s name a pull-down menu appears and my name is listed above my wife?s name.)  I didn?t think it was a big deal to change it since obviously I would not have paid for two business class seats on the same flight. Boy was I in for a surprise. 
I called United this past Sunday and explained the obvious mistake and asked that the second reservation be changed to correctly list my wife?s name.  I was told in no uncertain terms by the reservation agent that it was too bad. I would have to buy a new ticket ? which now cost $3,000 -- and could pay a cancellation fee and use the value of my current ticket on a future flight.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and spoke to someone in the United Chicago office. She was of absolutely no help and just repeated what the first United rep had said. She also said that I had received an email when I booked my wife?s ticket and it was my responsibility to make sure that everything was correct in the booking. I explained that I have made at least 15 flight bookings with United in the last six months, and that I also get promotional emails from United at least once a week so it would not be surprising that I would miss this email. I also told her that I was a very good customer of United and that I HAVE 1,370,000 LIFETIME FLIGHT MILES ON UNITED AIRLINES ? which should at least count for something in correcting an obvious mistake.  Nope ? makes no difference whatsoever. I asked to speak to her supervisor and was told that it was not possible. So now I am stuck with a ticket that I very likely will not be able to use, and I have to buy a new ticket for my wife.


Has customer service at United fallen so low that the airline has to profit from the mistake of one of its loyal customers?  I told her that I have four business class flights currently booked and paid for with United, and after those flights I would try hard never to fly United again. 

TLDR: Accidentally booked 2 business class tickets on united under my name.  United is refusing to change one of the tickets to my wife's name and the net result will cost me at least 1k to resolve.

"2015-11-09 07:44:49"|"Visa tips and requirements"|"The rules for visas can be confusing, so I thought I'd put together some info on applying for them.  Some of this info will be a little US-centric, but the general process will be the same regardless of which passport you have.  

A visa is basically permission to enter a country.  You **always** need a visa when visiting another country, but some countries have set up a (reciprocal) 'visa-waiver' where you don't need to apply for one if you meet the visa waiver requirements.  These requirements will depend on which passport you have.  For example, US citizens (and Australia/Canada/etc) can visit certain European (Schengen) countries for combined 90 days out of 180 days without a visa.  However, if you want to stay more than 90 days in the Schengen zone, you **will** need a visa.  Thailand is another example, where US citizens don't need a visa if staying less than 30 days (arriving by air) or 15 days if arriving via land.  Most Western Europe/Canada/USA/Australia passports are lucky as many European/North American countries do not require visas for short visits.  Failing to check visa requirements beforehand can be a very expensive problem! Airlines will refuse to let you board unless you have the correct documentation.  One other important thing to check is how much time is left before your passport expires, many countries require your passport to be valid for 6 months (even if your stay is shorter).

A good place to start checking visa requirement is the Wikipedia page.  Search for 'Visa requirements for X citizens' where X is your passport.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Australian_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_British_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Canadian_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens

etc.

Or check the 'visa policy of X' for the country you are planning to visit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Thailand

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Vietnam

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_India

etc.

Really the best way to check if you need a visa is using the TIMATIC database, this is what the airlines will use.

http://www.skyteam.com/en/Why-SkyTeam/Services/Visa-and-Health/
 
**Visas at an embassy/consulate:**  If you require a visa, usually you must apply for a visa at a country's consulate or embassy.   The actual visa is a stamp or whole-page sticker in your passport.  Visa requirements unfortunately can vary per embassy, but the basic things you will need are a filled out application, visa fee, and your passport.  There are usually three ways to go about applying.  First, you can go to the embassy/consulate yourself.  This is obviously inconvenient if you don't live in a city with a consulate.  This also involves some amount of waiting time, so you will need at least a free day.  Another way of applying is using a visa service.  You send them your application, passport and visa fee.  The visa service also will charge their own service fee on top of that.  The final way to apply is to send the application directly to the embassy/consulate via USPS/FedEx, with a pre-paid return envelope.  However, some embassies (eg. China in the US) no longer accept mailed-in applications and you must use a service or apply in person.  Best to check the application requirements on their website.

However you apply, the visa can take several days or weeks to issue, so be sure to give yourself plenty of time.  If using a visa service, add an extra couple of days.  Some places offer same-day or next-day processing for an extra fee.  I always use some sort of tracking (FedEx, US Priority Express) so that I can keep track of where my passport is and when it is on it's way back.  I actually applied for a visa last week and I saw my return tracking go live yesterday, I'll have my passport back tomorrow.

Payment for visas is usually via cashier's check/money order, at least in the US.  In some other countries, if applying in person you must go to the embassy, get a form then go to a bank and pay, get a receipt, then return to the embassy with that receipt.  Pretty inefficient unfortunately.  This is what I had to do when applying for my Iranian visa in Istanbul.

Checklist for applying for visa (* are sometimes requirements):

* Passport
* Filled out application (usually x2)
* Passport photos (usually x2)
* Visa fee
* Copy of flight itinerary
* Prepaid return envelope (if applying via mail/visa service)
* Copy of Hotel reservations(*)
* Cover letter(*)
* Copy of Bank statement(*)
* Copy of Yellow-fever vaccination(*): required for some African countries
* Letter of introduction from travel agent(*) : required for Russia, some African and Central-Asian countries

The visa application can usually be downloaded from the embassy website.  VisaHQ is another good (US) resource for finding applications and requirements (generally http://<countryname>.visahq.com)

For the copy of the flight itinerary, I will use something like TripIt and generate an itinerary without actually buying the tickets.  Not completely kosher, but I like to pad my planned visit dates by a day or two on either end just in case plans change (I still put in the same flight numbers I plan to use) or the visa gets denied for some reason (luckily Iran's so far the only one I've had denied).  I ended up needing this padding when visiting the Congos a few years ago... my flight to Kinshasa (DR Congo) was diverted to Brazzaville (Rep Congo).  If my Rep Congo visa wasn't valid yet I wouldn't have been able to get off the plane.

The cover letter is usually optional but I'll usually write one. Basically it just lays out what kind of visa I would like, and my planned itinerary and perhaps something nice to say about the country I am visiting.  

**Visas on arrival:** Some countries can issue a visa when you arrive at the airport or at a border.  These on-arrival visas may have different stay requirements or fees than one obtained in an embassy.  Some visa on arrival require pre-authorization before travel.  This can be arranged usually though a travel agent, hotel, or website.  The pre-authorization can take a few days.  You will receive a confirmation email that you show at airport checkin and on arrival to receive your visa.  There will usually be a window labeled 'VISA' before immigration where you will get your visa sticker.  

**e-visas: ** These are the latest type of visas, which require applying and paying online ahead of your visit.  Similarly to pre-arranged VOA, you will get a printout/verification that you show at immigration on arrival.  This verification can take a few hours or days to receive.  E-visas may also have different requirements/limitations than a visa issued at an embassy.

**Passport photos:** Most paper visa applications require one or two passport photos.  It's actually quite easy and cheap to make your own.  You will need a tripod or someone to take a photo of you against a white background.  An easy way to do this is to drape a sheet over a door.  Don't worry about getting the photo perfectly centered.  Just make sure to have a neutral face, nothing covering your face, etc.  Then use an online photo-sizing tool to center the face.  2""x2"" are usually fine when applying for visas.  You can then use GIMP/Photoshop/etc to create a tiled 4""x6"" image (6 photos).  Some online sites can do this as well.  You can then upload & print this at Walgreens/CVS/Walmart/etc for $0.30 or so.  I'll usually get 3-4 printed at a time as I apply for a lot of visas! If you use European/UK visa photo (35mm x 45mm) tiling you can get 8 per page.

Here are some countries that require some sort of visa:

* USA: Requires pre-approval (ETSA) if from a visa-waiver country.  (https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/)
* Australia: requires pre-authorized ETA (US) or eVisitor Visa (UK)  (https://www.border.gov.au/Trav)
* India: e-visa (https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/info1.jsp)
* Turkey: e-visa (http://www.evisa.gov.tr)
* Iran: Complicated.  Some countries get visa-on-arrival (Aussies).  Brits/Canadians/US need a visa beforehand. 
* Egypt: Visa on arrival, easy
* Bahrain: e-visa (https://www.evisa.gov.bh/) or visa on arrival.
* Jordan: Visa on arrival (at airport), easy. Visa required beforehand if crossing overland at Allenby bridge.
* Brazil: US citizens need a visa, Europeans don't
* Argentina: US citizens must pay reciprocity fee before travel ($160) - https://reciprocidad.provincianet.com.ar/ but good for life of passport
* China: Visa required beforehand.  Some countries can get 72-hr visa-free transit (eg. flying USA -> Beijing -> Thailand you could stay 72 hrs in Beijing).
* Vietnam: Visa-free (Brits, some Europeans) for 15-day stays.  For longer stays, or US citizens, pre-authorized visa on arrival available at airports only.  Otherwise visa required beforehand if arriving via land.
  Pre-authorized visas can be arranged through http://www.myvietnamvisa.com , http://www.vietnamvisa.org, etc.  There are lots out there, just pick the cheapest.  Takes 2-3 days to get the visa authorization.

* Thailand: Visa-free for 30-days if arriving by air. 15 if arriving via land.
* Laos: Visa on arrival
* Russia: Visa required beforehand.  It may be possible to visit St. Petersburg and some other cities for 72-hrs without a visa if you are on a cruise/tour.
* Sri Lanka: e-visa (http://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/center.jsp?locale=en_US)

I don't travel on these American airlines ordinarily. Is there something I should know? Are all three airlines roughly the same?

I'm sort of spooked by the horror stories (i.e. low quality ratings, having to pay for bags, fighting for overhead luggage space, oversized passengers in the seat beside you, overzealous American border officials searching your phone, people being dragged off flights and so on)."

For the past two years, I've been flying 100,000 miles per year (mainly for business travel) and have done it all on United or a Star Alliance partner. Turned out to be well worth it: from the free baggage check to the priority call center to the free upgrades... it just adds to the thrill of world travel.

"2017-11-14 19:02:27"|"Norwegian vs United"|"Hi everyone,

We'll be traveling to Europe next summer. I found round trip flights for just over $1,000 each on Norwegian. I also found flights on United for about $100 more than the Norwegian flights for my boyfriend and I, but over $500 more for my dad (he will be coming back at a different date and from a different city than my boyfriend and I).

I was just wondering how much different Norwegian is, since it is a budget airline.

I looked up seat configurations and the seat pitch is the same, and Norwegian's seat width is 1.3 inches or less than United. Is this a big difference? It doesn't sound like it to me, but who knows.

Is there any reason I should pick United over Norwegian? I don't care about not getting a meal."
"2012-08-06 03:56:14"|"How to get escorted off a plane with United without doing anything wrong at all - it's a long story."|"All you need to know about me is this: I live in Upstate New York, I had a summer internship in Michigan, and I have family in Southern California.

Back in April I bought a round trip flight with United Airlines for my internship. The return flight to Syracuse (Grand Rapids-Cleveland-Syracuse) was scheduled for August 4. Then partway through the summer I decided to go to California with my family and bought a ticket for the same day, but
 it was cheaper to buy a new roundtrip flight through American Airlines than it was to change the United flight so I bought the California one (Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County) for later in the afternoon on August 4. I figured I'd meet up with my mom, say hi and give her some stuff I didn't need and then fly on to California.

So in the morning on Saturday August 4 I set out for Grand Rapids, checked in with United - they gave me both my ticket for Cleveland and for Syracuse, all ready to go - and in texting my parents I got this weird text from my mom - u r flying rite 2 cali. I had NO idea what she was talking about so I called her and she said, ?Your Cleveland-Syracuse flight got canceled, United called the house yesterday and said they were going to call you.? I have no idea how they got my home phone number, and that hasn't been useful to me in over a year because I?ve been studying abroad and not home at all, but they never called me, never emailed me, nothing. So then my dad is calling them again while I'm trying to find someone in the godforsaken Grand Rapids airport - there is ONE person working there for United and he says he can't help me right now because he is boarding the Cleveland flight and I said no, you need to help me right now because I either need to get on this flight or not. And he won't help me so I leave and go back to the check-in desk outside of the secure area to get them to fix it.

I explain to the guy at the ticket desk what's going on, and he brings out a lady who must be higher up than him because obviously it's all too complex for him to understand. She says our contract with you is to get you to Syracuse not California. I say yes, but your contract was also to get me there at a specific time and you cancelled the flight that would get me there on time so I could make my next flight and get to Orange County. She says well we'll have American Airlines fix this for you and prints me an itinerary for American that says now Grand Rapids-Chicago-Syracuse and then I can get on my American Airlines flight - Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County. I say fine - they basically passed me off so that I can't yell at them and get anything else out of them - and go to the American desk. The man there is really nice and fixes it so I just go Grand Rapids-Chicago-Orange County. So I fly to Chicago and it's all sorted out.

My brother, sister, cousin and grandmother are also in Chicago, flying with United of all things, leaving a good 6 hours earlier than me, and I know that United owes me compensation for the canceled flight so I figure I'll try and get on that flight, I might as well try and save my grandmother a trip to the airport late at night. So I go to the customer service desk for United and there's a huge line and so I call customer service while I'm in the line. The woman I spoke with gets me exactly what I want, says my itinerary is now changed for Orange County and I just need to print my boarding pass for this flight at 3pm local time. I thank her and thank her saying she's the first person with United who's been any help to me all day. So I have the lady at the desk print it for me and I'm all set to go. I get on the plane, no issue, sitting a good 20 or so rows ahead of my family and right as we're about to take off a security woman comes down the aisle, addresses me by name and says, ?You need to come with me. You have not paid for this flight and you need to be going to Syracuse. You cannot go to another state Orange County is in another state.?

And I said I know exactly where Orange County is and where Syracuse is but I've already sorted this out and I have my boarding pass, it's right here, United printed it out for me just 20 minutes ago. And she said no look and she points to four letters at the top of the ticket - PTKT - and says that makes it not valid and it means you haven't paid for this flight. I ask if anyone else was scheduled to be in this seat and she said no but you still can't sit there we can't take you to Orange County for free. I say you aren't taking me for free I paid you $420 for my flight months in advance. She says I need to go now and I figure I could get myself in much hotter water than I am already so I get my stuff and go.

So my family still hasn't noticed what's going on because they're so far back and I yell to my sister as I'm standing in the aisle getting my bag, ""HEY, I'll make it to California. ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT EVERYONE."" As I exit the plane I say to one of the stewardesses, ?Would you mind at least explaining to my family why you've taken me off the plane? And then I'm standing in the jetway expecting to talk my way back onto the plane. The woman says I need to go to Syracuse. I said, ?If you had actually done your homework you'd see that your company cancelled my flight from CLEVELAND, not Chicago, to Syracuse over 24 hours ago, and this is how the woman on the phone fixed it for me, because you ruined my travel plans and made it impossible for me to get from Syracuse to Orange County on time.? She kept saying ""Syracuse and Orange County are in different states"" and I said I KNOW. Then it started to dawn on me how long I'd been on the defensive, and I was tired and frustrated, and I burst into tears.

?You humiliated me in front of a hundred people, you took me away from my family, I haven't seen them in over a year between school and travel and work and I just want to go with them to see my aunt in California.? They escort me out of the jetway and I follow a guy in a dumb looking suit to the desk in front of the gate and say how are you going to fix this? And he says I'm printing you a boarding pass for Chicago-Syracuse. This gets me into Syracuse at 9pm. I say, ?Have you not been listening to me? This is absolutely useless to me. My flight from Syracuse to CHICAGO is leaving at 4 pm IN ONE HOUR.? He said, ?You'll have to figure it out with American Airlines from there. I tell him that I and other customers pay United an awful lot to be treated like livestock.? I take the boarding pass but go back to the American Airlines counter and ask if the boarding pass I was given in the morning, the one for Santa Ana at 6:50 pm, is actually a boarding pass and if I'll be able to get on the plane, and they say yes your boarding pass is valid. I say thank you and find a corner with some carpet and nap for a while, read a bit, and cry now and then because I'm just stressed out and tired of being alone.

That flight is delayed about an hour but sure enough I get on the plane and it leaves the ground without anyone coming on and making a fool of me. I get into California around 10pm West Coast time - I have now been awake for almost 20 hours - and my aunt picks me up and takes me to the house where I pass out on the couch for the night. Now I?m with family and I?m glad to be, but I want justice. I want to spread this story and give United Airlines the publicity it deserves, and I hope the Internet can help me out with that.

*Maybe if I was an Olympic athlete, they would have treated me better?*

**TL;DR: I tried to get my flight changed with United Airlines after they cancelled one of my flights, they printed me a boarding pass and I got on the plane, they escorted me off saying I hadn't paid.**"

Current bucket list:

* Australia \(Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Great Barrier Reef, Whitsunday Islands, possibly Perth and Uluru/Ayers Rock\)
* New Zealand \(Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch\)
* Hike Inca Trail to Machu Picchu
* Dominican Republic \(for [this beauty](https://www.aman.com/resorts/amanera)\)

...and that's it. Those four would be some pretty great trips, but I'm looking for inspiration for where else I should travel. I've heard great things about Croatia, anyone here recommend it? I would also love to explore South America \(never been, and apart from Machu Picchu, I'm interested in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina\).

What do I like? I'm an adrenaline junkie, so roller coasters, ziplines, and anything thrilling is great. I love nature and adventure, so hikes are also amazing, especially those with a view. That being said, I feel the most at home in cities  as there is so much to do. Often my travel consists of some really relaxing do\-nothing days and some jam\-packed exploring days \(usually in cities\).

For flights, I try to stick with Star Alliance member airlines \(all while trying my best to avoid United\), but I've had great experiences with KLM, BA, Emirates, and Cathay Pacific, so those are all options. I'm based in Toronto, Ontario but will soon be moving to the Bay Area, so YYZ is my home airport, but that will soon change to SFO. In terms of accommodation, I don't couchsurf and could count on one hand the number of times I've used an AirBnB. I prefer SPG hotels \(brand loyalty is rewarding\) but would love to further experience different Aman properties \(so if anyone has been to any Aman Resorts, I'd love to hear about it\).

In case it helps, some of my favourite places I've been are Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, French Polynesia, the UK, Kenya, Tanzania, and the US. The only place I didn't really enjoy was Vietnam, but it's likely that's because I had just been in Thailand and preferred that by a long shot. The only countries I want to avoid are those on the Government of Canada's travel advisory list as ""Avoid all travel"", which are the usual culprits \(Syria, Yemen, Burundi, Somalia, Central African Republic, Afghanistan, Iraq, DPRK, Libya, Mali, South Sudan, Chad, and Niger\)

In terms of languages, I'm fluent in English and French, and can read/write but not speak very well in Spanish and Swedish.

So, what do you suggest I add to my bucket list?"

We would be flying into Rome, and out of Milan (via Chicago).

Note that for the long-haul flight, I'm sticking with airlines like United, British, American, as opposed to budget. Once we're in Europe, it's whatever is cheapest.

Does anyone have any experiences (good or bad) booking a bunch of separate flights? Am I any more or less likely to run into coordination issues? As I've been choosing flights, I've been giving us several hours between to account for delays.

Any thoughts would be helpful.

PLEASE HELP REDDIT!"|"So my wife and I were overseas for a wedding in Ireland, when she got a call that there was a possible job available for her back in the states.  A few Skype interviews later and she got it!  So we immediately started scrambling for a new flight for her to get back in time (flying into LAX instead of SFO).  After finding several fares online for $0 fare difference and $300 change fee, I tried to book one, but the website would not cooperate.  So we went the phone route, and the representative couldn?t find a $0 fare difference, but found one for $200-ish.  I, being cheap, said we would call back, as the tease of the numerous $0 flights taunted me from my computer.  I kept trying the internet, to no avail.  Back onto a Skype phone call with United, where the representative found a flight that had $0 fare difference and $300 change fee.  HUZZAH!  I felt vindicated and proud that my cheapness paid off (who wouldn?t want an extra $500 in their bank account, especially when you?re hemorrhaging money overseas??).  So we booked it through the agent, enjoyed the wedding, and flew home separately.

Part 2:  We get home and notice that there is a $993 charge on our Chase card (United Mileage Plus) in addition to the $300 charge for the change fee.  I ring up United and they say that this is the fare difference.  I tell them that there was no fare difference when we spoke to the representative and that we would be contesting the charge with Chase.  Chase then got back to us and told us that United had confirmed that it was a valid charge so that didn?t work - their in bed together, big suprise.  I then called United back telling them again about the situation and how we were being swindled and they told me to submit a Customer Service Refund Request, so I did.  They quickly got back to me saying ?Unfortunately, we are unable to honor your request and would like to explain why. Our records show the ticket was used; therefore, no refund is due.?  Grrrrr.  

So here we are.  Out of an extra thousand dollars and nowhere to turn.  I'm searching for another plan of attack to get back what is rightfully ours.  My only hope is that United has some sort of recording of the conversation I had with them so I can prove that the representative said we had a $0 change fee.

Help me Reddit Wan Kenobi, you?re my only hope?

TL;DR - United promised me a $0 fare difference, then charged me $993."

I may regret my decision once I'm at the airport, but for now my desire to change things up has won out.

I am taking a trip from Houston to Naples, Italy in December... again.  
This will be my 7th time in 18 months. Typically I've flown with Lufthansa with a few other airlines mixed in occasionally (United/Canada/Brussels) Unfortunately military pay (hubby is stationed over there) doesn't allow for frequent international travel in anything nicer than economy. If you can imagine I'm feeling a bit worn with the monotonous 8-10 hour knee stiffening flights, and I'm feeling a bit tired of LH just in general.

* What I'm asking is, from your experience, for the long haul flights, (I couldn't really care less about the shorter ones) is Lufthansa economy, or United economy PLUS better? I've never taken United on a long haul so that one's new to me. I do know if it was between econo, and econo, I'd stick with Lufthansa, but is the infamous American airline worth the sacrifice for the leg room on a 9ish hour flight?

I do know that Lufthansa is implementing a new premium economy, but I can only seem to get it for the outgoing itinerary. The return will only let me book business, which unfortunately is not financially an option.

The vouchers must be used by August this year, and we will be flying out of LAX. We basically have all of **July** free and would be happy to spend the full month away - and it doesn't have to be limited to USA, just the $1000 for two tickets.

Some context: I live in Asia and had a flight scheduled to go back to the US for a weekend where I was standing up in my best friend's wedding. There were two actually -- an Air Japan flight to Tokyo and another to the U.S. -- but both booked directly through United's website. However, when I arrived to the airport, each airline's check-in counter kept sending me to the other, claiming that I had to check-in with the opposite airline. They looked at my email confirmation, receipts, passport, made phone calls and yet still, nobody could figure out which airline I was supposed to check-in with. This back-and-forth ate up so much time that eventually the gate closed, the plane took off, and I still didn't have a boarding pass from either airline. I think it goes without saying that this was a fucking mortifying experience -- being a best man, my presence at this wedding was non-negotiable, and United didn't have any other flights that would allow me to make it on time, so I had to book with a third airline on the spot for 2x the cost. 

Fast forward to now, I submit a refund request for the cost of the ticket and United tells me a fee of $138 will be applied because I booked a nonrefundable ticket. I know that it wasn't technically an ""emergency"" situation (i.e. death or jury duty), but still feel like it's a special circumstance and was due to the incompetence of both airlines. It's not like I cancelled because my plans changed or I just didn't feel like taking the flight anymore. 

Any advice on how I could get this fee waived? I've tried calling twice so far, but no luck.

We keep our kids entertained, fed or quiet. But this time the airline doesn't have seats together. ANY. SEATS. TOGETHER. Suggestions?"|"Let me start by saying, yes, we should have planned the trip sooner. But because of work and school schedules, we weren't able to get tickets until all side-by-side seats were all sold out. So now the four of us are spread around the cabin willy-nilly.

In the few times we've run into this before (for 1 seat only), we usually find someone willing to inconvenience themselves and move to another seat. I am SO grateful to those people because they bought a ticket, chose a seat and that should be the end of it. And I always offer to buy them a drink or something from the inflight menu. All have declined with a smile.

But this time it's 3 people we'll be inconveniencing.

My initial thought is to bring some loose bills and offer each person who moves a $50 and my eternal thanks.

"2016-09-27 18:29:15"|"First international flight and I have no idea how any of this works."|"If this isn't the right place for this please let me know!

I am getting married this Saturday (yay!) and we are flying from the US to London on Sunday for our honeymoon.  Neither of us has ever been out of the country and I have no idea how any of this works as far as navigating the airport, baggage, security, etc. and I'm pretty nervous.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

1.  We are flying out of CLT Sunday night and we have an hour and 20 minute layover at IAD, and we fly from there to LHR.  Do we go through international security checkpoints and whatnot in CLT or in IAD?  Is the hour and 20 minutes enough time for all of that?  Flying home we leave LHR and have a layover at MUC for 2 hours, is this the same process to get back into the US?


2.  Both flights to London from Charlotte are United Airline flights, and we will have two checked bags.  Will we need to recheck them in DC or will they just move them for us?  Our flights home are both Lufthansa, but I've read somewhere we will have to recheck baggage to get back into the US, is this true?

Thanks in advance for any answers!"

"2017-02-13 03:11:35"|"Transatlantic Flights-Tips and Hacks"|"As a seasoned traveller between the UK and the United States. I have picked up several tricks that help to make the 6-12 hour journey more relaxing. Feel free to add your own ideas as well. This is just a list of my own experiences.

**Before you get to the airport**

* **Shower**
Before you even leave home, take a shower, no one likes BO especially in an enclosed space. Also try and bring spare clothes and roll-on deodorant in your cabin baggage to freshen up onboard.
* **Give plenty of time to travel**-
They say the journey begins as soon as you leave home, so try to be as relaxed as possible before leaving, whether driving, taxi or catching a train to the airport. Allow an extra hour or maybe two to make sure you have plenty of time in case of traffic/delays. If possible stay at a hotel near the airport (especially with early morning UK-US flights) thus reducing your overall travel time.
* **Eat before you get to the airport**-
An early morning (UK-US) or evening (US-UK) flight leaves a long time since your last meal, the time spent in the airport and before you are served your in-flight meal will make you hungry. Eating a plentiful meal before will fill you up and stop you going hungry if your in-flight meal (jokes aside) is unappetising. Watch what you eat as well, bad smells in an enclosed space are not well received. Buying food before getting to the airport will also save money as in the next rule..
* **Buy any necessities before you go**-
Granted there are shops in the airport that sell things you need try to buy them from your local retailer. Remember security restrictions with liquids (suncream and the like).

**At the airport**

* **Use online check-in**-
This is a no brainer. Simply if your airline offers it, use it. It saves plenty of time and beat several hundred people through security.
* **Check-in early/late**-
Both methods can help you dodge the inevitable queues at the check in. But it depends on the time check-in opens).
If it is very early morning (before rush hour 8-9am) check in first. Your bags may get loaded first and offloaded last but you can get through a quieter security. You may have longer to wait, but it is better sitting in departures than stuck in a long queue. Late check in grants you first offload status at the end of your flight but best bet is to be at the airport early and just chill for a while before checking in.

**At the airport**

* **Use charging ports**-
With time to kill you will inevitably use your phone/tablet/handheld games console etc. The 2/3 hours spent on them may drain the battery and with an 8/12 hour flight ahead, the battery may run out before you arrive so charge your devices fully before leaving home then if you use them, recharge them as much as you can.
* **Use the toilet just before you board**-
You never know how long it will be before you can use the onboard toilets but best bet is go before, there will be a small rush in the air when everyone wants to go first and with unexpected turbulence you may not get the chance to go.
* **Arrive at the gate early but board late**-
Getting to the gate early stops a last minute dash before the doors close, but once boarding commences everyone rushes to get on first. If you wait as long as possible everyone else will have found their seats and sat down and not blocking the aisles. Just remember to be not too late and annoy the rest of the passengers.

**In the air**

* **Don't take off your shoes/socks**
Just don't, you may have showered before you went to the airport (please do) but them being in shoes for several hours will kick up a stink. If you have brought slippers, then that is ok.
* **Be considerate of nearby passengers**
Generally don't be an dick to the people you are going to sit with for over 6 hours. Talk quietly, don't recline back (ask first) and if you don't sit on an aisle, limit trips to the toilet/friends etc.
* **Bring snacks**
If the inflight meal seems too long away, you may be tempted to buy snacks from the galley. The same captive market rules apply, bring food from home (no smelly/allergy foods) and consume or dispose of them before you land (any foods that may be prohibited meat/fruit etc).
* **Stay healthy**-
Spending over 6 hours sat in one spot is not good for your body, try to stretch your muscles maintain blood flow to your legs (avoiding DVT) and even take small walks around the cabin. Just remember to be considerate of others.
* **Have all necessary documentation ready BEFORE you land**
Have your documents ready and easily accessible for immigration and customs saves time and stress when on the ground and stops last minute panics as you fumble for your passport in your bag.

**After landing**

* **If near to the exit, get off as quick as possible**
It will help you avoid the queue at immigration. However if you are several rows away, just be patient. No one likes to be cooped up for 9 hours but just a few more minutes won't hurt. 
* **Remember when you checked-in**
This can help you when to collect your bags, if you checked in first, your bags will most likely appear on the carousel last. It also helps stop people blocking access to the carousel and stop people from getting their bags off.

**Who:** I am in the process of booking a trip for my fiancee and me for early May. We are mid twenties and live in New York.

**Past Travel:** My fiancee has never been out of the US and is the main reason why I want to take an international trip. I have been to Croatia/Hungary, United Arab Emirates and Germany. I would like to try something new.

**Length/Budget:** ~ 1 Week, ~2000 dollars (Not including Airfare). I should note that I have a ton (~200k Mileage plus Miles) and am practiced in getting rewards flights so airfare costs should be minimal.

**All Inclusive vs City Travel:** Here is my number one question. I want to travel somewhere that has a ""foreign feel"", but I do not want to have the whole backpacking feel to it either. For example, I did Berlin/Budapest/Zagreb and really enjoyed that trip, but think it will be too much for my S.O.

I want a relaxing vacation such as one you find in the Caribbean at a chain ""All Inclusive"" resort, but I still want to feel like I am out of the country. I hope this makes sense. My fear is that if I go to the Carribean, I will not have that same ""foreign feel"" that I had when I was in Croatia or UAE.

I guess what I am asking of is a single stop (no multi-city), vacation which will certainly feel like I am far away from NYC, but at the same time I do not want to be in a different city every 2 days running around from hotel to hotel sticking to a very packed sightseeing itinerary.

**Interests:** I have a strong interest in history and architecture. Fiancee is has a conversational command over Spanish, and I have very basic French.

**Current Ideas:** Right now I am thinking about Greece, France (non-Paris), or a less ""commercialized"" Central American Country. I am all over the place though, I need some refinement.
Any suggestions for a low-stress* vacation that still has more of an ""international"" feel to it than something in Jamaica or Dominican Republic would have?

Please let me know if you have any questions and I appreciate any suggestions. I am open to anything, and the Airline miles really allow me many options."

I'm definitely within the weight limitations but I'm wondering just how strict they are about sizes. Are bags actually measured?

"2016-12-29 02:59:20"|"Hi /r/travel... flying United before the end of January? I'm giving away some global premier upgrades that I won't be able to use (upgrade from economy to first or business class anywhere in the world) and one domestic (US only) first class upgrade to a few lucky people! Happy Cinco de Hannukah!"|"Hi all!

I traveled quite a bit for business in 2015, and that afforded me 1K status on United for all of 2016. With that status I was gifted a bunch of coupons for first/business class upgrades, both internationally and domestically. I've used most of my domestic upgrades, but haven't had the occasion to use the international ones. I don't work for united, I'm not an affiliate, not in the travel industry... just a satisfied patron of the airline that doesn't have travel plans in the near future. I'd love to use them, but it looks unlikely, and United won't let me keep 'em.

These upgrades expire at the end of January, so I figured that I'd take to the internet and see if I could bequeath these to a few deserving folks. 

If you're interested... tell me where you're going, how many upgrades you need, and why I should pick you!

**A few things to note:**

**1)** These upgrades cannot be transferred from account to account like miles can. In order for me to gift these upgrades I must ""sponsor"" you - this requires me to have your last name and confirmation number. From there, I can redeem the upgrade from *my* account to *your* reservation. So, it requires a little bit of trust from a random stranger. To be helpful here, I'm willing to talk on the phone/verify who I am before you pass along information, if that matters to you. Otherwise, you can just know me as UpgradeAngel.

**2)** These upgrades are instantaneous for some flights, and some flights only have wait list available. If you already have flight plans booked, I will be able to tell right away if this will work instantaneously. If you haven't booked your travel yet, there is no way for me to see if the upgrade cannot be redeemed instantaneously. If a flight is waitlisted, I can call United and find out the chances of the upgrade going through, based on my (your) position on the upgrade list and availability in premium cabins, which I am willing to do.

**3)** These upgrades will only work on travel that will be completed before January 31st. So, if your flight is after January 31st, I can't sponsor your itinerary.

**4)** These upgrades will not work for tickets booked with award travel.

If you have some friends that you know are traveling or that you'd like to help out, show them this thread and let's see if we can make some magic happen together!"

But though their knack for piss-poor customer service has grabbed the limelight as of late, there?s another company making its way up the ranks?and their nefarious antics are going largely unchecked.


**Rats With Wings**

Time and time again, people are personally reminded why United is consistently rated one of the worst carriers in the world. From lost bags to delayed flights to unannounced cancellations, they take the cake in regards to negligence.  But everything else they do wrong pales in comparison to one sole aspect: how they treat their customers.

Their [twitter feed.](https://twitter.com/united/with_replies) Their [Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/United) Their [Google search results.](https://www.google.com/search?q=united+customer+service&oq=united+customer+service&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l5.2342j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=united+customer+service+reviews) The internet is chock-full of complaints and rants about just how bad United?s customer service is. Time and time again you see customers who have been [stuck on hold for several hours](http://i.imgur.com/R3Awy0S.png) only to have their [call dropped or redirected to the very beginning](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/united-airlines-mileageplus/1554099-united-dropped-calls-cant-call-back.html).  Asking for a manager automatically places you on hold for 30 minutes or more (go ahead, try it yourself).  And more often than not your complaint is met with a ?please fill out the feedback form online? which takes up to 14 business days for them to respond to, as if they?re purposely delaying their response so you have enough time to forget the details of your complaint.

Before last month, I didn?t have any reason to believe that United was as bad as everyone said it was. Then United sold me a faulty ticket and nearly stranded my family in Morocco.

 
**How United Stole $168 From a Baby**

Over the past year I?ve used United's frequent flyer program to book countless flights with their StarAlliance partners around the world?not without problems, but nothing I?ve ever found to be worth complaining about. As I've flown with my wife and my toddler-age son, we?ve always paid for adult tickets with points and paid the full price for the lap-child ticket.  There has not been a single incident with this method, and each time we used United.com or their booking phone line to book the flight and the tickets transferred to the partner airline without fail.  That?s why it was so odd to us that, when we tried to check in our child?s ticket at the front desk at the Casablanca Airport, he suddenly didn?t exist.

Even after pulling together every shred of evidence that we in fact had purchased the ticket, the ticket number United gave us and the [$55 bill in my account](http://i.imgur.com/ImiGn7D.png) was not enough for the airline to let us on the plane?quite simply, United did not issue the ticket for my son on the partner airline.  Perhaps if we didn?t have two transfers to make after this flight in order to get to our destination in Cape Town, I would have waited at the airport for United to resolve the issue ?properly?.  Instead, knowing that it would possibly be over a week before the next available flight (and knowing that they would not refund us the two adult tickets if we stayed), we were more or less forced to either buy a last-minute ticket for our kid or be stuck indefinitely.  Total cost of the new ticket equaled to $112.98, and despite arriving to the airport 3 hours early we made it on the plane with just a handful of minutes to spare.

I managed to contact United via Twitter during this incident since I couldn't call them while in the midst of all this. Though they confirmed that the ticket for my son existed on their end, they took 20 minutes in between each response and ultimately decided [my complaint would be best handled by me filling out a request form for a refund on the ticket I purchased through them](http://i.imgur.com/FCRqlkw.png).  But I didn?t want a refund on the $55 ticket that was supposed to work - I wanted my money back for the last-minute ticket they forced me to purchase.

Fast forward to 3 weeks later. By this time I?ve spent nearly 10 hours on the phone, written dozens of emails, contacted them through every form of social media (which I realize gets me nowhere but I just wanted to make a stink), filed forms for both complaints/feedback and refunds, and not only have they still refused to pay for the $113 ticket, they won?t even refund me the faulty $55 ticket that was never able to be used.  Instead, after all of my efforts in garnering a proper response, they offered a $50 voucher redeemable on any United-only flight? [a ?gesture of goodwill?, they tell me](http://i.imgur.com/A7EhFGp.jpg), as apparently none of this is their fault.  Hope in actually getting my money back at this point is nearly absent.


**United Wipes Their Butts With Customer Complaints**

The worst part about all this isn?t the loss of money, or the personal mistreatment and neglect I?ve encountered during this entire ordeal.  The worst part is that my story is not unique: thousands of people this year alone have been unforgivingly slighted by United Airlines, and some have lost out on much more than $168 bucks.  And it continues unchecked, as if United believes they cannot be stopped.

And maybe they?re right; after all, everything we?ve heard about Comcast recently has proven that your complaints only matter if they?ve gone viral like [Dan Furia?s](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2duzfi/comcasts_corporate_response_to_my_recent_reddit/)? and sometimes even that doesn?t work, such as in [Gary O?Reilly?s case](http://www.inquisitr.com/1504720/comcast-home-security-customer-service/).  Where businesses are supposed to suffer tremendous consequences for bad customer service, these mega-corporations have proven that even with literally the worst reputation in America they can turn a profit. There is no check-and-balance, and they are only getting worse.

I don?t expect to see my money back, and I will be sure to avoid United as best as I logically can in the future.  But that doesn?t solve the underlying problem: United is going to do the same thing to someone else a hundred times over and never be held accountable, and simply ?not flying United? just isn?t enough to stop it."
"2017-04-16 14:30:53"|"Thanks for nothing, Delta"|"Nothing would make me happier than getting this to the front page...
A week or so ago, tornadoes hit near Atlanta, completely snarling airline traffic. My flight to India was the next day. Understandably, Delta had to reroute my flight through United/Lufthansa. No problem, I even got upgraded on the way to Frankfort. Unfortunately, they decided to change my return tickets without notifying me, so I wasted 3 hours last night running all over Delhi airport because nobody could find the ticket that I paid for. Finally, I was able to reach my travel agent and she helped Delta figure out their screw-up. I ended up having to be escorted through the diplomatic queue in customs so I could make my flight. (Side note: don't try to hug a Indian woman to thank her. They don't like it)
Anyway, here I sit in Heathrow, waiting for my flight back to 'Murica so I take to the twitters to voice my displeasure. Hilarity ensues:
Me- thanks for almost leaving me stranded in Delhi, guys...

Yesterday our flight was delayed 3 and a half hours on united in the US. after trying to figure everything out the flight only ended up being 30 minutes late and the attendant promised us we had plenty of time to make our connection. Then.. we arrive in chicago and there's no gate for our plane... that took another 20 minutes. They also changed the plane so when we got off we had to wait another 15 minutes to get our carry on luggage that was stowed under the airplane. 

At the point I'm sure you can guess that we missed our connection to Ireland. And that airline only has one flight to Ireland a day. So here we are.. stuck in chicago for 24 hours. I saved for months to splurge on a hotel in Dublin..and lost out on that money due to having to cancel less than 24 hours in advance. 

We were planning on taking a flight from dublin to paris on the 31st to get there for New Years Eve so now the airline got us a flight out tonight to arrive in paris on the 31st... but we have a 30 minutes layover in dublin... so 30 minutes to change fucking planes, and we can't sit together on the eight hour flight. . 

Thank you, United for such a great start to my honeymoon. We no longer get to see ireland, I'm out 300 for a hotel and we'll be lucky to even make it to Paris. I will never fly with you again. "

* We would be traveling from the US (Florida) 

Some questions that we have:

* We're considering the Eurail pass, but is there a better means of transportation between cities and countries?
* I don't even know where we start in creating the budget for this. I was thinking about trying to keep it around $6,000 not including airfare (we have many thousands of airline miles that we'll probably make use of for this), but I don't know if that's a realistic number. Any pointers on this front?
*And most importantly, what are the best places to visit in these countries? What are some good restaurants, hidden away little shops, etc?

I'm the most interested in hearing your stories and opinions on the best places to visit while we're there. We're cost conscious, but it's not the highest thing on the list. Mostly, we just want to have a good time! Redditors, HALP! :)

Oh...I almost forgot. I was thinking about starting this in Lisbon, because it seems like the cheapest place to fly into at that time of year, but I'm open to suggestions. It would be a one way flight, with us ending our trip in a different city, and then flying out of there.

"2017-12-10 11:00:17"|"Wife's maiden name on ticket, already updated passport"|"Hello all.  First, I wanted to state that I already searched the subreddit and found older threads with similar but different questions.  Most are about traveling with a passport that has a maiden name on it. Basically the opposite of my problem.

Some details: Several months ago, I booked a trip via United Airlines using points.  The flight is in mid January, over a month away.  We are both US citizens.  No flights are on United, only other Star Alliance airlines. The ticket was purchased with my wife's maiden name.  We have since been married, and I noticed her passport was set to expire in August.  I believe that many countries require six months of validity before expiration when you travel.  While all of our travel is in January, I wanted to be safe and update her passport in the event of extenuating circumstances.  I did some research, and saw that United will make name corrections in the event of legal name changes.  With this information, we went ahead and renewed her passport under her new last name.

We just received the updated passport in the mail, and I called United to make the change.  They stated that they are unable to make changes on the tickets because the tickets are through the Star Alliance partners (Lufthansa, Thai Airways, Air Canada). They said they made an OSI notation on the ticket, but cannot force anything else. Had the tickets been on United operated flights, the change could have been made.  It is quite possible I misunderstood what was told to me before, but I thought I was doing the right thing.

I am now quite paranoid that we will not be able to travel. I am also rather upset with myself, as we likely would have been fine had we just not updated her passport.  Does anyone have any advice, or been in similar situations before? 

I have read some advice for similar issues, such as traveling with your marriage certificate.  I'm not sure how much help that will be to me in other countries though. We also have her license still in her maiden name, as well as her old passport that has been invalidated.  Is it worth contacting the passport agency and changing her passport back to her maiden name via expedited service? Would that set off more alarm bells? To further complicate things, I have already booked our domestic flights within Thailand using her new name.  So even if I somehow change her passport back to her maiden name, I'm worried about those flights as well.  Can I use her license as ID for domestic Thai travel?

Thank you for any help.  I apologize for such a long post, I wanted to include as many details as possible.  I really hope I didn't ruin our honeymoon.  With so many moving parts and different airlines it is such a headache. 

Update: I was able to speak with Air Canada and Lufthansa.  Both told me that they cannot make changes to the ticket, and any changes would need to occur with the issuing airline.  Air Canada said they have the same policy as United; they can amend a ticket with a legal name change, but only if the flights were booked through AC and all flights were through AC.  I called United again, and spoke to a supervisor.  They agree that what I was told before is correct, name changes can be made in United's system for United flights.  However, they can't do anything about alliance partners, and can't guarantee what their policies will be.  Any name change they make will get my wife's flight canceled on the other airlines.  They offered to cancel the flights and refund all points and fees, giving me the option to rebook with the updated name. However, this won't work as my flight options are very slim, and with far longer transit times. It seems I'm really in a difficult situation.  I asked them to make a notation in my account, and i would think about what I will do.  I'm now thinking it may be best I try contacting the passport agency near me and seeing if we can get a new passport in her maiden name.  I agree that the airlines probably will allow us to board if we bring as much backup info as possible, but it is a pretty big risk.  I'm going to be at the airport tomorrow as well, I will see if speaking to someone in person can yield any other results.  

Lesson learned, don't try to change passenger information, especially when multiple airlines are involved. I'd be happy to hear any other opinions on what my next steps should be. "

I'm not really traveling far. I'm just going from California to New Hampshire and I'd like some advice.  
I've never traveled anywhere via plane, nor I have I gone on a trip alone. So, doing both the for the first time, at the same time, is a little more than intimidating.  
I have checked out the ITA matrix and I probably know where I'll be buying my ticket from there.  
I just saw that there is now a link to the beginners guide to airports, and I will be checking that soon. (It wasn't a link when I checked it a few weeks ago.)  
  
SO! My main question is:  
Are there any airlines I should avoid?  
I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?  
  
Any other tips that the beginners guide may not tell me?  
  
Any scams I should avoid? ie. ""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""  
  
I'll add more questions later, in the meantime any other advice you can give me from what I stated would be appreciated. If you have any questions for me I will answer them as soon as possible.  "

So, I'm going to Brazil in September with a layover in Mexico city (both ways).

My uncle in Brazil used his flyer miles (or something) to pay for my airfare, and his wife finally gave me my flight details.  I expected to see good old United, which is the only airlines that my uncles uses when flying abroad.  Instead, I saw he picked AeroMexico, both ways.

Never having heard of AeroMexico, I did a simple Google search and got very worried.  Most of recent reviews are very bad, from ""lost seats"" to layover hell/missed connecting flight.  My main worry is having to buy a ticket if I happen to ""miss"" my connecting flight, since I won't be able to afford it.

Upon arrival in Germany, I retrieved my bags from the carousel to find a giant tear along the zipper of one of my checked bags.  Luckily, it appears I did not lose anything too important, at first glance.

My problem now is whom might I contact regarding this baggage handling?  I would like some form of compensation, at best a replacement luggage bag.  I booked my tickets through Vayama (who is of course not at fault) and the carrier listed for my flights was Air Canada.

The trip had three legs, all listed as Air Canada flights on my itinerary but through code-share airlines use, there were different carriers for each leg:

1st Leg) My hometown to Chicago - United ::::
2nd Leg) Chicago to Montreal - Air Canada :::::
3rd Leg) Montreal to Germany (final destination) - Lufthansa

Is Air Canada the airline which should be responsible for this?  The original baggage stickers I received were from United, and so those baggage numbers might not be in AC's system.  I did not have to re-check my bags at any point in my journey.  Any advice here whom I contact?

"2018-02-28 09:42:57"|"United will not issue a refund, what can I do?"|"I had a weekend trip back in November with two different airlines (virgin out, united back) where my outbound flight was canceled while I was in the terminal. After being unable to get a replacement flight out I had to cancel my return flight as I wasn't even remotely nearby to use it.

Before I even returned home virgin had given me travel credits worth more than my flight and also quickly refunded my ticket when I called them (although it was odd they didn't do both at once).

On the flip side I called United whereby their clearly foreign customer service was barely able to understand the fact that I wanted to cancel my flight let alone get a refund, but was informed that I had to ""apply"" for one instead of doing it over the phone. I did so and received this response 10 days (!) later:

> We're sorry to hear your plans changed. While the fare rules don't allow a refund or name change, you can exchange your ticket for future travel. A service charge as well as any applicable fare difference will be applied at the time of the exchange.

While I expected a small charge, the exchange fee was $200 out of the ~$230 fare (!!!!). This, to me is absurd, especially given the fact that the change in plans was completely out of my hands. It seems even more absurd (and downright corrupt) that they would charge almost 90% of the original flight as an exchange fee for a flight that they no doubt filled anyway without me being there.

TL;DR - had an outbound flight (via Virgin) canceled for a weekend trip while in the airport and had to cancel my return flight (via United) but they refuse to refund me and are trying to charge me 90% of the flight cost as an ""exchange fee"" to apply the rest to a different flight.

So, long story short, is there anything I can do here, besides never fly United again? I have absolutely no intention of trying to use the $30 left and would much rather tell them to go fuck themselves in whatever way costs them the most amount of money."

I'm refreshing the topic for new opinions and recommendations while providing a summary of 3 best options I found based on points/miles and travel perks vs cost of the card. 

**Assumptions:** /r/travel is on a tight budget,  will pay the monthly bill, use the card for day to day transactions while traveling, wants flexibility in getting and using miles or points, may use the credit card for supplemental insurance or emergency assistance.

**Credit Cards for Points and Traveling**
 
* [*Chase Sapphire Preferred*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=chase+sapphire+prefered)  - 1:1 points transfer to participating frequent flyer programs. 40,000 points if you spend $3,000 in the first 3 months.

NO travel insurance/assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 annual fee, waived for the first year. 15.99% APR, 0% first year.

* [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) - 40,000 bonus miles if you spend $1,000 in the first 90 days. Double miles on all purchases. $200,000 travel accident insurance. Trip cancellation/interruption coverage. Emergency Assistance.

     No foreign Transaction fees. $89 Annual fee, waived the first year. 14.99% or 18.99% based on credit, 0% for first year.

* [*United/Chase MileagePlus Explorer*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Chase+MileagePlus+Explorer) - 30,000 miles if you spend $1,000 on the first 3 months. 5,000 miles for an additional user. Double miles on United flights.  10,000 miles per calender year if you spend more than $25,000.  NO Travel insurance or assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 transaction fee, waived first year. 15.24% APR, NOT waived for first year.

**Other card considerations:** Other carrier specific cards (ie [Citi AAdvantage](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Citi+AAdvantage), [American Express/Delta SkyMiles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Delta+SkyMiles)) do not offer as much flexibility as other cards and have been disregarded. [American Express Platinum](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=American+Express+Platinum) has reduced their benefits and rewards over the last year without reducing the $450 annual fee. 

**tl;dr** I researched credit cards to be used for travel and found the [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) to be the best current option. What have been your experiences and what are your recommendations?

I have a United trip coming up to Europe that involves a flight on Austrian Airlines from Vienna to Amsterdam, and I am planning on using an Osprey Porter 46 as my carry on with no checked bags.

Size wise, I know this fits their carry on limits, however it also says they have a carry on weight limit of 8 kg.

It will be tough to stay under this limit for a 2 week trip (and the weight limit on the other 2 United flights are MUCH higher).

From a frequent traveller, here are some tips on how NOT to get shafted on seating when booking your next trip:

- Use a site like matrix.itasoftware.com to plan your trip. I prefer the old matrix1.itasoftware.com engine - less user friendly, but oh so flexible. It'll give you fully inclusive fares and let you do LOTS of fancy stuff like specify routings, airlines, number of stops, etc. It takes some work but you will find a great fare on here.
- Check the seatmaps! If you have a choice between two similarly priced flights and one only has middle seats while the other's wide open, take the second flight - you'll be more comfortable.
- Check seatguru.com for red lights on certain seats and airlines. Airlines like Spirit only offer 28"" of seat pitch^1 on some of their planes. And you thought the airline average 31"" seat pitch was bad...
- While you're on the airline's website, check into preferred/premium seating options. Most airlines nowadays offer the option to upgrade to exit rows, premium economy, etc for a set fee. Know your options!
- Once you figure out your flights, you can book directly by calling the airlines. Know the flight and seat numbers you want so you can say ""I want AC441 on this date, seat 13A."" 
- Book early, at least three weeks out. This will give you better fares, a better seat selection, and more time to shop around. 
- If you MUST book last minute (and it does happen), compare the flights that day. You can easily check seating charts for most airlines now, or pay for the priority access on free for all airlines like southwest.
- **NEVER leave your seat selection up to chance.** If you can pay for seating in advance (or in Southwest's case, priority boarding), do it, especially if you're travelling as a group. This will minimize the possibility of getting stuck in a middle seat, and the ""my boyfriend and I must sit together, can you trade your exit row aisle seat for my middle in the back next to the toilet?""^2 game. 
- **NEVER leave your seat selection up to chance.**  Yes, I'm putting in there twice. This is especially vital if you have kids - don't be that mom standing in the middle of the aisle with three kids desperately trying to get people around you to swap a prime aisle seat for your kid's middle ten rows back - it's inconsiderate and it adds extra stress to what's already a stressful situation.
- If you do get stuck in a situation where you want a seat swap, always offer the best seat to the person you're asking to trade. Window or aisle is better than middle, front is better than back. Also realise that no one HAS to swap. It's nice if they do, but you are not entitled to it. I know people that pick seats for very specific reasons like me - I'm claustrophobic as fuck and I will not swap from my window to an aisle or middle for that reason. If you ask someone to swap and they say no, accept it, don't throw a hissy fit because you can't sit next to your boyfriend for a few hours.
- If you're extra tall, stop bitching about the leg room on planes and do something about it. We all know it sucks, but there are things you can do to make it better. Book E+ on United, pay for an exit row (most airlines let you do this now), look at airlines that offer extra legroom like JetBlue.
- If you get stuck in a crappy seat, keep checking back, especially in the last week before your departure. This is when all the upgrades for frequent flyers come through, and they always have the best seats. I've gone from 28B to 13A (my favourite seat on the Airbus 319) just by checking back once a day to see if any seats opened up. 
- Truly frequent flyers might want to look into a subscription to ExpertFlyer.com which lets you set up alerts that will email you if an aisle or window seat becomes available. This site has saved my butt more than once.
- Sometimes, airlines offer what's called a Last Minute Upgrade (LMU) at checkin. If it's available, it's usually a pretty good deal - much cheaper than paying for business class up front, and especially nice for extra long/overnight flights. Don't discount it offhand because it costs money - if you're travelling solo and stuck in a middle in the back on an overnight flight, that LMU is your ticket to comfort and a good night's sleep.

Obviously we can't account for everything here - sometimes things just happen that are out of your control like equipment swapping. Make sure to check your reservation once in a while as you get closer to your departure dates, as sometimes the airlines will mess about with your seating, turning your prime reservation into a mess, or scattering your family around the plane. If this happens and you can't correct it online with the seatmap, CALL! Do not let them put you off with stuff like ""they'll fix it at the airport at checkin"". That will become ""they'll fix it at the gate"" which will become ""the FA will fix it"" which turns into ""just ask people around you to trade"". Do not let them put you off. If the first agent won't help you, hang up and call back until you find one who will (also known as Agent Roulette, a very effective strategy and one I've used myself to great success). 

1) [Seat Pitch](http://www.uk-air.net/seatpitch.htm) is the distance between the rows of seats and is measured from the back of one seat to the back of the seat behind, the measurements being taken from the same position on each seat. Don't assume that 31"" of pitch is the same across all airlines and planes - older planes often have thicker seats that take up more room, whereas newer planes will offer an extra inch or two of legroom for the same amount of seat pitch. Do your research!

2) I've had this exact scenario happen. I said no, told her to ask the person in the back if they'd like to come up to the front instead.

**TL;DR:** Book your seats in advance, keep checking back for better seats/airline shenanigans, don't leave it to chance on the plane.

I have a few questions about the flying process that I cannot seem to find an answer to online. This is my first time flying so I am hoping someone could help me understand some of these. The important details (I think) are that I bought the plane ticket from CheapOAir. There will be 2 stops, one within the United States and one in China. The three of these flights were bought at the same time as part of the same ticket, not separately. 

The flight looks like this

Cincinnati-Washington             With United

Washington-Beijing                 With Air China

Beijing-Chengdu                     With Air China

It was a digital ticket, nothing that was mailed to me and all that I have is an E ticket number and some Airline Confirmation numbers. 

My questions is this.
My Airport only has a check in for United, not Air China. Does that mean I will have to do a separate check in with Air China while in Washington or will I receive my boarding pass for all three flights from United at the start? 
I've been told that they are both part of some sort of alliance and I shouldn't have to do that or even move my bags to the new aircraft on my own. Is that true? Is so could someone explain the process? 
Does anyone have any experience with these two airlines on the same ticket?
Thanks!"

It would mean alot if you could help me out. Also feel free to correct me if I get anything wrong.

1. The website says that I'm allowed to carry two bags with each bag having maximum weight of 23kg and each bag having maximum combined width, height and length of 62 inches or 157 cm. How serious does the airline get about the size? The issue is that my bag isn't angular, it is curved on one side to provide more area to stuff things in. Measuring from the end of the curve makes me over the size, but measure from the edge makes under the limit.

2. Do bag regulations change when you're flying through different international airports?

3. What should I keep in mind while doing connections ? I will have around 3 hours in each airport 

4. What should i keep in mind during the immigration when i get off in the US? I'm travelling for education and have all the documents ready.

5. Do the planes have charging spots for phones and iPads?

6. Any pro tips ?

I have a hotel booked in Cebu which i havent been paying for and not able to get to for the last 4 days(2 due to delay and 2 due to lost baggage).  The weather delayed the initial flight which i can take, but the last 2 days is due to United and EVA airlines negligence.

Due to a 5 hour delay in LAX, Eva Air put me on a United flight for the rest of the trip.  This is where my bags got lost.  I even called Eva air at this point to make sure my bags would make it, they reassured me that they will arrive. 

 I arrived in Manila two days ago, bags werent here.  They said they would arrive tomorrow, so i missed another flight and had to pay for a room in Manila when i have a room in Cebu still waiting for me.  They told me to come back yesterday and theyll be here by 5pm.  Called them before i went and they confirmed they would be here.  I spent 10 hours at the airport yesterday and they never arrived (cancelled 6 hours of classes for my job).  

I talked to United, they said my bags were still in LAX. Why would they tell me to get them at the airport then?!  I then talked to EVA, they said they are in Taipei since the 15th (3 days ago!!!).  This has gone back and forth and for some reason the airlines refuse to contact eachother and figure it out.

Its now today and United says the bag is still in LAX.  EVA says its still in Taipei.  They have no idea when it will arrive.  Neither are taking responsibility and refusing any compensation for the 2 nights of hotels i had to stay in Manila while waiting for my bag that never came.  Now, i need to buy new clothes and toiletries.  Im exhausted, irate, and wish I never even came on this vacation.

Im heading to Cebu today to actually experience my vacation outside of an airport.  Its been 4 days of airports.  I doubt ill get any compensation and probably will never see my bag again.  This is a warning, stay away from United and EVA; they do not value you as a customer.

UPDATE:

EVA called about an untagged bag and asked if i had an inflatable bed in it. This was not my bag, my bag was tagged and has locks on it! They still dont know where it is, but they are claiming it is in possession of United. When asked about compensation for the new clothes i need to buy, they said to contact United even though EVA was who i booked my ticket from and is the only airline confirmed to be in possession of my bag from Chicago to LA. I dont know why they think it might be in Taipei, arent they supposed to scan the tags for each arrival and departure?!

UPDATE 2:

Bags were in United's hands, so I wont blame EVA.  United has no idea where my bags are still (day 3).  No offer of compensation for my lost luggage or hotels i stayed at because they told me my luggage would be arriving the next day.  They have no timeline when ill see them again.  At least they admit this now instead of having me wait for them for days.

I left to Cebu yesterday because i have no confidence in my bags being found.  Buying new clothes and toiletries today, going to swim with sharks tomorrow :).  Time for vacation!"

"2015-09-25 07:23:21"|"United Airlines or: How not to travel."|"This is a bit of a rant about the worst customer experience of my life. My girlfriend and I booked a flight a week ago through United. The flight used Air Canada and Swiss Airlines, but was all through United. After booking we got an e-mail saying that our reservation could take up to 24 hours to be confirmed through Swiss Airlines and to call United for more information.

We called United and were told that Swiss Airlines had to confirm our flight and that we would be notified if there were any problems. We never heard anything back from United and assumed all had gone smoothly. A few days later we noticed our credit card was never charged and called United. Our confirmation number no longer existed and our flight was canceled without us being informed.

We were told that we could rebook the same flight, but that the price was 300 dollars more per person. After going back and forth on the price for an hour we found out that the exact same flight was listed on the United website for $300 less (the original price we tried to pay a week prior). When I told the customer service rep this she said ""Fine, book it online then."" and hung up.

After booking online we once again received an e-mail saying that Swiss Airlines hadn't confirmed the flight and that we needed to call United. The first time I called United I was told that the flight was totally booked and the waiting list was full. We were told that we had to book another flight, but on the United website the flight we wanted was still available...so I called Swiss Airlines directly. They told me that they confirmed our flight and that everything looked fine on their end. I called back United and explained this...the customer service rep did not believe me and told me the flight was full. I insisted he call Swiss Airlines. After 45 minutes on hold, the rep hung up on me.

Once again I called back United, and explained the situation to another representative. He also told me the flight was sold out but agreed to call Swiss Airlines and put me on hold. 35 minutes later he came on the line and apologized to me saying that Swiss Airlines had confirmed our flight but for some reason the United computers weren't seeing that and he was unable to book our flight. He offered us a different flight....for 400 dollars more per ticket.

The representative told me that since Swiss Airlines confirmed our flight and United wasn't able to see that, that the issue could be fixed by technical support. He transferred me over to technical support where another representative told me that the flight was full and the waiting list full. I explained to her FIVE TIMES that the reason I was calling was because that wasn't true. I explained that Swiss Airlines confirmed the flight and she eventually agreed to call them.

When she got back on the phone with me (another 45 minutes) she apologized and said ""You're right, the flight is not full-- but the price of the flight has gone up and is now $300 more per ticket"". She told me that I would have to wait another 24 hours for them to confirm the flight at the new price and even then there was no promise the price wouldn't go up again. ALL THE WHILE the United website still displayed the original price we were told. I explained that we tried booking twice already and that since the problem was with United's computers that we shouldn't be responsible for paying the extra fee. Even Swiss Airlines confirmed multiple times that they CONFIRMED the flight for the price we wanted.

I was told that there was never any technical issue and that all the other reps who told me the flight was full misspoke and actually meant the tickets at the prices we wanted were full, and that we'd have to book at a higher price.

So after 5 hours on the phone, we don't have any tickets. We were constantly lied to, told we were wrong, etc... and even after Swiss Airlines confirmed our flight, United told us that the price was now more expensive and refused to work with Swiss Air or compensate us at all. DISGUSTING. Never again will I fly United."

What else can I possibly do to get it back?"|"I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to ask this question in, but I really don't know where else to turn.  My wife is completely distraught because the only decent item we actually own (don't have a loan on it) has been lost.  Here's the story:

Late last night my wife and I were flying home from a wedding when her purse, which was sitting on the floor, fell over during takeoff.  We heard a few things fall out and picked up what we could.  We thought we had picked up everything, but this morning my wife realized that her wedding ring was missing.  

She doesn't usually take it off in public places but last night she slipped it off to put on some hand lotion and she put it inside her purse.  So we're pretty sure that it was lost on the airplane when her purse fell over.  

So we've been frantically trying to get in touch with somebody at United who can help us out.  Apparently all requests like this have to go through their online lost and found form.  The (not so friendly) customer service reps refused to do anything other than repeatedly point me to the website and literally tell me ""good luck with that.""

So I drove back to the airport and spoke with the United Airlines customer service people who assured me that they would try to find it.  But honestly they didn't seem very optimistic about our prospects.  

Again, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I would **really** appreciate any help on this .  The ring is really unique to us - it's an antique from the 1920s (our favorite period of literature) and can't be replaced.  We were both teachers when we got engaged 4 years ago and I can't tell you how many extra hours of tutoring I put in to save up the money to buy the ring.

Edit: I also tried my arriving airport's lost and found.  No dice.

How the airline industry works."|"**Before you read the post, keep in mind that may not be relevant for someone who travels a few times during the year domestically within the United States to see family or for work. On the other hand the article was based and targeting international travelers. This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing.**


Back in the 80s and 90s shopping for air tickets was so much simpler. The airlines used to offer 3 fares. One for economy, one for business and one for first (for the airlines that offered it.) Everyone traveling economy for example would pay the same. (so no one was upset for paying more than the person next to them or some cousin who was bragging that paid less?) The reason about this was that when the tickets were ?paper? and were physical items most agencies would pre-purchase and then set a price of how much they wanted to sell for the traveling season. (which also leaded to black market too in some cases. Having strong ethnic agencies that used to monopolize their markets, buying huge amounts of ticket stock and selling it to higher prices with huge margin of profit since they could do that. They could buy lots of ticket stock, make reservations and be able to hold them for weeks (can?t do this now), or book fake names to hold the space in flights and then change the name to whoever was traveling since there was so easy and without fees to change the names of the travelers.


What changed?


The airlines hated the fact of scheduling flights that could cost thousands of dollars without knowing if the flights will be full and sometimes sending half empty planes. They removed the paper tickets and changed the game. They introduced the ?classes of service?! If let?s say on a flight there are 300 seats, and the cabins are broken down to 30 business class tickets, 70 premium economy and 200 economy tickets, each cabin is broken down to classes of service. Economy for example, those 200 seats are divided to a dozen of different economy fares that change every 9 tickets are sold. Example 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F 9G. The first 9 people will call they will buy at the price of the A class that may be $800, next 9 travelers will pay the higher tier economy, B which may be $900 etc. The highest economy may be at $1800-2000 and this is the same cabin and the same seats that someone paid probably $800 or less. The way this system works, benefits the airlines since the travelers must rush and try to buy way ahead of time to make sure they ll get the lowest economy class of service or else they will end up paying way more. The travelers cant wait till last moment anymore when there was only one economy fare out there. So it is a game between all of us the travelers. Whoever calls first and the earliest gets the good fares. On top of that, when you make get a reservation now days, you cant hold it for more than 1-2 days. (before the agents could hold them for weeks). Not to mention the penalties. Most tickets are non refundable (with an exception of death). All tickets have penalties when you try to change them and the list going on. Keep in mind in domestic and international tickets, the lowest ones (lowest classes of service) come with some harsh rules behind them. Such as you don?t get miles or you can accumulate a very low amount of them. You are not allowed to travel with a luggage (unless you pay extra at the airport). Usually those tickets are non refundable and non changeable. (If you must change something, then you lose the ticket and you have to buy new one). Not to mention you can pre-select your seating assignment. 


When buying tickets be very careful. For domestic traveling always go directly to the airlines. They keep that portion of market for themselves. Which means, you aren?t going to get a better deal anywhere else. For international traveling though, all the airlines are giving a big portion of their deals and discounted fares to consolidators and wholesalers that they provide smaller agencies and websites with airfares. So when it comes to international traveling, then you may get a lower fare from an A Airline via an agency or a website than the airline itself. (Because the A Airline may have an agreement with the B travel agency to give them the right and sell their discounted deals). Many are complaining about the fares and fees. Well traveling is not a cheap ?sport? any more. As about the competition, well, someone may say ?but there are so many airlines?. True, but most of these airlines have merged into bigger alliances. The world?s major carriers have merged into 3-4 big groups that they expanded their ?city service networks? and share price and policies. So instead for 20-30 airlines, they are basically 3. So for us the consumers, we get the one or the two of them from each city. (this mean we get 1 or 2 fares to pick from) The one or the other airline alliance. (some major cities are luckier because they may get all 3 alliances plus some other ethnic carriers that don?t belong to any of the big groups and they are just offering an extra choice of airfare. 


Seating Assignment has become a joke too now days. It used to be free, yet the past years the airlines discovered this idea to sell the seating pre-assignment. You buy your tickets on April to travel in June and you want to assign the seats. You have to pay a fee. (Makes me wonder what we will pay next). Luckily you can go get the free seat assignment at the airport the day of your departure.
Travel insurance. Often I get asked about it. Another way for the agencies to make profit. Most airlines and the trip insurances waive and forgive penalties if you are very sick. But only if you are sick. Neither the airlines nor the travel insurance will cover you for any other reason. (yet many don?t realize this and buy insurance anyways). Some major airlines will cover you and waive the fees if you are really sick, so no reason to buy any insurance. Unless of course you booked with one of the few carriers that do not accept medical reasons for cancellations or changes. Then it is worth it. Although most of the times it is a waste of money. You end up paying way too much and sometimes it is not needed if the airline covers you for medical reasons anyways. 
Nothing is guaranteed either. Penalties, fares, fees, all are subject to change. Even your paid seating assignment. Basically the airlines under their guidelines can do anything they want and you can?t do a thing about it. 


When you try to book keep in mind to search for at least 4-5 months in advance from the month you want to travel. (this is for international tickets, not domestic tickets within the U.S.) The airlines have introduced this term called ?advance purchase? which it works to discourage travelers and overcharges them if they try to call within a week or two from their desired departure date to buy tickets. If let?s say an economy ticket cost $1000 (if you book it a month or more in advance). If you try to buy the same ticket within three or four weeks, or like sometimes people do, within one or two weeks the price skyrockets. That same ticket ends up costing $2000-$3000. So try avoiding booking within a week or two and last minute tickets. It was a time that worked well for deals, but not anymore. 


So what about the Special Sales?


Prices go down once in a while too, as sales/demand mandates. The airlines monitor their flights and once the sales drop, in order for the to fill the flights they release ""special sales"" to fill up the flights. Remember the goal is to send the aircraft full.


These hints and tips are applying mainly to the big carriers. (such as Delta, United, American, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, etc). Low cost carriers such as Spirit, Southwest, Ryan Air etc that sell tickets directly from their websites and not through any of the official reservation platforms around the globe, they are a different story and most of the above information isn't applying for them.


I am sure there are certain exceptions to all the above but this is how the airline industry works now days, the majority of the times. Hope it helps. Good ticket hunting."

Going to be 40 this year, and have been dreaming about this trip for over 20 years. Finally applied for my passport, and we have flats picked out in London and Paris. We know what we want to do, so no, AutoModerator, we aren't looking for advice for London or Paris.

My hangup is the flight.

I haven't flown much in my life, less than ten total flights. I have a bit of a height issue (I wouldn't call it fear), and I don't like not being in control. The safety record is well known to me, but still it persists. There's two areas that I could use some advice/feedback on.

**Comfort:** It takes a perfect scenario for me to get to sleep. I am a stomach sleeper, as much as I've tried to change that. I doubt I will be getting much sleep sitting up in a cramped seat, but I am trying out ANC headphones, pillows, etc now to see what might assist. I am of average height, so legroom isn't a huge deal. I'm not thin, but I also don't come close to overflowing  the confines of my seat. The more I can't fall asleep, the more anxious I get about falling asleep and it cascades. All the flights from Atlanta to London are overnight, which works for our itinerary, but I'm worried I will be a mess trying to function even until dinner time. The only other overnight flight I've taken was from SFO-ATL, and I slept perhaps thirty minutes. It wasn't very fun.

**Cost:**The above dovetails into price. I can find RT tix ATL-LHR for about $650 ($1300 for both of us) in lowest level economy via a third party off Skyscanner. Now, I've seen plenty of advice that says to book with the airline, but that bumps it up to $890pp. I could then upgrade off that if I care to. Premium Economy is running roughly double my original $650pp ticket. Is some more legroom worth double? Is being able to select your seat worth $110? We're hoping to travel light, just a carry on bag for us each.

I just have no frame of reference to know if the $650pp deal is good, to not buy third party, and if it's worth double to change from Economy Basic to Premium Economy (the carrier I am basing all this off of is BA, but it seems to be the same for Delta, et al). Since we've never really traveled, we have no loyalty, points, or anything other than currency to use. We hope this is the beginning of the second half of our lives traveling more, but we are starting basically from scratch. In a similar manner, I have no idea which airlines and which planes are better than others, only that a ton of people are not impressed with United.

We are planning to visit Japan next summer, and are trying to get everything booked up now. I was emailed a link from them to United Airlines for tickets with the same itinerary, however the prices they paid are *damn near half* of what it's going to cost me. 

Per person, they paid about 600 dollars, whereas the cheapest I can find is almost 1,000 dollarydoos (938 to be exact). Even when putting on ""my dates are flexible"" and leaving +/-3 days from the actual date, it's pretty much the same price. 

Does anyone have any idea why this might be the case, and if there is some way to get the tickets for the same price that they bought them at? I'm piss poor at this and feel like a fish out of water when it comes to finding a airline ticket, as the last time I flew was about 10 years ago. 

I'm going to keep checking prices for the next few weeks and see if they magically go down again, but if possible I'd really like to spend less on the tickets, so I can spend more while doing dope shit in Japan. "

My partner and I have both decided to aim for layovers of at least 2 hours to ensure that we can make our connecting flight in a decent amount of time without having to sprint across the airport. We've had several situations where the wait time between flights were under 2 hours and we were 5-10 minutes away from missing our next flights because either security took forever or our previous flight was delayed. This happened with westjet, aircanada and united airlines and we hated it so we want to avoid that if we can.

However, this great flight has a layover for 1hr and 40 minutes in Beijing and I'm wondering if anyone has been to Beijing airport and possibly even took a flight from there to tokyo and how the experience was. Was it super chaotic and did security take forever? Do you think 1hr40 mins is enough? If we miss the flight are there quite a bit of flights going back and forth? 

Also, what are your experiences with air china? The planes we would take are both air china and I would like to know if they're known for having delays or if they're usually punctual? I've never flown with air china or any planes outside of the ones mentioned earlier and they've all been delayed for me so that also plays a role in catching connecting flights!


Any other information is greatly appreciated! :)"

My bf and I will be traveling in Rome and Venice for a week. We'll be flying out from the United States and I figure we could do around 3 days in Rome and 3 days in Venice.

My question is about the logistics from traveling to Venice from Rome.

We'll be having 3 luggage bags with us (2 small carry-on and 1 large luggage bag).

Would the best way to travel from Rome to Venice (with all of our luggage) be using the Trenitailia or taking an airline for a small flight. 

Is there any other forms of transportation we can use to get to Venice from Rome?

Another question outside of logistics, anything that I should be aware of when traveling in Rome or Venice. Any good restaurant recommendations are greatly appreciated!

I'm lookin online, but I'm hoping someone with first hand experience can help. I recently took a trip and met a wonderful person there. She stayed at the same hostel and we kinda fell for each other. Her itinerary is set to go to Kentucky, but she intends to get off where I live in San Francisco. She can just get off the plane, but her checked luggage is set to go to the final destination.

Any advice for what I can do? I'm going to do more research, but I'll be monitoring this post as I know the power of the collective knowledge of reddit!

&#x200B;

\*Update\*

I called the airline and they have submitted my request, but it's pending approval. I'll go to the airport early and see if anything can be done. This was a really last minute, spontaneous, romantic thing and though we met in Hawaii, she's international and her English skills aren't great (we share a common language). I'm thankful to all of you who helped shed light on this situation.

*update 2*
I showed up at the airport early and explained the situation. The lady at the counter was very understanding and she even waived the ?shorting? fee. In reading some of the responses, I tend to agree that my actions, though unintentional, could make things harder for travelers. Sometimes we are blind to everything to our circumstances, but I?m glad we were able to take care of everything and have a happy result.

For anyone who might be curious, I was at San Francisco and it was a united airlines itinerary. I was asked for a itinerary, passenger name and baggage claim numbers. I provided that and was told that my friend would default on the rest of her flights and that there was a fee of $200. The ticket professional was typing in stuff when I asked her (very nicely and super politely) if there was anything we can do about the fee. I gave her a super quick summary of the situation and she said something like, ?that?s very sweet, don?t worry about the fee, the computer doesn?t seem to be working very well anyways?.

Again, thanks everyone for your insight and feedback. My friend and I are very grateful :)"

The info: My flight is on the 8th of july to London, Ontario, and my returning flight to the US is on the 10th. 

Basically, do I NEED a passport to fly into Canada if I'm a US citizen and can prove so? (birth certificate, social security, driver's license, receipt for new passport, etc.) My father, who traveled a good bit, said I shouldn't really need one if I'm a citizen, and googling this has also corroborated his statement. To make double sure, I called united airlines customer support and they said that since I'm a US citizen, all I need is my birth certificate and driver's license, although I may go through extra security checks. To make triple sure, me and my father went to the passport agency to go ahead and renew my passport, (a few days too late to expedite it in time it seems) and the worker said confidently that if I'm going to Canada, that I do not need a passport, just a birth certificate and driver's license.


Can someone please tell me if I will be okay or not? I really do not know what to think. I have a receipt for the passport I just ordered, would bringing that along be a good idea? 

UPDATE: Finally got a hold of Air Canada, they confirmed along with many of you that I need the passport to fly anywhere out the country. I just got off the phone with the lady who did my passport submission as a result of this. She said that the information has already been shipped out but to call her next week. She said that by that time, the passport would already have been fully processed in another location and I can expedite it to get it to me in 3-5 business days, and if they cannot do that, I can setup an appointment with the New Orleans agency and get it printed there. She said not to spend the next days worrying about this, the trip will be made. I think I'm gonna be okay."

&#x200B;

So I've read many of the rather pointed opinions on booking with a 3rd-party agency vs. booking with the airline directly. Instead of asking which is best, I'll ask- what would you do in my scenario?

I can get a round-trip flight to & from my home city in the USA (BNA) to Bangkok (with 2 stops/layovers) for $800 via Expedia, or I can book directly with one of the airlines for $1100+. I understand if there are delays, Expedia might not help me out in the best way- but an airline would take better care of me.

&#x200B;

Second, on the note of travel insurance, If I booked through Expedia, I know to buy travel insurance from an external source- would the travel insurance cover me where Expedia fails? I imagine not booking Expedia's travel insurance would make them even less likely to help me if an issue were to arise.

This being my 3rd international solo trip, I somehow never had to deal with this dilemma. I suppose the multiple legs makes me nervous. The outbound section of the trip is all through ANA (though I can't find a comprable 1-way price on said airline's site).  The return flight is through a combination of Hong Kong Air and United. Being well over 6 ft, I liked the idea of flying ANA for the extra legroom, too! I simply don't want to waste my money booking through Expedia.

Have you guys had much success booking multiple-legged international trips via Expedia?

My wife and I will be returning from our honeymoon in Vienna Oct 26th and I'm a little concerned about our short layover time in IAD when returning to the states. Before I start we both have Global Entry and are US citizens.

We have a 1 hour and 22 minute layover in IAD coming from Vienna. We're arriving on an Austrian Airlines flight (operated by United) and boarding a United flight back home domestically. From what I understand the process is as follows:

1. Get off flight in terminal B(?) and hop on mobile bus lounge thing to get to terminal C
2. Go through global entry kiosk process
3. Wait for bags and begin sweating profusely from stress
4. Grab bags and haul ass to drop off point, place bags on conveyor belt, or give to person standing there
5. Go through TSA Precheck security again
6. Sprint like Usain Bolt to our flight on United which is hopefully located in terminal C as well, if not D.

Is 1hr22m going to be enough for all this? Did i get the process wrong at all? I'm pretty sure our global entry should cut out 90% of the potential set back but the next flight out isnt until after 10pm and I'd rather not do a red eye with work the next morning.

In a nutshell 30 hours stuck in airports and airplanes instead of 15 hours. My flight from from Phx to Chicago via United Air was delayed twice, meaning I would have missed my connection to Dublin. This was due to mechanical difficulties with the airplane. 

United put me on a 10 hour flight to London via British Airways. I paid $1,100 to upgrade to business class because I refuse to fly more then  8 hours straight and this was the only way I could get to my family in Ireland without losing my mind. 

Flight to London was great! Then my connection to Dublin via Aer Lingus was delayed twice, 4 hours because the traffic control tower was having problems. Finally got on my flight and landed in Ireland 12 hours late. 

Went to grab my luggage and one piece was ?lost?. I made a claim and told them I have medication in my bag. Fam, I don?t normally check meds but I?m here for 2 months and it was a last minute decision to check my carry on. My bad. 

Fast forward to today. I call to check my bags status and it had conveniently arrived in Dublin about 45 minutes before I called. I told them about the medication and the guy said ?well it?s not listed on your original claim?. I told him I told the agent the night before and then he said he?d put a rush on delivering it to my cousins address. Yes, I?m in Ireland for 2 months. But only at my cousins outside of Dublin for a few days. 

THEN!!! I checked online and the status basically said ?tracking continues, please check later?, so I called again. That time, the woman I spoke w said the London flight it was supposed to be on was canceled and because of the medication she will put an urgent delivery on it. 

Aer Lingus is completely lying to me. Out of pocket I have spent close to $3,000 USD on a $1,500 flight (had to go shopping today to replace some items) and now I?m missing luggage that has clothes, toiletries and meds that I will basically be in the hospital if I don?t have. Thankfully being a bit of a gypsy I always have 4 day back up in my purse. It is officially 25 hours since I landed in Dublin. Still no luggage or a clue as to if I?ll ever see it again 

HOW DO I MAKE THE MOST OUT OF RECEIVING COMPENSATION???? 

If anyone can help me battle the corporate airlines, PLEASE FILL ME IN!!! I have no clue when or if I?ll see my suitcase again. I want full compensation for all of this.

Good morning guys. I wanted to write my frustration with American Airlines. I live down in Miami, but I always drive up to Fort Lauderdale to fly with Southwest. this time,  I, along with my family, flew out of Miami to Chicago. Although I had to pay for bag fees, and dumb seat fees in order for us to sit together, the flight from Miami to Chicago was great.

?On our way back to Miami, we had a connecting flight at Charlotte. First, I paid again the crazy seat fees and bag fee, our flight from Chicago got delayed and lost the connecting flight. Then, they switches us to a flight that was going to Fort Lauderdale. That flight was getting delayed every 30 minutes since 9 p.m. They cancelled it at midnight with the same bad weather excuse, and told us to go to customer service to change it. They delayed and cancelled a bunch of flights that night with the same bad weather excuse. What i found weird was that on the airport screen, I had noticed that Delta, United, and Southwest flights were on time. Only American flights were getting delayed and gate changed every now and then. In conclusion guys, I had to call work to tell them that I couldn't make it to work the next day, buy food, and sleep at the airport with my family. There were pregnant women, little kids, very old people, and American Airlines didn't even give food or place to sleep. I just wanted to share my experience, as I might not fly with them again."

I just bought a ticket on United yesterday for around 890 USD for flying into Tokyo from SFO and then flying out of Bangkok into SFO. I bought it last night so I still have time to cancel, etc. He says he will know by Monday, but that leaves me with taking the gamble of leaving the ticket and seeing if he can get me the free ticket, or saying with my ticket. Monday is only 2 days away, so I figured if I do cancel tonight I can still wait until Monday and worst comes to worst - I can just buy a ticket back on United hoping its close to the same price or on Orbitz. I would still guy a ticket going there, as my friend would probably just get me ticket flying back into SFO. 

I picked United right now because I always fly with them, so I was comfortable picking them. But if I cancel with ticket, wait until Monday and then my friend find out he can't get the ticket, I was thinking about just buying on Orbitz like I said, as I see they are going for about 650 USD, which is a really good price. What are the chances I will actually obtain a free ticket? I know its impossible for you guy to know - but do airlines do this?

We'll be flying out of Chicago to Manchester, England; returning from Stockholm to Chicago.  Our best priced options are:

- super cheap economy on United/Air Canada for just under $700 per person (2 stops on return flight)
- Icelandair for about $1100 per person (2 stops on return flight)
- SAS for about $900 per person (1 stop each way, reasonable layovers)
- Virgin Atlantic/Air France for about $800 per person (7 hour layover on return flight)


We do have some flexibility.  We can go to Sweden first and then England but we want to be in Sweden over the solstice since there's a big family event that we want to attend.  Going to Sweden first and would push our travel plans into July and prices seem to go up in July.

"2014-12-31 18:51:13"|"Muslims Eat Rice and Curry"|"I recently flew a united flight from LAX to DXB. The IAD to DXB leg was quite long so I decided to shell out and upgrade to BusinessFirst. That is where the nightmare begins.

After writing the following letter to Jeff Smisek, the CEO of united airlines, I received a phone call back. United thanked me for writing the letter, this of course after I was informed that the Lady I was talking to had been in the business for longer then I have been flying.

Here is the letter for your reading pleasure.

Dear Mr. Hand & Mr. Smisek, 

I recently flew on United Airlines from LAX to DXB to YYZ.  Along the duration of my flight?s there were a number of circumstances which led to this being the most awful travel experience of my flight career, which as a consultant I am in the air 48 weeks a year on business and another 2 weeks a year visiting family.

On my way from LAX to DXB, the flight attendant behaved in a very racist manner towards me, she served me my meal last and responded to any inquiries I had very rudely.  My request for a Halal meal lead to public scorn and embarrassment as your flight attendant very rudely informed me that the Halal meal needed to be ordered 2 hours prior to serving. I did in fact request the specific meal when upgrading my seat prior to departing LAX there seems to be a sort of disconnect within your company. Needless to say the mistreatment from the flight crew negatively impacted my travel experience. As a business first passenger there is a standard of treatment which I expect to be treated in.

But United, you guys never fail to disappoint. The return trip, has to be by far the worst experience I have had in life period. As is I am a 27 year old Muslim Male with a beard. So I am sure you could picture the already prejudice looks I get from, TSA, Airline Employees and fellow passengers. But nothing can top the actions of Ms. Lotta Von ?Something? (I couldn't get her last name because when I tried she took her name tag off.)

Ms. Lotta Von X let?s call her, approached  me upon reaching 10,000 feet, Mr.Chagleelee was my name on this flight (I thought literacy was a requirement but OK). I said yes, she said we have the Muslim meal for you.  I said, thank you, but aren't all the meals out of DXB halal? And that is when all hell broke loose.
I was screamed at and publicly humiliated, and I was told that I was not allowed to have any of the meals on the menu because I ordered the Muslim meal.
After being shouted at I asked what was in the Muslim Meal anyway, the response was priceless ?rice and curry or whatever you Muslims eat.? At that point I had enough, I began speaking to another Air Host and his apology was truly one of a kind. ?Yeah, its ok she can come off like that?. As if expecting me to be patient and understanding with her. Then Ms. Lotta now comes back and refills my sprite with water, which then took her the duration of the flight to rectify because I never got another one from her. As a matter of fact, I had to get up and go the galley to get a drink.

The best part of all of this is that I was sitting next to a Senior Vice President of (Sorry I have to edit this out), who looked at me and said, ?I am shocked, I have never seen anything like this.?

The final flight from Dulles to Toronto, there was no Premier access on boarding, no first class or Economy plus, and once again the Gate agent was extremely rude as well as oblivious and unable to effectively respond to my inquiries regarding the flight details. (Please do explain why I am paying an arm and a leg for this?)

My total flight time was around 30 hours which I would consider fairly long, as such I chose to upgrade in order to receive more comfortable seating as well as more personal service. Yes the seating was adequate however the horrific service provided lead me to reconsider my decision of choosing United Airlines entirely. I am an avid flyer and this is the first time I have experienced such poor behavior from crew members and the remainder of the airlines personnel?s.  It seems throughout my multiple flight?s there seems to be some common animosity from the crew members toward the Halal/Muslim meal displaying racist behavior. Would this be ordinary behavior to be expected by United Airlines, if so United Airlines will most definitely not be a part of my future travels plans. The saddest part of all this, this is the first United flight since accepting the premier match challenge. I think I will stay with Delta. In all the flights I have ever taken with them or any other airline for that matter, I have never been as appalled as to write a letter of complaint. I would like to thank you guys for giving me this opportunity to experience a new first.

I'm from Canada and I've never had this issue with a domestic flight; the only times this has happened is on international flights.  I've been denied a mobile pass a few times on flights from Canada to the US, but I've often got them on the return flight.  Last year I went to Europe for the first time in a while.  I couldn't get a mobile pass for my flight overseas (the first leg was with Air Canada and the second leg was with SAS and I couldn't get a mobile pass for either flight).  I went on two trips by plane when I was overseas, one was two legs each way (with SAS) and one was one leg each way (with Norwegian).  Both times I got a mobile pass for all flights.  On my return trip home, I had a four leg trip: three legs with SAS and the last one with United.  I couldn't get a mobile pass for any of the SAS flights but I got one for the United flight.  This year, I traveled to the US on WestJet and I was able to get a mobile pass for both legs of the trip, including the trip to the US, which confused me a little.  What's the reasoning for this?  I'm going to travel overseas again this summer and I was wondering what the criteria are for getting a mobile boarding pass and if the policies vary from airline to airline.  I know people who have had mobile passes for international flights before and I prefer them over paper tickets as it's one less item to remember to hold on to (I forgot my paper ticket on a flight last year because I was in a hurry and I'm so used to mobile passes).  Can anyone try to explain why sometimes I'm ineligible for a mobile pass?"

"2018-09-20 01:40:04"|"Need advice for changed itinerary by United (17 hours of layover added)"|"Hi all,

**tl;dr** United rebooked my confirmed award flight and added >17 hours of layover where they were very decent layovers before. They say they can't do anything but refund me or let me live with it even though I booked months ago. Any help?

If there's a better place to post this please let me know.

I recently booked a Awards flight with United after saving >400k miles over the past few years. It was a round trip flight to Sydney from Europe for 2 adults flying First Class one way and Business back (they were the First Class Saver the Business Saver awards). I found the dates at a great time, leaving just after Christmas, getting in Sydney for New Years, and coming back a few weeks later.

I logged into my United account today and saw ""Your itinerary has changed"" and assumed there's a slightly later take off time. I didn't get an email that I can find about this.

Original Flight: Total time ~24 hours
* Europe -> FRA; 1.5 hour layover
* FRA -> BKK; 1 hour layover
* BKK -> SYD

was changed to: Total time ~34 hours
* Europe -> FRA; 1.5 hour layover
* FRA -> BKK; 11.5 hour layover
* BKK -> SYD

So ~10.5 hours of layover were added. I checked the flight back, and the SYD -> BKK moved from afternoon to morning and they added another big layover.

Original:
* SYD -> BKK; 3.5 hour layover
* BKK -> VIE; 1.5 hour layover
* VIE -> Europe

New:
* SYD -> BKK; 10 hour layover
* BKK -> VIE; 1.5 hour layover
* VIE -> Europe

So ~6.5 hours of layover were added.

So I understand these things happen, but when I called them they told me that they can't find any flights at all on the way to SYD that would avoid the layover and they offered to fly me around the other side of the world for the way back saving me like 3 hours total. Keep in mind, I found >5 flights that were also Star Alliance (original flights were mostly Thai Airlines) and I found them through the United online search. Those flights stopped in a few different layover spots that would get me to SYD in a reasonable amount of time. 

Does anyone know how to approach this? Do I have any leverage here? We saved miles up forever and booked this flight at really decent times (even with the double layover) and they arbitrarily re-booked it to cost us almost a day of vacation (including bumping up my return flight from afternoon to morning).

They keep saying that there are no business saver awards flights available to switch to, but I booked a ticket, the original flight may have disappeared (I think the partner airline discontinued the flight) but I had a really decent booking and I'm pretty annoyed with the insane addition of time. I'd be expecting them to find me a Business Everyday Award or whatever, or be somewhat accommodating but it's mostly just apologizing and telling me their hands are tied.

I've pointed out all the alternative flights I found and they keep telling me ""they don't have the award tickets available in the system"".

The most they've offered is to refund the points and taxes, which is fine I guess, but I've had a whole vacation planned since June.

Has anyone been in this situation and had a positive outcome? I know the award points always have a bunch of stipulations, but I had a confirmed ticket, this just feels like a scam."

I agree about the service 100%. But the price thing? Nope. Since I just bought a ticket today I thought I'd share the difference in price.

AMS-EWR, 4-10 May.

As usual, Momondo found the cheapest price: http://imgur.com/j8VLIWO - UA 71/70 nonstop for ?371 via budgetair.nl, which I've used several times before with good results - http://imgur.com/kuIPi9T 

I bought this ticket and it's confirmed with a ticket number verified on united.com.

Skyscanner found the same flight as a Lufthansa codeshare for ?412 with a different discounter, but didn't find the ?371 one. - http://imgur.com/1b14kgG

Hipmunk, which basically just gives you the same crap as Expedia/Travelocity, offers it for ?748 - http://imgur.com/ZzYA727

And guess what? That's the same price that United themselves is selling it for in this market - http://imgur.com/vmDfLW0

And if you tell United you're in the USA, they want $812 for it, which is a ?4 savings - http://imgur.com/UmkLAo9

tl;dr: the ticket was exactly half the price through a discounter, which is consistent with my experience in the past. It is definitely worth checking out these other agencies if the price tag matters."

"2017-04-30 20:24:46"|"I just flew Spirit airlines and it was the best flight of my life. Highly recommend."|"I booked a 2 way flight out of DC to Tampa for me and my family. The flight there was with United, and back was with Spirit. Ive never flown Spirit, but have heard the bad stories. So I was very cautious and mentally prepared myself for some BS on the way back. Boy was I wrong.

Price- Short and simple, its ridiculously cheap. For 3 people I paid $180 for the flight back (thats with seat reservations)

""Extra Fees""- Spirit makes it very easy and simple and telling you what will cost extra. They send emails, notifications, and go over it on the website. In order to get ""surprised"" with anything, you literally have to ignore the dozen times they shove in your face the things that will cost more.

Luggage fees- They let you bring one personal item for free. My wife had a big bag, and I had a bookbag. Both of these were free. If we had a large suitcase we could have checked it in for $40 I believe, but we did not. We also had a stroller which was free as well.

Customer Service- Both the people at the gate and attendants where polite, clean, well dressed, and helpful. No problems there.

Plane Comfort/Appearance/Cleanliness- This was the biggest surprise for me. The plane I flew on with Spirit was amazing. Due to having no fat reclining seats (as if that extra 2 inch tilt of the seat makes a difference) there was so much room! Im talking the isle was wider, the leg room was more, it felt so ""open"" compared to anything I've flown before. The cabin was clean, well lit, and there was a lot of open seats so you could move around without any issues. Ive flown United both with Wifi entertainment, TV's in the seats, American Airlines, etc, and this was honestly the most comfortable plane simply because it was so roomie and open. It felts like the cabin was a lot bigger than other planes.

Refreshments- Yes, they are not free. And maybe if you are flying 6-8 hours that could be an issue. But our flight was 2 hours, and we had snacks and a drink we purchased at the airport with us so that was no issue. They came around with a large variety of food and drinks and I got myself some hard lemonade which was great.

Overall I would highly recommend flying Spirit. Ive heard a story where are girl had to pay for luggage, and the flight ended up having a layover and she had to pay again at the layover. That seems ridiculous and maybe someone screwed up. Other than that I have not heard any valid points as to why they are a ""bad"" airline because of their extra fees, since they go over it very clearly.

Anyway, just thought I would let you guys know. Enjoy!"

I was researching flights and a one way flight home would cost $3,500, but I could buy a round trip flight for the same day for $232 and the return flight would be about $239, so overall it would be a lot less than buying a one way. My question is, how would the airline feel about me not taking that return flight? Could I pay an extra $100 for a flexible ticket and then cancel the return flight? Any advice about this would be helpful.

Also, I know I could buy through another airline, but I would prefer to fly United. However, I will be using another airline if this is not possible.

"2017-09-03 17:57:31"|"Two cancelled United flights in one night - does anyone know what compensation we would be entitled to/could demand?"|"tl/dr  
First 10pm flight from Newark to London Heathrow was cancelled due to a fault, as was the second 6 hours later.  Finally got to a hotel at about 9:15.  Finally got a flight out from JFK with a different airline nearly 24 hours after the first was due to leave.   

Long story:   

* 10:30pm United Flight departed gate on time: 10.30pm.   
* Taxied onto runway and sat still. Approximately 11pm, told technical fault. Towed back to gate to investigate.   
* Problem not able to be fixed. Told another aircraft would be available shortly. Disembarked approx. 11.30pm.   
* Gate information suggested departure at 12.30am. Subsequently moved to 1.30am, 2.30am and 3am. * Occasional updates suggesting food transfer to new flight was a problem due to ?configuration? of aircraft.   
* Given $15 of food vouchers on boarding card, however, no food outlets open. Used on chips, chocolate, bottled drinks as this was only option.   
* Boarded second flight at approx.. 3am. On runway at 3.30pm. Told we were being moved from gate to meet departure slot but paperwork was being completed.  
  
* Shortly after told another technical fault with fuel pump. Towed back to gate to check problem. Could not be resolved. Ground staff informed us there would be a flight put on at 6pm for passengers affected.   
* Disembarked at approx.. 4am and ushered to customer service desk. ONE staff member available for quite some time until several customers complained.      
* Waited for 2 hours to be allocated a hotel and onward flight (and we were quite near the front of the line)? Virgin from JFK at 6.45pm ? NOT United flight promised. No additional refreshments offered. Nobody knew what was happening.   
* Given flight, hotel room until 1pm, $30 each of food vouchers, voucher for taxi to JFK.   
* Told to collect baggage as needed to be taken with us due to airport change.   
* Took baggage vouchers to reclaim at 6.15am. Told could wait up to an hour as baggage had to be located.   
* Enquired several times and told ?it?s a long process?. At approx.. 8am, all baggage from flight was unloaded after insistence of speaking to a manager and being told ?it wouldn?t make any difference? and refused.   
* Bags collected approx. 8.30am.   
* Shuttle taken to hotel and checked in approx.. 9.15am.   
* Had 3 hours of sleep. Checked out due to need to travel to JFK. Used $30 of vouchers at hotel to buy food.
* Shuttle back to airport and then found cab to JFK.   
* Arrived at JFK at approx.. 3.30pm and checked into Virgin flight.   
* Tried to used remainder of food vouchers but told only valid at Newark by customer services.  Therefore purchased own food and drink.   
* Virgin flight left early and arrived early.   
* Arrived back in UK approx. 20 hours late.   
   
The whole incident was a complete shambles - very little communication, and what little we had seemed dubious.  The customer service agents left to deal with the mess after the flight crew departed were not filled in on the situation and the extra 6pm flight promised by the ground crew did not exist.   
   
What I'm looking for is some kind of idea what compensation we would be entitled to or could reasonably demand.  If this were an EU airline, or a flight within the EU we would be entitled to several hundred GBP in compensation and a refund on our tickets, but I can't find any laws implying that is the case for US airlines.  I'm thinking the bare minimum we should be entitled to is a full refund on the flight plus our out of pocket expenses.

While in line for handing over my luggage at the desk I went through the usual check for Passport, when the United Airlines employee pulled me aside while holding my passport and tickets and began questioning me in a way similar to border security. The interrogation started with the usual ""where are you from"" and ""what is your business in the US"". He couldn't believe that I was visiting Chicago for university matters (although I shown him my university badge and emails confirming the story when he asked for proves), and continued with whom I was living in my house or whom I was seeing, to what and where I had for breakfast that morning and asking to describe in detail all interactions I had during the day until that moment. The little scene went on for a while to the amusement of the rest of the people in line (I went close to actually miss the desk opening time), until what I reckon was his supervisor stepped in and ""released"" me and gave back passport and ticket. The  first guy put a sticker on the passport and prompted that I was going to be questioned again and that he was ""keeping an eye"" on me (verbatim). The whole interaction looked to me plain harassment, but I did everything I could to comply and prove that I was not hiding anything. Now... What happened to me? is this normal administration for flights to the US, where Airline employees are entrusted with border security duties, or I just met a power hungry asshole that went over his prerogatives?

"2015-03-04 08:46:59"|"United change fees sure make zero sense when changing to a cheaper flight."|"I'll try to be brief, since I'm sure you all see this type of thing a lot.  But I'm bad at that.

Bought two one-way tickets on United via credit card points.  Cost of each ticket was $234 at the time.  Got the wrong dates from my travel partner.  Ugh.

Chase can reschedule for a $200 charge per ticket.  United would charge me $250 per ticket to cancel.  Neither option makes any sense, since my replacement flight is only $132.  I talked to multiple CSRs and supervisors, hoping for an exception due to the pricing difference.  I was willing to pay $234 for a $132 flight and call it even.  While they agreed with my logic and thought this particular situation was silly, they all chose to stick to the policy.

It gets more interesting.  My original flight is nearly sold out.  Ticket price has increased from the $234 I paid to $615 currently.  If only passengers could resell their tickets!

If United had accepted my offer, which was an even no-fee swap, I would effectively be paying about $100 extra per ticket for the new flight, and I'd be opening up two seats that could each net them $615 instead of the $234 I paid.

Putting it another way, I have now paid a total of $732 for 4 flights (plus one bag), two of which I'm not going to use.  My seats will fly empty, unless they've overbooked.  They could have accepted $468 from me, plus $1230 (plus additional bags, etc.) from other passengers for the same 4 tickets.

I get the change policies and associated fees.  They have to plan their routes and pricing and they don't want you to cancel at the last minute.  They want to make money.  That's fine.  I made a mistake.  That's fine.  But in this particular case, they've given up at least $1,000 in additional fares by sticking to the policy.  If I want to switch to a different flight on *your* airline, and my new flight costs less than the old flight *and* less than the change fee, then why would anyone pay the change fee?  And if the fare difference alone in your favor is nearly twice the cost of the change fee...*change my flight for free and sell my tickets to someone else.*  This is basic math, people.

I'm sorry.  I've been ranting about this for weeks now.  I was just reminded when I got an email today to ""check out the available seat upgrades"" for my original flight (for which economy seats are sold out).  So, I apologize for making you read through it all.

tl;dr:  I booked the wrong flights.  When I tried to fix it, United turned down $1230 in favor of demanding $400 in fees; but in the end, they'll only get $264.  My mistake cost me $468, but their mistake cost them $966, plus some respect from customers who can math."

The situation: I work in London, but have been invited to interview for a couple of PhD positions in California. The interviews are a couple of weeks apart, so I can?t batch them into one trip (and I?m not allowed to take more than four consecutive days off from work anyway). As a result, I?ll be making two rapid-fire trips from London to California and back (2.5 days on the ground for the first, 1.5 days for the second). I?ve never flown so far before, so I?m quite nervous.

Complications: I need to be performing as highly as possible for the interviews of course, and fully functioning at work the morning after I get back from each trip. (Otherwise it counts as taking additional unapproved holiday time.) These two trips take up all of my accrued holiday, and my company can?t know about these interviews, so I?m not able to extend either trip. The universities will only pay for the basic economy fare, and I?m just not able to cover the increase in fare for premium economy myself (+?1100/$1500 for the first trip alone), so I?m stuck in coach. I?m worried about space as I am fairly tall (5?11?). The economy luggage allowance is only 8kg. Oh, and I?ve never been able to sleep on planes, not even with heavy-grade sleeping medication. 

(I?m not entirely sure who my first flight is with. I booked it through Austrian, after booking they said it was actually operated by United, and it has a Lufthansa flight number. I plan to call Austrian this weekend to see if I can confirm the underlying airline and get their booking code, and then see if I can upgrade to an exit seat or something.)

So my question is... is this manageable? Or am I a wee bit screwed? 

Specifically:

1. How do I manage such long and densely distributed flights?
2. Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of being alert at the interviews and at work after?
3. Any advice on keeping my luggage under the 8kg? I plan to wear my interview shoes on the plane. 
4. Has anyone else balanced international interviews with a high-pressure job? How did it go?

Thank you!!

Update: I contacted a couple of airlines and was able to get the confirmation code from the cancelation. It was with United, and I was missing the last character from the code. Thanks for the advice, fellow travelers!"

All of the travelling I have done in my life has been via car.

This summer I will be going to Oahu for my honeymoon and am nervous about booking flights and I am intimidated by the airports.

My questions are as follows:

Is it reliable to book flight + hotel through expedia? Never used them before. Do they send you the airline tickets and hotel confirmation?

How do ""stop"" flights work? One flight I was looking at goes from Oahu to San Francisco and then a 32 minute gap until the flight takes off again. Would I have to get off the one plane and all my stuff and go to another plane or is it usually the same plane? How would I work if I had a checked bag? Would the airline (United) transfer all the luggage or would that be my responsibility? 

I would be flying out of Newark airport and have never been there before. Is it confusing and hard to navigate? If I had a 7:00 am flight, what time would be best to get there?"
"2017-11-27 21:40:56"|"Which airline best to accrue miles on?"|"I started traveling a lot for work over the past 1.5-2 years. Usually 2-4 larger trips each year and a monthly shorter trip. The dates and times I fly in and out need to be flexible as it can change on the fly (pun intended) based on meeting schedules. The most convenient flights are usually with United, Delta, or Virgin. I already have about 25K miles with United and haven?t honestly been tracking the others (maybe 4-6 short trips with Delta in the past few months). Which airline should I stick with going forward to accrue miles? My brother suggested United - he?s close to a million miles with them, and his wife is the same with Virgin which is definitely nicer but has downsides (less flights and less flight flexibility). I?m looking for what would have the best perks but also what has the most frequent and cheap flights both domestically (US) and internationally. I?m leaning towards United but it has lower reviews.

She went to the American desk at 9:15 (flight was at 11:00) and they directed her to an American customer service number, who then told her to contact United customer service because they were in charge of reissuing, and then that rep told her to go to the United ticket desk at the airport.  She went through all this and they United agent was unable to figure out what to do or what was going on and she ended up missing her flight.  They have the rule where you have to check in 45 minutes before your flight.  

They didn't give her a refund and were unable to find an alternative flight with open seats.  So now she's spent $700 on another flight with pretty much just a ""sorry"" from United.

"2018-12-20 16:47:03"|"Best Way to get Reimbursed for Airline Maintenance Delays"|"
TL;DR best way to get compensation for delayed-for-maintenance flights on 3 separate airlines.

Long Story:

Not to say that someone else hasn?t had worse luck and worse flight delays, but my most recent trip was chalk full of delays on different airlines and while I?m totally fine now that I?m home, I?m still annoyed. I?m looking for advice on the best way to get reimbursement from each airline. Currently, I am planning on just going through each airline?s customer service phone line, but if there?s any other recommendations for what I should do, I?d love to hear them.

All of this flying is in the US

Flight 1: just me affected, delta airlines, got on flight, engine wouldn?t start, deplaned after an hour, flight delayed a total of 3ish hours, normal connecting flight would have been missed so they rebooked me to a different airport where I eventually made it to my destination 5 hours after us should have, 5 hours of work missed, somewhat important meeting missed.

Flight 2: my in-laws flight was delayed/cancelled(not sure) due to maintenance, American Airlines, AA rebooked them on a later flight causing them to miss a paint and sip class that I paid for, in-laws have no interest in paying me back but (if it?s easy enough) they?ll go through the reimbursement process for the paint class and give me the reimbursement, I know it?s only $60 but I?d rather not eat that

Flight 3: return trip home for me and wife, United Airlines, flight delayed due to maintenance (incoming flight landed but there was an issue so they lazily (yes I?m most upset about this flight) went and grabbed another plane from the hangar), flight was delayed about 1hr and 15min which essentially ate up all of our layover time at the next airport and we ran about a mile (not exaggerating) through the airport and made it to our connecting flight literally as the gate agent was walking away to shut the door, the whole plane waited just for us which was really nice but if we would have been 30 seconds later the doors would have been closed. Yes we made this connecting flight but I?m pissed about me and my wife having to run through the airport to barely make the flight

So 3 different airlines, 3 different situations, what?s my best options here? Thanks in advance for the suggestions.

Side note on Flight 1: Delta overbooked the flight by 2 people and offered 2 $800 dollar Amazon gift cards for people to take a later flight, guess who wasn?t smart enough to take that offer? Me and 100 other people :("

"2014-10-16 06:08:05"|"Terrible Situation and I cannot get a Refund from United Airlines, Reddit Please Help!"|"I've had a terrible couple of months, while having some great moments of joy as well.  I lost my dad suddenly to a heart attack at the end of July at the age of 63 (we were supposed to go to EAA Airventure the weekend following his death), and then at the very end of August, my wife who was pregnant with twins (due in December), gave birth to our first two children (over 3 months prematurely).  Faye, our firstborn daughter arrived just before midnight on August 31st and lived only 17 hours, while Brian, born just after midnight on September 1st (yes Labor Day), has been hanging in there, living in a NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit - at the hospital).  Being so premature requires a lot of medical help!  We expect him to be in the hospital until late this year or early next year.  How does this relate to travel?  As the title says, I simply cannot get United Airlines to budge on their no refund policy (on non-refundable tickets).  We had two trips planned, one wedding in Washington (flight was to Portland, OR) and one extended family trip to Florida, that our doctor recommended we not go on since of the higher risk with carrying twins.  I have been trying since my wife and I learned we had twins on the way to get my United Airlines tickets refunded (well over a month before either trip), and still cannot get a refund...

A couple of things worth noting about my experiences during this time with other travel companies:

1. I used Hotwire to book a couple hotel nights in Wisconsin for the Airventure trip.  I called them and told them the situation of my dad passing and they refunded me immediately.  This is certainly an exception to their normal policy of no refunds.
THANK YOU HOTWIRE!

2. I had purchased a Travelzoo voucher for a hotel night and museum visit in Springfield, IL (relatively near where we live).  I was planning this for our 5th wedding anniversary and when I told Travelzoo our situation with a baby in the hospital and one passing, they refunded me immediately after talking with a supervisor.  This again is certainly an exception to another company's normal policy of no refunds.
THANK YOU TRAVELZOO!

The following was submitted to http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/Contact/customer/default.aspx on September 26th, 2014:

To whom it may concern in United Airlines Customer Care,

I have been trying to work with United Airlines to get my tickets refunded for some time now (months).  I have used the United website multiple times (cancelling the tickets and submitting refund requests), submitting and resubmitting requests, and called probably more than half a dozen times (I tried just now and gave up as it would be 20-25 minutes of waiting) with very little to no progress.  Originally, I was requesting a refund as my wife was pregnant with twins, which was not an appropriate reason for a refund I was told.  We provided a signed doctor's note telling us not to fly and requested all the flights listed below be refunded.  I was told we could rebook our flights for next year, once the twins had been born.  This was my only option at that time.

Our situation has changed again.  Our twins that were due in December, were born August 31st/Sept 1st.  Our daughter, Faye, passed away just 17 hours into life, and our son, Brian has been struggling through life and is doing relatively well considering his prematurity.  Assuming Brian continues to do well, we will very likely be in the hospital until January 2015 or later.  I again ask that United refund me the full amount of my tickets and not give me the round-about and require me to rebook a different flight early next year.  We will very likely be unable to travel with Brian for a while (depending on his medical needs).  I just ask that United Airlines please treat me and my family as people, and try to understand my situation in the slightest.

Here are the refund request numbers and ticket numbers in full:
M24G06 -> Oregon - $696 (2 tickets)
Ticket 1 (Carl) - Ticket #
Ticket 2 (Lauren) - Ticket #
PGDMST -> Florida - $602 (2 tickets)

Please help Reddit!  I don't think it's unreasonable to be refunded in such a circumstance (as shown by Hotwire and Travelzoo), but apparently United Airlines feels it more important to strictly adhere to a policy than to treat their customers as people.

Update: United refunded all but 50 dollars from all 4 flights (200 dollars total)!  I am relatively satisfied, but I do find it a bit unusual that they didn't just do the whole amount.  I'm done dealing with them though.  Thank you for all your tips and encouragement!  Never give up!"

"2014-12-01 16:56:20"|"0-2 with United Airlines and why I will never travel with them again"|"So to start my rant lets go back to September of 2013. a friend and I had been working in San Diego and one of our best friends was getting married and we were both groomsmen, we booked our flight through United from San Diego  airport to portland with a layover in San Francisco, our flight was delayed leaving San Diego, when we got to San Francisco we had enough time and got to the gate ten minutes before takeoff. Unfortunately as we got there we had the opportunity to watch our flight take off early. So after waiting in line for several hours we were able to get our next flight with an arrival time around 9 am something like 16 hours later than our original arrival time... Just in time to be an hour late to the rehearsal going on a couple hours of sleep, 0 compensation and nobody can do anything better for us. I guess just shit luck. 

Fast forward to November of 2014, me and my fianc? going to Italy via United. Wonderful vacation we had an amazing time, $1400 usd a person just for airline tickets, worth every penny until our flight home.... So we get to the Florence airport a little late but easily make our flight, a little stressful but we're happy, we land for our layover in Germany and we both get the random screening in the back along with 2 dozen or so other people from the same flight, not even half the people have gone in the back and our flight is supposed to be boarding, the plane is held for us and we leave for our next lay over in San Francisco a little late it's about a 15-16 hour flight and they were able to make up lost time and get us there on time, and wouldn't you know it we get to our gate and then our flight to Portland is cancelled.... We again stand in line for 3 hours to talk to customer service again they claim they can't do anything for us(also are extremely rude and don't answer our questions)try getting us on flights but we can't get anything, we were but on standby an only third in line, that seems like a decent chance of getting something? Nope, because for some reason an hour later we are bumped to 14th, wtf? Go back to stand in line for an hour oh we aren't gold members or some bullshit so others have priority. We have now been in San Francisco airport for 16 hours and the best they can get us is a flight with yet another layover in Seattle with our final arrival time in Portland at 4 pm, 21 hours later than our original arrival time... Again not offering us any compensation we had to buy 40 dollars worth of shitty airport food for dinner and breakfast I end up missing out on a day and a half of work. She goes to school at WSU and this caused her to miss her train which was a $40 ticket, she also missed two nights of work, and two days of classes, and WSU is not very cheap for us. 

TLDR: United airlines turned a 6 hour trip into 22 hour trip and a 21 hour trip into a 44 hour trip with 0 compensation

"2014-04-03 02:00:52"|"United Airlines wants to charge me $200 to relinquish a seat."|"Back in January I booked a round trip flight on United Airlines from Seattle to Greensboro, NC for a friend's wedding which is happening April 12th. I decided to fly on the 10th and take a couple days of vacation.

This week I find out I need to fly to NYC for work, which will directly lead up to my planned vacation. No problem says my boss, why don't you fly directly to North Carolina from New York and then hop on your original flight home. Sounds great to me, I can avoid flying back and forth across the country needlessly.

I call United Airlines to let them know I won't be needing the outgoing leg of the flight. I understand it's a non-refundable ticket so I don't expect any money back, but I thought it was the right thing to do, plus *maybe* I thought I would get some credit for a future flight.

The reservation agent informs me that they will charge me $200 to ""change my ticket."" I'm confused, I tell her, I need to pay you to give back the seat? ""Yes"" she says, there are ""operational costs"" that United incurs to resell the seat.

Ok, I say, that doesn't seem logical, but if that's the case, wouldn't it be in my best interest to simply *not* show up for the flight? This is when she informs me that if I do that, I will be marked as ""no-show"" and it will void my return ticket. Asked to talk to a supervisor, she said the same thing.

What the hell United? You're telling me it's going to cost me MORE money to take one flight instead of two?

I get that this is probably all in the fine print of my ticket agreement, but it just seems really mean spirited.

"2015-09-09 22:24:26"|"Am I the only one here that has never had a problem with United?"|"Type ""United"" into the search bar and the only thing you'll find are posts complaining about bad experiences with them, one going as far as calling them ""Comcast of the Sky"". This comes as a surprise to me seeing as I fly with them several times a year and have always had pleasant experiences. (Well, not pleasant, but no worse than any other US Airline.) 

My home airport is Dayton so going pretty much anywhere requires a connection in Chicago; a major airport for all three big airlines. (United and American in particular.) The two places I go every year are Gunnison/Crested Butte (via Denver) in the winter and Los Angeles in the spring, in addition to other places I may go once every few years. Going to Colorado is always on United and is almost always a breeze. The only time I ever had a problem was when my ORD-DEN flight was delayed by mechanical trouble and I ended up missing my connecting flight. However, upon my arrival in Denver we were met at the gate by a United representative who informed us that we had already been re-booked on the next flight and presented us with a voucher for a free night at a hotel near the airport as well as a $10 meal ticket for each of us.

 Going to Los Angeles in the spring usually involves flying either AA or Delta. Delta has been fine for the most part but flying on American more often than not becomes a complete pain in the ass. I don't think I've ever been on a AA flight out of O'Hare that wasn't delayed and their customer service completely sucks too. On my most recent trip, I flew from Burbank-Phoenix-Chicago-Dayton. In Phoenix, our flight was delayed an hour and-a-half. (Through no fault of AA, apparently someone threw up on the last flight and they had to vacuum the carpets or something.)   By the time we finally boarded, it became clear we were going to miss our flight to Dayton and would have to spend the night in Chicago. Upon landing, I expected a similar procedure as with United in Denver but coming out of the jet-bridge there was no one to be seen. Not even at the gate desk. We had to find our way to a re-booking kiosk and the seemingly thoroughly uninterested rep. on the other side took 30 minutes to get us onto the flight the next day and was ready to hang up before I asked about overnight accommodations. She curtly informed us that she couldn't do anything and we would have to go find a Customer Service staff member inside the airport. It was late at night, so there was no one at the dedicated customer service and most of the gates were empty too. We finally found two gate agents who were stuck there because the flight that was coming into their gate was delayed. (surprise!) We marched up and pretty much demanded that we be put up in a hotel and the agent, who to her credit was very polite and professional, said that she would need to phone her supervisor to approve. He pretty much just said ""yeah whatever, just give it to them"" and we were finally on our way to the hotel. (Whose bus took 45 minutes to pick us up.) 

During the ride, I thought back to people we had met at the re-booking kiosk who had also missed their Dayton flight. They struck me as the type that rarely flew and looked very unsure as to their best course of action. They were at the kiosk when we got there and were still trying to negotiate with the rep. on the phone when we left. I hoped that they too had managed to get into a hotel but thought it was more likely that AA just let them spend the night in the airport.

TL;DR I've never had a bad experience with United, and if you're ever departing from/transferring through O'Hare don't choose American Airlines."

"2013-07-25 07:34:40"|"Are US-based airlines of lower quality? Or am I biased?"|"I just wanted to know if you fellow travellers felts that US based airlines (United and AA in my experience) are of much lower quality than airlines in Europe (Lufthansa, Air France), Canada (Air Canada) and Latin America (Avianca). For instance, United charges for entertainment (around 6 dollars) and alcohol (5 dollar beers) and just offers a shitty sandwich on a 6 hour flight (EWR-BOG). A national flight within Colombia (1 hour) had better service and free entertainment. A 6 hour flight in Air Canada (BOG-YYZ) offers free entertainment, a complete hot meal with wine or beer (+ a snack at the end) and in general much better service, while being comparable in price to United. Lufthansa is a class of its own, I have to say. 

I travel frequently from Canada to Colombia and I avoid connecting through the US (unless I can get Air Canada+Avianca) for this reason

I live in Philadelphia, so naturally I'm trying to fly out of Philadelphia, but I also searched for flights out of JFK (New York).  I went to eight different airlines (British Airways, US Airways, Delta, Virgin Atlantic, Finnair, Iberia, American Airlines, United Airlines) and regardless of whether I picked Philadelphia or JFK as my departure point, every airline ticket was $1,281.72.  

Is this normal?  I imagined all of the airlines would be similarly priced, but are they usually the same to the exact cent?  This seems like a textbook case of collusion.

The only airlines I found with different prices were Air Canada and Lufthansa. Lufthansa was about $1,305, and Air Canada was about $1,100 but with a lot of layovers.  

Is there a reason (besides collusion) that the airlines are all charging the exact same price?"

Desipite, I do consider safety and simple seating comfort. I was on delta for long time simply because that's the only plane that I have ever taken, but I thought I could try something else.

I'm seeing budget plane to be United Airline, Air Canada, and sometime Delta. If none of them are the option I'll take JAL, even though it's usually more costly.

"2017-05-22 13:50:16"|"Carry-on luggage that is ACTUALLY compliant for traveling in the US (or International)?"|"Hi all,

I have spent hours looking for a carry-on luggage that meets the 22"" x 14"" x 9"" requirements for most airlines. This itself isn't so hard to find, until you read the reviews and find out that the wheels and handles make it bigger, or for whatever reason the real measurements are not aligned with those advertised. It's incredibly frustrating that dimensions advertised are not the actual full external dimensions, and it's incredibly frustrating that companies make carry-ons that don't fit most airlines. 

Ideally, I'd like a teal or turquoise hardshell spinner/4 wheel (softshell is fine too, but I tend to overstuff my luggage so I thought a hardshell would be better for maximizing volume while setting a physical hard limit). Somewhere between 6-7lbs would be ideal. I want to maximize the carrying capacity while staying compliant (even if that means not using the expandable luggage features some bags have). 

I found this awesome luggage at Costco, but the dimensions advertised are way too big at 23.48x15.22x8.88(10?) (https://www.costco.com/Ricardo-Lombard-Hardside-Spinner-21%22-Carry-on.product.100328434.html). I'm thinking of going in and measuring it myself just to be sure. It also doesn't have a side handle, which isn't a deal breaker, but would be nice.

I found this article helpful, but it only lists two luggages that are compliant: http://www.consumerreports.org/luggage/When-carry-on-luggage-isnt-carry-on-size/

I've read that United's actual luggage containers allow an extra inch in every direction, but I know this isn't the case for other airlines. Which carry-ons do you guys use, and which do you recommend?

Thanks!

Edit: Some of the luggages I've been considering are listed below, but again I'm worried about the actual dimensions not matching the in-person dimensions. Also worried about warranty for some:

"2019-06-01 22:48:32"|"Non-frequent flyer here, why wouldn't United ship our bags? (International travel question)"|"So here's the situation ...  


Wife (US Green card holder, Kazakhstan passport holder), Kid (US Citizen) traveling from the US to Kazakhstan via Baku for the first time.  


From what I read up on: My wife being a KZ citizen could enter Baku visa free, my kid could get a transit visa on arrival if needed. (But apparently this was only if flying from JFK for some reason)  


I had to book travel on 2 different sites for their United/Luftanasa tickets for travel from the US to Baku.

Then on a smaller KZ based airline site for their hop over the Caspian sea.  


When we got our tickets departing the US the computer flagged us down because my kid didn't have a visa for Baku. I had to explain to United (Multiple times) that Baku wasn't their final destination, they were merely transiting)  


I showed travel assistance their tickets for Baku to KZ on the other airline. At first the woman freaked out because they were printed in Russian. Once I showed here the English abbreviations also on the ticket she took the tickets and passports, disappeared for 15 minutes and had to talk it over with someone else.   


She came back saying they were clear to go but couldn't ship our bags because they didn't have a transfer agreement with the Kazak airline.  I'm like 'I'm not asking you to transfer the bags. They can pick up the bags in Baku'  


Her answer came back saying for them to pick up the bags in Baku they have to exit out of the transit area.  My wife would be allow to do that, but my kid doesn't have a visa (And can't get one upon arrival), and being a minor can't be left alone.

  
I asked if they could send the bags anyways. We could have a friend/family member meet them in Baku, watch the kid, wife gets the bags and comes back. Or the wife could talk to immigration there and get special permission and let Azerbaijan decide. Or worst case scenario ditch the bag in Baku if none of the above worked out.  


No dice from United.  I asked if it was a possible terrorist thing for us to leave possible unattended baggage in Baku.  


No. They came back with the answer that it was due to not having a baggage transfer agreement with the KZ airline. And it wasn't possible for wife/kid together to pick up the bags in Baku. They were fine to travel with just carry-ons but they couldn't send the baggage.

&#x200B;

So for the frequent international flyers of Reddit: Was this a valid reason by United to refuse to ship our bags? Or was the United agent power tripping or being lazy refusing to believe there could be different outcomes?"

I know the FAQ says that one carry-on bag and one personal item are okay, but I'm curious if a backpack and a briefcase fit the bill, or will the airlines tell me no because they're both personal items?  I realize that this is probably a silly question but I haven't flown much and before I've just had the backpack only, so I'm a little paranoid. 

If it matters, the briefcase has a shoulder strap so it's really more of a smallish messenger bag (17"" in the longest dimension) and the backpack is ordinary.  Either one would fit under the seat.  It would be on a little Embraer reigonal jet (United/Expressjet), then a Boeing 777 and a Boeing 737 (both Air China).  "

Hello :)

I am a 20 (21 when travels begin) Australian student who is lucky enough to be spending 8 weeks in the UK (university-related project), 8 weeks travelling Europe, and then 6 months in Sweden on exchange. This all begins sometime in the week of 21st September 2016.

I?ve never travelled alone however, so as amazing as this trip is going to be, I would be extremely grateful if /r/travel could help me with advice, or just mentioning things I haven?t seemed to think about yet. The only downside so far is that I'll be in winter for a whole year it seems!

Thank you all in advance!


***Decisions I need to make and questions to be asked***

**How to Pack**

I?ve struggled with this question immensely. The problem boils down to going straight to exchange in January, and not returning to Australia after my UK time. It will be much easier to backpack across Europe, rather than lugging around a big suitcase, although the fact that I need to be semi-dressed up for the time in the UK already adds weight to my packing. Although I may need certain items while in Sweden, I?m thinking it?s just easier to have a box of the essentials shipped there after I begin, rather than carry it with me for 4 months. I don?t really know what backpack to get, but I?ve heard the Osprey Farpoint 40 is good, and shouldn?t be a problem to bring as carry-on.

**Laptop**

I think I HAVE to bring this if only for Sweden. I'm still using a ?New Series 9? Samsung (2012) and I really wanted to get something faster (Surface Book?) but was too worried about getting it stolen.

**Phone/Camera**

I?m still using an iPhone 5s and was planning to upgrade to the iPhone 7 this September. The problem is that I don?t know if I?ll be able to source one before I leave, and I?m now less open to purchasing the 6s even after the price drop when the 7 comes out. I would be happy to keep the 5s, but I thought it would be a good way to upgrade my phone, and have a passable camera for my travels at the same time. The DSLR is too bulky, and I strongly considered buying a GoPro to go with my 5s, but I feel that if I could get an iPhone 7, it would solve both problems (and I?m less worried about having the iPhone stolen compared to the laptop).

**Packing Cubes**

Worth it? Just thought I?d get some opinions due to the limited space etc.

**Travel Apps**

Any suggestions?

**Flight Centre Travel Voucher**

I was lucky enough to win a travel voucher and was wondering what exactly I could purchase from them? Hoping to show them a quote for my flights and Eurail pass and get those at cost price without the markup.

***Potential Problems***

**Clearing UK Immigrations/Customs**

I?ve heard that travelling into a county without a return ticket booked is asking for trouble. I?m hoping the fact that I?ll have a Eurail pass and a letter from my University/the exchange University will mitigate that.

**Entrance/Exit Fees**

I can?t find anything about these for the UK or Schengen countries so hopefully I?m all good there.


***Current Plan***

**Travel Destinations**

26 September ? 18 November: UK University Project (London, West-cliff on Sea, Lyme Regis, Liverpool). Flying from Sydney to London. Flying out from Manchester to (?)Spain.

Late November ? Early January: Europe travel. Mostly Western Europe for the first time. Eurail pass ($866 for 15 days in 2 months). Intended countries (probably doing ~1 week each): Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Luxembourg/Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden.

January ? June: Sweden exchange. Hoping to do more Scandinavian countries and Central/Eastern Europe while on exchange.

Ideally I?d keep things very flexible, but if I HAD to have an itinerary, it would be as follows:

* https://goo.gl/maps/95jQ6scXoxN2 (day trips while studying to Cambridge, Oxford etc)
* https://goo.gl/maps/uCa5gNugQbM2 
* https://goo.gl/maps/WdBqn7qTwRL2
* https://goo.gl/maps/QZPFJFgxfz42
* https://goo.gl/maps/MRcqQvpFChz
* https://goo.gl/maps/wPs7CakgK1D2

I would really love suggestions and criticisms here. I do think I?m being a little ambitious with how much I want to see, but I?d rather miss out on a few things, than run out things to see haha. What I?m most interested in is history, architecture, culture, sport, food? but really I just want to experience as much as possible. I?m not as huge on the nightclub/party scene etc, but I wouldn?t feel right not giving it a go at least.

**Accommodation**

Mostly hostels or AirBnb, depending on my mood. I?d love to meet as many new people as possible, and perhaps go on random spontaneous trips (hence the global Eurail pass), but at least during the UK studying period, I might do more AirBnbing just so I make sure I pass the unit!

I?m also hoping to do a bit of Couchsurfing. As far as I understand it, it?s a good way to meet locals and experience things from a local?s point of view, so you never know what hidden gems they may know about. I don?t have much of a Couchsurfing rep, nor have had the ability to host anyone, so I?m not expecting to spend large amount of time Couchsurfing.

I?ll be in student accommodation for the Sweden exchange hopefully.

***Logistical things I need to consider***

**Flights**

Seeing as I won?t be returning to Australia for about 10 months, and most flight deals are for return journeys, I was wondering what a good price for a one-way ticket to London from Sydney is? The cheapest I?ve been able to track down in the week I need to depart is $680 AUD flying with Philippine Airlines via Manila. I have the option of a 1 hour layover or 20 hours and I wouldn?t mind fitting exploring Manila for a day, though I?ve also heard it?s not really worth it so I?d love to hear some more opinions (including whether PA is a good carrier, Malaysia Airlines is next cheapest $859 1 way). 

**Visa**

As far as I am aware, I don?t need a visa for the UK or Europe (Schengen) with my Australian Passport. I?m not studying formally with any education institution, and for the most part I?m a tourist until I make it to Sweden for exchange. Please correct me if I am mistaken!

**Phone**

If anyone can find a better option for me regarding data etc while in Europe, please let me know, otherwise I?m looking at: http://store.three.co.uk/view/searchSimOnly?tariff=213090100 

**International Power Adapter**

I?ll probably need to get some kind of international power adapter right? From what I can tell, Europe and Australia both use 220-240 volts, but do I need a specific adapter for the prongs?

**Transportation**

I?m mainly going to rely on the Eurail pass to get me over large distances. Perhaps 15 days in 2 months is too much for me, if I want to take lots of small trips and get to more than just the big cities (i.e. countryside and villages). I?d like to drive for bits and pieces, perhaps go on a road trip with new friends. Opinions here are much appreciated.

**Money**

Currently in the process of getting a 28 Degrees MasterCard and a Citibank Plus Everyday Account (fee-free transactions and currency exchange with no annual fee)

**Immunisations**

Shouldn?t be too much of a worry where I?m going. Will just visit the GP regardless.

**International Drivers Licence**

Probably a good idea in case I feel the itch to drive

**International Student Identity Card**

Worth it at all?

I? didn?t expect there to be so much text in the post, and I?m really sorry about that! I hope it shows that I have done a bit of research so that I?m not just asking internet strangers to do all the work for me. Thank you so much if you are able to help, or even if you read down all the way to here!

Warmest Wishes,

JC"

I grew up in Las Vegas. The furthest east I have ever lived is Idaho. But after going on a Caribbean cruise in May 2013, I wanted to travel. It's all I thought about. I spent all my spare time reading about places I could visit (you all know what I was going through, I'm sure). I've always been interested in history and other cultures, and the travel really kickstarted my hunger.

So then I am browsing on reddit and I see [this post about Slovenia](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1wgr3e/so_you_want_to_come_to_slovenia_2_dogs_1_bear/). To be honest, I had no idea where Slovenia was, what it looked like, etc. Outside of the winter olympics, I had never heard of it. but it was beautiful in the photos. I realized how much I am missing. Utah is beautiful. Oregon is beautiful. But there was an entire globe I was missing out on. I read about living in Slovenia. It sounded like a place I could see myself living. 

So I started looking for jobs overseas. I looked for legal jobs in Australia and the USVI, but couldn't find anything I liked. Eventually, I stumbled on the US Foreign Service (AKA being an American Diplomat). The process was hard (acceptance rate is comparable to Harvard) and I didn't have a lot of experience, but I didn't have any kids (married) and wanted to travel while I was still young. 

Well, as of last week, I've passed every step required. My career should be starting in March. I have enjoyed my 15 or so months as a lawyer, but I can't wait to get out and meet people and speak to them in their own languages. I'll get a chance to raise my daughter (due in January!) around the world, and I think it will be a special experience for our family. I'll be working as a diplomat, which means I will move from country to country every 2-4 years, working in the American embassies. 

I've been taking notes over the last 10 months about places shared here on this sub. Places I want to live, places I want to visit, and how badly I really don't want to fly United Airlines.

So thanks to everybody on this sub, especially /u/Fbass."

Right now the best deal I've found for my times is 870 dollars on Japan Airlines, with a airport change on the return trip from Haneda to Narita, with a layover of 4 hours and 15 minutes. 
The only one I could find that didn't require at least one airport change in airport in Tokyo was a 1250 dollar flight with American Airlines (though operated primarily by JAL) and a few multi-airline flights that I'd rather not take because they'd leave me with a gigantic 10 hour layover in Shanghai, and because all of them use United for the flight from ORD to shanhai, and I hate United. 

So essentially I am left with the 1250 flight or the 870 dollar flight.
I know financially it would be worth it because the ticket from HND to NRT is 4000 yen or something like that, and I don't care about the hassle  because I will only be carrying a small carry-on bag for my return trip, which is the part that has the airport change, and I'd certainly love to get some pictures since I've only ever been to Narita.

What I'm wondering is it worth the risk? Is 4.25 hours enough to make it from HND to NRT and get on my plane? and if I were to miss it would JAL put me on another flight?

United Airlines has the option of purchasing a flexibility option for ? 70 but I'm not sure what advantage this might have. It says I have ""the lowest available refundable fare"" and ""Free-waived, same-day flight changes"" I have no idea what this means!

Called customer service who only offered small amounts of ""Delta reimbursements"" (like I would want to ever fly Delta again, since this was my first and last time, and United has given me trouble, but never like this, Southwest I love you btw).

What am I wasting space on? 

I'll be in Sukhothai, Thailand (near-ish Chiang Mai) for February and Bangalore, India for March. I'll be outdoors working with animals, will attend a conference in Bangalore, and will be working on papers. I don't anticipate a lot of time for sightseeing or tourist-y stuff. Advice other than packing is also greatly appreciated. 

Paperwork:
 - Passport and visas
 - Copies of passport and visas, insurance info (I have travel health insurance, regular insurance, and trip insurance thru airlines), plane itineraries. I'm also leaving copies of all of these things with my mother.

**Clothing**
 - Enough clothes for two weeks (Lightweight linen capris and shorts, tshirts, socks, underwear, sports bras)
 - 2-3 nice outfits for going out and conference
 - Big hat with SPF protection
 - Lightweight, compact rain coat
 - two pairs tennis shoes
 - 1 pair flip flops (for showers)
 - 1-2 pairs sandals/shoes to go with nicer outfits
 - maybe a bathing suit just in case?

**Toiletries**
 - my entire medicine cabinet (not really): benadryl, excedrin, ibuprofen, tylenol sinus, tylenol flu, cepacol, bismuth chews, unisom (for flights)
 - shampoo, body wash, facewash (all in bar form for easy packing)
 - extra contacts, contact lens necessities, glasses
 - couple toothbrushes, toothpaste
 - deodorant
 - as much sunblock as I can fit in my bag (I have a very pale complexion

**Other**
 - several notebooks and pens
 - address labels already prepped for postcards (I did a gofundme so sending to my supporters)
 - 200 USD hidden in my luggage
 - fanny pack (mostly for small notebook and pen while working

**Tech**
 - iphone/charger (for using wifi)
 - ipad/charger (mostly for plane)
 - laptop/charger
 - universal charger adapter
 - camera/charger

**Still considering**
 - Bug spray (suggestions? Neither area is much of a threat of malaria...)
 - phrase books for Thailand and India (again, suggestions?)

**Other questions**
 - How much baht/INR should I take out at the exchange? Like I said, not much touristy stuff, and in Thailand its a remote area and I'm being fed. In India, I'll be a little more on my own for food I think?
 - Are calling cards still a thing? Should I get one?

i didn't see anything in the FAQ pertaining to this."
"2017-02-17 08:43:40"|"First time flying with Spirit Airline ""the most hated airline"""|"I want to start this with saying I am not talking about everyone, some will understand where I am coming from, some won't.

I have flown countless times over the years and always went with ""big name companies"" like Delta, American, or United. I wanted to go to Vegas and fly as cheap as I could so I could do more there. After looking at flights I noticed that Spirit was by far the cheapest by $250-$400 (depending on carrier). I was shocked by this sticker price and started doing some research on the company and reading reviews. I kept reading horrible reviews and people complaining about anything and everything. Now I always take reviews with a grain of salt because most people tend to leave comments when they have been ""done wrong"" or pissed off. After much reading and thinking about it I figured I would try Spirit and see how things go. I went to their website and start booking. Everything is very clear there if take a few minutes to read. Your bare far is price of ticket... that's it. No free bags, no free carry on, no complimentary drinks/food. You literally get a spot on the plane in a seat that does not recline (which is fine as I don't ever recline my seat, and being 6'3 I prefer if the person in front of  me doesn't take my precious few inches away.) As I get farther into the booking process it tells you that you can print your own ticket or pay at the airport for your ticket, not an issue. I get to the end and my total round trip from Dallas to Vegas was $173 tax and all federal fees(and $14 for flight insurance to rebook a missed/delayed flight). Day of the flight, I get to the airport with ticket printed ready to go. I get in line to check my bag. As soon as I get into the line I see a customer having a temper tantrum. Not sure what it's about, I think great here we go, did I just make a huge mistake? The line moves and I am able to hear what's going on. They are pissed because they are asking her to pay for her bags, just as the website and the ticket she printed says. Then I see another customer complaining, same thing. As each customer moves up in line 1 out of what seemed like 5 had something to complain about, but it was all stuff that was stated on the website and even the ticket they are holding! I get to the ticket counter, check my bags no issue, as I had already paid at home (pay at home when you book and it's much cheaper). Boom now through TSA and at the gate, where yet again I see customers complaining. With spirit you can take a small personal bag but not a large carry on that most people try to take as a substitute full blown suitcase. The agents are trying to explain the rules and a few people are still pissed (yet again the information is on the site as you book, it ask you multiple times are you sure you don't want to buy now because we will charge you more at the airport.) I get on the plane now and the whole thing really is just economy seating (with the exception of the first row $35 more if you want it). The seats are just like any other economy with the exception of not reclining. The flight was 5 min late departing, but ended up making up the time. Once you are airborne they come around and offer to sell you drinks and food, honestly bring something or eat before. I don't recall the prices, but I do remember M&Ms and a Coke was $6. Return flight was the same, no delay and get back to Dallas early.

Now all that being said here is what I learned, from what I saw at the airport, I would assume the same is true for the online review, people bitch and complain because they didn't read when they booked the flight. None of it is fine print, they are blunt and upfront telling you what you get and even remind you multiple times when booking what you are paying for and what you'll be charged for at the airport if you fail to buy when booking. So no I don't think that Spirit the ""The most hated airline"" it's the airline with the most illiterate customers. If you want to fly them go for it, just read and don't blindly click. Had I not taken the extra 2 min to read what the site told me my flight would have ended costing me $400. It's a no frills airline, but after flying for years let me tell you that economy seating is economy seating and it's all the same crap when you fly. I can't say anything for what happens when you miss your flight, but you know they say to be there 2 hours ahead of time. I do that and it's never failed me.     "

This will be my first time outside of North America so i really want to make sure this trip is great!

To begin, i plan to travel in late June- mid July around 3 weeks worth of vacation. My flight is being paid for so i have around 4,000 to spend on hostels/hotels/Posadas, food, activities, ect. The reason i chose Portugal is because my grandparents loved it back when they visited. This trip will be my final chance of freedom before i get a full time job so i plan on relaxing (alot of beach time  is a preference) and getting as much culture as i can. Alsoi am a huge history buff.

My plan is to fly into Lisbon and spend a few nights there. Then head north and visit a few cities for a few days (maybe Coimbra or Porto). Then head south and spend the rest of my vacation there (maybe Lagos or faro Municipalty). I was also thinking of maybe crossing the border into Spain and visiting Seville but im still not 100 percent on that. I would lovbe to hear any suggestions on cities or areas to visit.

In terms of traveling i havent researched enough on it but i would be willing to rent a car, though traveling by train seems easier for me. I would love to hear your opinions on the best way of getting around Portugal. 

This question is for flying to Europe. Not to reveal to much info on where i am from i would be flying out of the bay area. What is the best way to fly to Europe in terms of routes. Also what airlines would you recommend. The only airline i have experience with is United for cross country flights (i would rate them a 3/5).

I reside in Canada and will be moving abroad to work in Taiwan. After a lot of research it's still unclear how my French Bulldog can be in the airplane cabin with me (I am worried that things can go wrong after all the events that happened with United).

Air Canada allows pets in cabins under certain conditions. One of[Air Canada pet policy](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/plan/special-assistance/pets.html) mentions the following: 

Your pet cannot travel with you in the cabin if you:

?Are travelling in Premium Economy on a Boeing 787-8 (788), Boeing 787-9 (789) or A330-300 (333) aircraft

and then it says 

?On Boeing 777-300ER and 777-200LR  aircraft, the pet carrier cannot exceed these dimensions :

...dimensions are given...

The problem now is that some of the flights I found are only the Boeings 787-8 (788), 787-9 (789), or A330-300 (333) ..

OR....

It starts with a 777-300ER/777-200LR   and then because of a layover it's then a Boeing 787-8 (788), 787-9 (789), or A330-300 (333).

I'm open to travel with other airlines if I have to but I'd prefer having my dog with me because of Brachycephalic condition.

**Questions that need to be answered:**

\- what kind of papers do you specifically need to show once landing in Taiwan?

\- do you need to contact the embassy of the foreign country that you bring your pet?

\- how long do they stay in quarantine if its necessary?

\- Does anyone have experience and how did it go?

\- What are your recommendations?

"2019-09-12 23:22:38"|"Is this a normal flying experience?"|"I was flying from Minnesota to Turkey about 3 weeks ago now. I had a pretty tough time while flying over here (this might be biased, I have never flown alone before).

My flight from MSP to O'Hare was delayed by an hour (poor weather conditions), and I ended up missing my flight to Dublin. I suppose I should have given more time to make my next flight, but my boyfriend wrote the itinerary. Fortunately, when I spoke to a United Airlines employee, they were able to rewrite my itinerary to make it to Turkey. 

They suggested flying through Washington DC - Munich - Turkey (final destination). 

There was an additional flight leaving for Munich the next evening (mind you, it was 10 pm local time, the plane to Munich was leaving at 6 pm or so the next evening). I opted for this because I would get to Turkey at the same time (and I prefer to take fewer planes). 

I was given a cot to sleep in until 4am. I would have graciously appreciated keeping the cot longer because I desperately needed sleep, and I was definitely not too ladylike sleeping on the chairs inside the airport. 

6 pm slowly inched closer, and I boarded the plane to Munich. Things were going really well until I was asked to get off the plane to talk to someone. 

A Border and Customs officer was concerned by my rapid flight schedule changes. Apparently, when I was having my new itinerary written, the employee didn't view possible itineraries, he scheduled me on all of them. I was asked for my personal information, my name, my passport number, where I was going....blah blah....

I was allowed to board the plane, god bless, I was crying at this point. 

My total travel time was about 48 hours, I left Monday morning, and arrived Wednesday morning (with respects to MN time, it was Wednesday evening in Turkey). 

I encountered no issues in Munich, it was so pretty!!!

I did, however, lose my luggage. I just got it back 2 days ago, they found it in Munich. My boyfriend was happy when it came, I brought some vanilla coke in the suitcase (they don't sell it here). I guess a good ending?"

110,000 points saved with Citi thankyou. Points are transferrable to Turkish Airlines, Asia Miles, Avianca Lifemiles, Ethiad Guest, Eva Air, Flying Blue (KLM, Airfrance), jetpriveledge, quantas, quatar airlines, singapore airlines, virgin atlantic and a few others. 
Points would transfer at a 1:1 rate for miles. 

I've been doing research, and I keep seeing ads or promotions for ""business class to greece on this date"" from Flying Blue for 62500 miles, but as soon as I try to find the dates or anything near it, it's generally from 185,000+ miles on anything close. 

I've done a lot of research on different airlines and prices around this date, and the advertised lowest prices stem from United (~70k miles for one way) and Delta/AirFrance (advertised 62,500), but like I said above, I can't actually find that anywhere.  

Extra things to know: my wife and I spend about $3,000 a month and can always open new credit cards. The trip is in a long time so we could theoretically do another card (or two) to get the additional bonus miles. 

Dates are flexible, but we do want to capitalize on or near that exact time stated (sept 8th in to athens, sept 21 out of Rome). 

Any advise on which airlines I should transfer miles to? Or who can get me the most out of our money? Business class would be amazing if possible. "

They are putting us on a 9:10AM flight from Boston to SFO arriving at 12:55. The NZ flight stays the same so we will be in SFO for 10 hours, but we don't care.They are doing an even exchange so it does't even cost us anything.

-----

My husband and I have our trip from Boston to New Zealand coming up next Saturday. We leave from Boston at 6PM and arrive in SFO at 9:51PM their time.

We then have a 54 minute connection to get from there to our next flight at 10:45PM, which goes straight to New Zealand.

Everyone I have talked to says this is insane, but United has assured me multiple times that it's a legal connection. Our next option is one with a 7 hour layover in SFO (not a big deal to us), but we most likely will not be able to sit together (also online it is making me pick our seats again for ALL the flights, including the one from SFO to New Zealand even though that is the same flight we have currently - of course there are no longer seats beside each other for the 13 hour flight to NZ).

We booked separately with our MileagePlus cards so we could use points (normally a $3,000 flight we paid $75 for taxes/fess). Neither of us fly much, so I picked this flight without realizing just how risky the connection was. 

We are taking carry-on bags only to help cut down on time, and the flight is the same throughout (all United Airline flights), but it does mention a ""Terminal change"" on the itinerary.

I am panicking. What do others think?  "

I am going to be flying with both British Airways and Aer Lingus for the first time, and just wanted to get a general idea of what my cross-Atlantic flight with them will be like, and how they compare to other airlines: I've flown with United, Delta, Southwest, and Lufthansa in the past."
"2019-09-07 18:23:54"|"New Business Traveler- Seeking Reward Advice (Domestic US Travel)"|"If this post is better for another sub, I?d welcome that feedback. 

Just got a new job where I?ll be traveling 35-45 weeks/year. I?ve never travelled for work and don?t know how to maximize benefits/rewards for frequent flying and hotel stays. I?m a little overwhelmed with all of the programs and how they work. 

I will mostly stay in Marriott hotels. I will usually have the option to fly either Delta or United. 

I?ll stay in hotels much more than I?ll fly, because I will do a lot of driving to my work locations. I will fly 10-20 times/year, but I?ll be in hotels for well over 200 nights per year. I like the idea of doing a brand loyal program because of the upgrades that come along with them (like flight upgrades, airport lounges, free checked bags, hotel suite upgrades, free hotel stays). 

Therefore, is my best option to go with two separate cards, one Marriott rewards card and one either United or Delta? Are there cards that combine the two?  Or because I'm staying in hotels more than flying, should I just get a Marriott card and strictly use that for all travel expenses then just accrue airline miles as I fly by being a member of the program without a card (and also have the option of transferring Marriott points to Delta or United)?  

Any advice on travel cards or how to maximize rewards is greatly appreciated.?"

I've heard a lot of bad things about United, so my expectations are really low. What are some things I can do to make this experience not so shitty?

In total, I'm taking four flights with them. LAX to EWR (red-eye), EWR to BOS. Then on my return trip, BOS to SFO and SFO to LAX.

I think I'm the most scared about my baggage being lost and missing a connecting flight. I usually only take a carry on (my trips elsewhere are usually short), but since I will be gone a week I will for sure have to check in a bag. So I really hope nothing gets lost. Also, looking at the flights I have booked, I have about an hour to an hour and a half between connecting flights. I hope I don't miss any :(

I was going to buy my ticket this week. And was wondering if any of you have any experience with that route and/or have suggestions on good airlines. I've read that Air New Zealand is good. But right now United/ Lufthansa / Air Canada is the cheapest. 

Also is it better to wait and see if ticket prices drop? I'm about 2 months from departure. (March 6). I've the tickets seemed to have drop around $100 since about a month. Will there be a chance for more price drops? Or should I lock it down now? I'm trying to get it in the $800-$900 range. Lowest is around $822 right now. 


Sorry for the long post. Any help or info or advice would be much appreciated! Thanks!







UPDATE: I paid $828. I'm only 7 weeks out and I'm comfortable with the price right now and don't want to risk it going back up. Taking United out there but my flights back are done by Lufthansa so that's good! Thanks for all the advice and information! "
"2014-05-15 18:25:25"|"A Long Return Home, or ""Why I will never book again with United"", a 3-day Odyssey across Americans airports."|"This whole adventure began as a trip between friends. I had a previous bad experience with United, but I'd like to believe that shit happens and that people deserve a second chance. I applied the same mentality to United. That was mistake #2 (#1 is booking with United in the first place).

So Monday morning, my trip partners and I are waiting at the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport. Finding out we are splitted on 2 different flights, they depart for Philly while I'm waiting for my flight to Chicago. The original flight plan was Minneapolis-Chicago/3 hours layover/Chicago-Halifax,NS (ETA 00:15 or so...).

About 30 minutes before departure (I was becoming worried since usually they start boarding at this point) there is no plane to be found for the flight. On departure time, they announce that the flight is cancelled since the plane has mecanical issues. Still trying to stay positive, I get rebooked for the next flight since it doesn't impact my connecting flight (Ill simply spend 3 hrs in Minneapolis instead of Chicago). We finally depart the airport with a bit of delay, heading for Chicago.

It was supposed to be a short flight. After a good nap, I wake up and the lady next to me start to get worried since she said she'll be late for her connecting flight if we don't get to Chicago soon. I also notice the plane goes into a circular flight path and doesn't seem to start the approach maneuvers. The pilot finally announce that we are being diverted to Grand Rapids, MI for a quick refuel since thunderstorms are stopping airport activities.


My optimistic attitude began to fade away at this point. 


We land in Grand Rapids, MI and the pilot inform us that we are required to leave the plane. Being aware of some of the safety precautions we have to take in the Navy in regards to fuelling, we are told to wait in the terminal. After a couple of hours and the inability to get any answer from either the pilot, the crew or event the airport staff, I start to question myself. The clock display 05:40 PM

Then suddenly, the pilot and the rest of the crew re-embark the plane to depart, without the passengers. They unloaded the luggages and ditched us in the fine commune of Grand Rapids. *slow claps* The clock displays 08:30-09:00 pm approx.

The poor staff at Grand Rapids airport were as flabbergasted as we were. They were doing everything they could, but re-booking about 40 pissed of passengers is quite a task for 2 individuals. At this point I was aware that I would not make it home in time. So Im trying to contact my bosses and inform them of my location. After receiving confirmation that they know what kind of shit show Im in, I try to rebook a flight with the exhausted staff from the airport. Keep in mind that at the same time, 3-4 flights came in, refuelled and left for their destination already. Only the United flight I was on got stranded there (as far as I know, please correct me if I'm wrong).

After a bit of discussion with the staff, they found a way to provide me with an hotel room since my first flight was a mecanical failure and not an ""Act of God"" (*srly???*). They also rebook me for a flight the upcoming afternoon, but also put me on standby for the 12:30 flight for Chicago. At this time, the clock display 03:20 AM

After a short night of sleep, I'm heading back to Gerard R. Ford airport (aka Grand Rapids, MI airport), hoping to get on that flight I'm on standby for. The airport staff are able to provide me with a ticket for that flight and Im getting ready to board the flight to O'Hare.
Seems like my stroke of bad luck is about to end. The clock now displays 12:00 PM.


**WRONG!**


After delaying the flight twice, they announce us over speaker that O'Hare has an issue (aka fire in the bathroom....SRLY???) in the Control Tower and diverted more flight to that tiny airport (read here 1 concession stand in the boarding area and 2 bathroom). The airport staff is overloaded and getting slowly tired of the pile of shit they are rerouting to their tiny airport.

I'm slowly becoming aware that I won't probably make it either today to Halifax, and get in touch with my boss again saying that I'm still stranded in the US. As a joke, I started debating if I should start to fill paperwork for my citizenship. I should have. It is now 5:00 pm.

After getting cleared , they board a flight nobody heard about for Chicago. The guy that tried to sort my issue and was able to issue me an hotel room for the night is back at this point. After seeing me, noticing that there is one First Class seat available and being aware that I only have my backpack and a small bag, book me and sends me to Chicago on this flight. In the meantime, he also announce me that my flight to Halifax was delayed and that I will be able to catch it.
To that Ginger guy in Grand Rapids, thank you. You're one of the 2 people that were able to help me get back home.

So, I'm finally in Chicago. Im heading to my gate. My hopes of getting home and seeing my GF are fairly high at this point. It is 5:40pm. My flight is scheduled for 6:30pm with an ETA of 11:50pm.
I grab food at the McD since it's almost right next to my gate and begin the wait. Then....Gate swap! Followed by another gate swap!


Then the second night of adventure begins....


At 6:15pm, they delay the departure for 7:30pm. Not a big deal I think since I'll be home tonight. Here I was wrong again.
This pattern got repeated until 11:00pm that night. Then, they finally cancelled it. We were actually the last flight that got cancelled that night. That wasn't playing in my favor. 


In the meantime, I met 3 girls travelling back to Halifax from Louisiana and 1 dude that was on a 1-day business trip also trying to head back to Nova Scotia. So we tackled the problem of finding a solution to get our asses back into Canucks Country. Time is now 00:00am.

After being told to go to Customer Service/Help desk by the United employees, we came to the realisation we were the last flight that got cancelled and that a horde of angry/tired/pissed off passengers were already trying to get rebooked for another flight.

Here comes the comedy relief of this episode. Mid-40s, half bad, overweight and slightly dumb United employed. He divert us towards a free United counter in order to try to help us. Then he gives us a 1-800 number we should call to try to rebook. I'm about to lose my temper at this point. I simply inform him that if he wants us to do that, I'll gladly do it if United agrees to pay for the upcoming phone bill since all of us are on roaming at this point. He looked like someone explained him that the Earth is actually round and not flat at this point. Then a nice United lady came and booked us on an American Airlines flight to Toronto with a connection to Toronto. I was really skeptical at this point since the travel time and the connection to Halifax didn't make sense, but I had a ticket with someone else than United, so I shut my yapper and hoped for the best. I also inquired for an hotel room with the half-bald guy that graciously (Im being sarcastic here) that a fire in the tower is not United's fault. I then inform him that if I'm in Chicago today, it's because United originally FUCKED UP (I'm becoming slightly aggresive at this point...) and that I think I deserve something better than a chair based on their inability to get shit straight. After a long chain of bla bla blas and informing him that I will make sure to never fucking travel again with United and that he was a proud representation of the company he worked for (in other words, retarded, fighting against evolution and would greatly improve the overall quality of life of any living organism on this planet by dissapearing).

Vacating the premises with the 3 cute girls that were heading to Halifax, we find a concession restaurant with booths and sleep on these uncomfortable pieces of shit. We tried to find cots, but they were all taken at the time we completed the shenanigans with the ""more-than-competent"" staff from United.
Time 01:30 AM


Fast forward to 4:00 AM, I woke up to the sound of PA announcements. Myself and the 3 girls (I only remember the name of the cute blonde one. She was a real hottie and we had good laughs together) are heading the the American Airlines boarding area where we are supposed to get on our flight to Toronto. After discussing with the lady at the desk we find out that we are in fact NOT on this flight or any other that the United staff confirmed us we were on. But that lady did an amazing work and got all 4 of us on that plane in direction of Toronto.

After landing in Toronto, we figure out that we wont be able to get our boarding passes AND the girls luggages in time to make it to our next flight to Halifax.

After getting thru customs, I'm heading to Air Canada ticketing booth. There the lady look a bit shocked by the things I give her (originally provided by the United staff) but finds a way to put me on the 2:30 PM flight to Halifax. The girls didn't had my chance. Their luggages never got loaded into the first flight (AA's one) and got then rerouted thru Montreal to get to Halifax eventually way later than me.

I finally landed in Halifax at 5:30 pm (Atlantic Time) after a 3 day odyssey around America's airports.

If there's a morale to find in my store, it would be something like : Just don't book with United. Pay that extra 2-300$ and have peace of mind. I lost 2 days of works and if it wasn't of that ginger guy in Grand Rapids and the short lady at the American Airways desk in O'hare, I would have submitted my immigration papers.

Not sure if anyone will see this but I don't really know where else to post this and I just feel so anxious and stressed and I don't know how airports/flights work...

So I'm about to return to college but my flight (United Airlines) at 5AM gets delayed by 3 hours - and it means I would miss my connecting flight which departs at 8AM. I naturally freaked out and I saw that on the app United was offering travel waivers because of storms and weathers - which would let me change my flight to another one which I thought was a good idea!

I changed my flight to be tomorrow instead to avoid this issue because I thought that I would be stranded at the airport if I missed my connecting flight. I don't really fly airplanes that much, but I did some research online and read some comments about people saying that if you miss a connecting flight not of your own fault, the airline will help get you on the next flight!

I didn't know about this and now I'm feeling really stupid and anxious - is this really true? Did I just unnecessarily delay my travel by a day just because I'm stupid? I tried to change my flight back to the original one - but it wouldn't let me change back...

I'm so stressed and I don't know if this same situation is going to happen again tomorrow where I will miss a connecting flight due to weather delays/etc. and I don't know how to handle missing a connecting flight. Will I really be stranded at the airport? I would really appreciate any help if anyone is able to offer advice.

Thank you so much!!! <3"
