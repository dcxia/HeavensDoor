They advertise their special blue club or whatever by shoving a minute long sales pitch down your throat. It's infuriating because you can't escape it since you are confined to the plane and if you're watching a movie it comes through the headphones. 

Any other airlines doing this? I'm seriously considering switching airlines now. Something about forcing ads into my brain is very triggering to me."

I've been looking at JetBlue, who I've flown with before and never had an issue with, and Frontier. JetBlue is my preferred choice because I trust them. But they have a massive layover that I want to avoid. Just wondering if anyone has flown with Frontier before, and if so, how is the quality?"
2,What Airline out of these would you recommend most?,2,3ait97,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/3ait97/what_airline_out_of_these_would_you_recommend_most/,15,2015-06-20 20:35:22,"I'm not sure if this was the correct subreddit to post this on, but anyway, I'm planning on taking a trip to Miami, Florida the end of next week. The only reasonable flights are flying Frontier to and between Frontier, US Airways, and American Airlines flying back. I've only ever flown JetBlue before, and have only ever had good experiences with them.

My question is, basically, how are your experiences onboard with those airlines? Like, with JetBlue, you get free snack and beverages, and are also able to watch tv. Although, those things are not important to me, but they definitely make the trip more comfortable.

My friend(who is a huge enthusiast of anything aircraft and also works at an airport) recommended Delta over American. So basically, which airline/s out of the ones I've mentioned would you most recommend? I know it probably doesn't matter, but I figured I ask for everyone's opinion on which they prefer."

9,Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it...,3,7ac8ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7ac8ox/could_us_legacy_carriers_bring_back_domestic_3/,3,2017-11-02 19:26:46,"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?"
10,"Jet Blue, I'm sorry I can't use your website, so I can't use your flights.",0,25mpvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/25mpvq/jet_blue_im_sorry_i_cant_use_your_website_so_i/,2,2014-05-15 19:15:51,"After several failures to use JetBlue's reservation site with different browsers I sent them a note asking them what's up.  This is the second time I've had the problem, the first time I called and made the reservation on the phone.  This time I'm just taking a different airline, and I replied with a ""Goodbye"" email.

It turns out that, despite their website saying they support Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, according to their email the site only works in Explorer.  Here is what they said:

> Please be sure that you are using Internet Explorer as your browser, when accessing www.jetblue.com.  Safari and Firefox work adequately but not as dependably as Internet Explorer. Please avoid using Google Chrome, as due to computer capabilities this can give you unexplained an untraceable errors.

Here is my reply - perhaps I was harsh, but I generally like flying Jet Blue, they are the only airline that flies out of the nearest airport to me, so it's disappointing.  I will add that neither Firefox nor Chrome worked.

>I thought this might be the problem.  I tried using your site with several different browsers and it was broken with all of them.

>First, even the US Government is recommending that people stop using Explorer due to flagrant repeated security issues.

>Second, I don't use Microsoft machines at all.  I don't have anything that will even run Explorer.  And neither does an increasing proportion of the flying public.

>Third, Explorer is slow, not standards compliant, and if you ask your web team they will tell you is so broken that 1/2 their time is spent making accommodations for the failure of Explorer to work like EVERY OTHER BROWSER.  That is, unless your web team is so amateurish that they are doing nothing BUT Explorer.  That is an approach that even a three-person startup company no longer uses.

>If Jet Blue insists on continuing to be Explorer centric, I will be forced to stop flying Jet Blue.  As far as I have found, you are the only airline that has this old, lame, stupid approach to the web. I'm sorry this is necessary - I like flying Jet Blue but if I can't make reservations I can't fly.

>I highly recommend that you pass this on to someone in management who can take steps to fix this amazing level of stupidity, carelessness, or ignorance in your IT department.

12,JetBlue: We Are Raising Fares And Fees!,1,9qwgx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/9qwgx9/jetblue_we_are_raising_fares_and_fees/,2,2018-10-24 08:12:09,"“We’re raising fares and fees because our fuel bill is sky high and travel demand is strong”

JetBlue Airways confirmed what anyone who has shopped for airlines tickets lately already knew: the airline, like its competitors, has been aggressively raising fares to offset sharply higher fuel costs. 

Airlines executives are often reluctant, at least publicly, to admit that tickets prices are on the rise, using industry jargon like “improving yields” to talk about the fare climate.

St. George said jet blue led “several” successful industry fare increases in the July- September quarter and also led the industry’s baggage fees higher.

In late August, JetBlue became the first major airlines to hike baggage fees. The new charges will be $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for second checked bag, up from $25 and $ 30. Alaska airline’s bag fees are due to increase in December. 

Airlines are able to pass along fuel costs because travel demand is strong from business travelers and vacations. On united airlines’ quarterly conference call last week, President Scott Kirby, called it “one of the best revenue environments we’ve ever seen.”"
13,"Double booked, only one charge...",1,98lm2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/98lm2m/double_booked_only_one_charge/,2,2018-08-19 20:50:40,"So I was just trying to book a flight with JetBlue. I got to the lady screen, hit confirm, and got an error message. Tried a couple more times to no avail. Tried on the app, same deal. Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed.
Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.
Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts. Not from a morality stand point, thank you; I can make that decision myself and don't need the internet's thoughts on right and wrong. I'd like to hear if anybody knows how this will play out. Thanks!

On Wednesday August 21, 2019, I left Regina for Toronto at 6:40am(ish), I arrived in Toronto about 3 hours later, I was filled with hope. 
The flight was supposed to be leave at 2:50, I would be back in Jersey for 4:20, and it would be easy to train the train from Newark airport, to my place in Waldwick, NJ. 
That flight got delayed until about 4:45, but alas, they still boarded the plane, telling us about 10 minutes later, hey guys, its going to be an hour due to a ground stop – okay, just an hour on this hot plane, nothing to---- “Excuse me passengers, they have cancelled this flight” ---- shhhiiii…
So rebooking occurs, initially wanting to throw me in for Friday at 6:40am, here I am knowing I need to get back to work by Friday, thinking that won’t do, so I manage to get squeezed in for Thursday at 6:50; not ideal, but hey, it could be worse.
Me thinking, well the flight was cancelled because of weather, but was delayed because of AirCanada own problems in Chicago trying to get the plane here, and then apparently having to find a different plane for us to take to Newark – but hey, AirCanada doesn’t take responsibility, sure that delay was our fault, and had we been on time we would have been the storm system, but we screwed up, got here late, and had to cancel because of it – but we will blame the weather, lest we comp a hotel room for a guy. So what can I do, it’s a late flight out, I can’t be at an airport all night, all day and all afternoon waiting for the evening flight – guess I will have to fork out money for a hotel. 
Then, all day Thursday, I am tracking the storms, thinking they gotta cancel, they gotta cancel, but 6:20 comes around, Air Canada boards us, and then we sit on the runaway for 30 minutes, I am thinking, here it comes, we are getting cancelled we are getting…and we are taking off? We get 20 minutes away from Newark, when I see we are doing circles in the sky – this is normal, Newark sometimes makes you hang out for another 30-45 minutes, they won’t make us – “Excuse me passengers, we are being told to hold for 3 hours, and we don’t have the fuel to do that, so we are going back to Toronto”
Shiiiiiiii
Land, sorry bro, can’t get you to Newark tomorrow, or Saturday; can get you to Laguardia though? 
Me…well if I take the bus from LaGuardia to the subway terminal in Jamaica, then the subway to Penn Station in Manhattan, then NJ Transit to Secaucus and finally NJ Transit from Secaucus to Waldwick, I can get home tomorrow? Guess we are going for “Attempt #3: LaGuardia Edition”
2 cancellations, what does AirCanada say? Sorry bro, weather.  
Here’s hoping when regulations go into play, some MP puts a clause in saying you can’t blame weather, if the original screw up that delayed a flight long enough for weather to be an issue, makes it still your fault. 
P.S. JetBlue is the best airline in North America, and if it ever goes to Canada, you and WestJet will have to be better. When they were delayed by WEATHER for 8 hours, what did they do? Come out, give us their selection of snacks, which is much better than the pretzels AirCanada stocks, and bottles of water, because that’s what a good company that cares about its customers does."

Alaska will charge $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for the second, in line with new prices at JetBlue, American, Delta and United, according to a new fee chart on its website. JetBlue set $30 and $40 as the new industry benchmark when it hiked its fee in August.

Alaska passenger face a bigger increase in the charge for a second bag than passenger on other airlines because Alaska has been charging $25 for the second checked bag, compared with $35 before the increase as other carriers.

Alaska is also increasing the price for a third checked bag, to $100 from $75. That is still below the $150 fee charged by American, United and delta.

Overpacking will cost Alaska passengers more, too. The airline increased the fee for an overweight bag to $ 100 from $75. All bag fees are each way, per person.

Southwest Airlines are the only U.S. carrier offering free checked bags. Passengers are allowed to check two bags for free. Weight and size limits apply."

Now here’s why, May 31’st 2014 I booked myself a flight from SNA “John Wayne” to SEA “Seattle” for October 3rd 2014 along with this so called “insurance”. Why I booked this flight was due to an event I am attending and I thought it was a great deal “at the time”. A month had past and some information was given to me by my peers informing me I should switch the fight to October 2nd and be there a day early as I am needed this day. Well immediately I contact United and was informed of their terrible policy in changing flights with all their outrageous fee’s and fare changes. I was informed to contact the insurance company as they should be able to handle this for me. Well this insurance company had no connection with United and had failed to mention that it is only for the event of an illness or unexpected emergency “would be nice if they provided this in details (not just in the fine print) before purchasing”. So I contact United again “mind you this is still about 3 months or more ago” and asked what my options where. I was told I can call 24 hours before the flight and pay a flat fee of 75.00 dollars to switch fights under same day. I thought ok I can do this but to protect myself I continued to search other flights and found JetBlue had a non-stop from Long beach to Seattle for 100.00 bucks. How could I say no right? So I contacted United again to verify and was informed by a second person that yes that’s correct. 24 hour same day is a flat 75.00 dollars. So I clearly said ok I will just do that option. The months have now past and one week ago September 26th 2014 I contacted United again to verify that this really is happening and I could be changing my flight 24 hours in advanced to the exact same flight a day prior “well 26 hours to be exact” and was informed “YES it is 75.00 dollars and I would change it for you now if I could” I was told. I thought awesome this will be fine, I’m only going to spend 75.00 extra and get there a day early. 48 hours before my flight, I call United again to verify and low and behold I’m given the “no sir that is incorrect” “you cannot change your flight for 75.00 dollar’s, you must pay 200.00 change fee plus airfare at 151.00 for a total of 351.00…” Excuse me??? My months and weeks of calling to making sure THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN has HAPPENED. I was in shock so I ask to speak to a manager. Well Mr. Manager gets on the phone and we get to the break down. Well it all gets broken down to that YES you can get that flight for a fee of 75.00 dollars, phew. Well here we are October 2nd 2014. I Call this morning about 30 hours before my flight to verify and am told “YES you will be able to get on the flight for 75.00 dollars bur we can’t do it for you yet” I asked if it’s best for me to do it at the airport and the gentleman informed me that YES that would be best. (26 hours before my flight) I arrive at SNA and go straight to the counter and am greeted by a nice lady, I give her the whole spiel why I’m here and she looks at me confused. I am now told “no, no the 75.00 dollar change fee is only for same day. You will now have to pay a 150.00 dollar change fee and airfare…” WHAT??? Well ladies and gentlemen I am speechless. I would get nothing out of this women as she is typing away and not even looking at me. I request my papers back and call United AGAIN, and finally someone within the States answers. I give the WHOLE run down of what has happened and why I am now at the airport looking like an idiot. I am told by her that (with attitude mind you) “oh your fare doesn’t qualify for the 75.00 dollar change fee, I don’t know why you were being told this...” WAIT WHAT? What am I to do now? I need to get to Seattle like NOW! Here is what my answer was and the option I was given “pay the change fee’s OR WAIT FOR IT… I can pay a 75.00 change fee for a different flight the next day….” WOW I am in shock. Didn’t she just tell me my fare was not allowed for the changed fee but now it is on another flight? Well let’s just say United has done NOTHING for me other than get me to Seattle a few hours earlier by paying a 75.00 change fee… Guys and Gals, I urge you all too please rethink before EVER flight United. They are crooks, liar’s and thieves. No one knows what they are talking about and all they want to do is take your money and provide poor service.
