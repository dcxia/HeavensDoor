Next on the list is tasks/mission and figuring out the itinerary. We have Reddit's traveling salesman problem. 

Can the JetBlue employee or the mods who are in touch with JetBlue get the destinations and flight timings for the Pass duration (Sep 8 - Oct 8)?
Anything would be better than the [flash site](http://www.jetblue.com/wherewejet/). 

Then we can construct a graph and work on the schedule."

* On August 19, the [KickStarter Project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/217295376/reddit-jetblue-travel-challenge) receives the required $680 in funds, about [three hours after it was started](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9bsyz/update_reddit_jetblue_travel_challenge/c0c65o6).
*  Saydrah starts a [voting thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9c6c2/hey_askreddit_who_should_we_send_on_a_monthlong/), where redditors are asked to select their top choice among six candidates that have been screened over the phone.

* Saydrah [asks for more donations](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9c83c/do_you_want_to_send_not_one_but_two_redditors_on/), so that two travelers can be sent, instead of just one.

* They have a handy menu of their drinks and snacks in the seat-back pockets.  On some flights they also read out the list.  I recommend the Doritos Munchies Mix.  
* The seats are comfy!  (leather-like, not hard at all, lots of give)
* Don't expect to borrow a blanket or pillow for free.  You have to buy them for $7.  And if the plane's not full, it will be cold!
* They have cable TV and satellite radio, unlike other airlines with movie selections.  Don't forget your earphones; theirs cost $2.
* You can watch a sneak preview of a tv pilot if you want (at least you could last week).  Called something like ""Modern Family.""  Up to you guys, but I tried a few minutes and found it to be god-awful.

Some things I'd be curious to keep track of:

* How many pilots crack jokes?  (mine were 1 of 4; on my last flight the Pilot said, ""We have two of our best Flight Attendants with us today.  And we have Stephanie.""  That put a big grin on her face as she repeated for people in the next 10 minutes that yes, she was Stephanie.)   
* How much of the time do they use their little map-channel where you get to follow where the plane is?  (3 of 4 on mine)  
* How often were flights delayed?  (none of mine in any way)  
* How often did flights land early? (I think 2 of mine did.  Between 10 and 30 min early)"

So a few years ago, like in 2007 or something, I had purchased a round trip ticket from Jet Blue from Long Beach, CA to JFK or LGA (I forgot which it was, but it was NY).  I was scheduled to return to Long Beach on Monday, leaving at 6am in the morning.  At around 11 pm at night, as I am sleeping, I get a phone call.  I finally decide to answer it but it's already gone to voicemail.  Turns out to be a recorded message saying ""due to weather conditions, your Jet Blue flight has been cancelled.  Please check jetblue.com to reschedule your flight"".  So I immediately log on to jetblue and discover that ALL the flights to Long Beach are booked until WEDNESDAY.  So i call them and beg them to get me on a flight because I have to get to work on Monday.  Sorry, they say, we are booked until Wednesday.  What's that?  Oh, sorry we don't partner with other airlines so we can't get you on another flight with anyone else.  What's that? Oh, I'm really sorry, I know it's not raining but it might be tomorrow morning.  What's that?  Oh, don't worry, we will refund you the unused portion of your ticket. 

God I was pissed.  I had to go to Delta to get a flight out at 5pm and got back to Los Angeles at 11 pm and I paid $800, that was the CHEAPEST one way ticket they had for Monday.  Jet Blue refused to re-imburse me for it.  The worst part of it was that Delta is based out of LAX.  So after I got back, I had to hail a cab to drive me to Long Beach to pick up my car at Jet Blue.  They even refused to pay for that!  I was so mad I called them after fuming about it for a few days and they gave me a link and told me to fill out my complaint (or send an email to someone, I forgot, it was a while ago) so I did that and they sent me a $50 gift voucher for a future Jet Blue flight.  Sorry, that's the best we can do sir.  

It was the worst experience I ever had with an airline."

A rough network of collaborators helped to make this happen. The conductors of this railroad risked their livelihood and, most likely, their lives to look beyond societal norms of the day and set out to inform and rescue those who needed it most. The unnamed stations that served to hide those who desired freedom. 

We now have a chance once again to rescue those who yearns for freedom from the daily doldrum of modern living. For the lifers who wake up early in the morning before sunrise and look out to the night for some sign of inspiration that never seems to come. For those who zombies through the daily grind of life, whether it be coursework or corporate, hoping to be reanimated at the end of the day only to be pitched back to the brainless life once the alarm goes off the next day. For they who grasped at their final chance to experience a nomadic life that comes once in a lifetime...or in this case, for the past 2 years. 

I propose we make a _Reddit Crosscountry Highway_ for those who have taken the the JetBlue Challenge and is using it to live life simply on the road. To allow those who want to escape or just to enjoy a new way of living for this brief period.

**For Travelers:**

* *Meeting stations:* Suggest an airport hub or prominent city location to act as a meeting spot for those who desire to travel with another redditor for one leg of the journey and/or beyond
* *Waypoints/Points of Interests:* Suggest a point of interest or event you know coming up that other people taking the journey might enjoy
* *People of interest*: Introduce people you've met on your journey that doesn't use Reddit/don't know about this Highway to those that come to the city after you. (This might need to be done exclusively through PMs as a protection barrier)

**For those not on the journey but inclined to help the travelers:**

* *Agents* to act as guides, willing to show those who visit around their city or even just to offer suggestions on where to go
* *Rest stations* for those who are weary at the end of day: A generous redditor willing to offer up their residence to those who are traveling for the night


Suggestions needed and are quite welcomed.

I just got back into town (BOS) from TPA.  When I was down there I figured for the first time ever, I would give my friends a break and rent a car.  Jetblue is running this awesome deal through hertz, where if you rented a car for 5+ days you can earn 1,500 extra trueblue points.  Bonus!  It worked out, but the person @ HERTZ didn't apply the promotion code.

Sadly, i'm in the process of trying to get these points applied but I wanted to give you guys the heads up when booking at the rental counter to make sure to mention the promotional code so it will be applied correctly.

Aside from that, It was a solid trip."

As well, the same flights came up on Priceline at $1,900.

1) I am a bacon chef. 

2) I am a science fiction writer currently suffering from a writer's block.

3) I am an avid drinker, and am fun to be around. I never pass out and I never cockblock.

4) I have a camera, and I'm not afraid to use it.

5) I know over 9000 memes and promise to use them only under the most dire of circumstances.

6) I'm attractive and I can do cartwheels. But I'm a man, so you'll still be able to relate to me.

7) I live in a small town in Arizona and if I don't get the fuck out of here, I'm going to die.

8) I am quite fastidious and will not clog your toilet if I stay at your house. Also, I use words like ""fastidious.""

9) I think sleeping is for suckers, so you'll get the most bang for your buck out of me.

10) I am capable of composing a blog or website of the adventure that will be engaging and fun, and will promote the greatness of JetBlue and Reddit and bacon.

11) I have the perfect backpack for this. 

12) I will do whatever is asked of me, provided it won't injure or kill me. I've eaten chicken feet and had my cock pierced and I doesn't afraid of anything.

13) I have a fantastic username. 

14) I want to visit the Creation Museum! You know you want a picture of me riding the saddled dinosaur while wearing a Reddit shirt.

15) I will bring trinkets to geocache at every location I visit. Maybe Soapier can help with this. ;)

16) I'll go to New Jersey.

17) I am not a serial killer, thief, or rogue of any sort.

18) I will bring a travelling ""thing"" with me, which will be photographed in every place I visit and with every person who wishes to be in a picture with it. I'm open to suggestions.
