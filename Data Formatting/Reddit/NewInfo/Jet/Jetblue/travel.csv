I'm on a tight budget, so would love if you could help me out. My soon to be wife and I would like to take a honeymoon and go somewhere by the beach. We would like to book a hotel close to the beach, but haven't decided yet on the location. 

We plan to fly from Houston via spirit, jetblue,southwest, whichever one is cheaper to...well, that's the problem. At first we thought Fort Lauderdale, Miami, but I'm not sure if this is our best option. 
Can you suggest me some other beach/place where the above-mentioned airlines fly from Houston? And where we can get some affordable hotel close to the beach.


Thank you.
Dates of travel middle of August, staying for about a week.

My budget is 1000$ for flight plus hotel. 
I'm not a US citizen, so Mexico is out - i require a visa."

5,Really highly recommend not using Expedia.com for travel-- here is my terrible experience,0,7p1bqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7p1bqd/really_highly_recommend_not_using_expediacom_for/,25,2018-01-08 23:15:15,"First of all, be prepared any time you call their customer service line to be on the phone due to being on hold, being transferred to a different rep, ""my computer is being slow"", ""I'm just pulling up your profile"" etc for at least an hour and a half. I have called them about 6 times in the past month and have never spent less than 55 minutes, one call was more than two hours.


I booked a trip to Playa del Carmen to a resort with my boyfriend and bought trip insurance back in the fall from Jan 4 to 11 through Expedia. We broke up (lol) so I called to cancel the trip and was refunded and received airline credits. In order to go myself I had to call and rebook, which I did from Jan 4 to 8. 


Winter storm Grayson appeared on January 4 so I ended up just canceling the whole trip because my flight down to Cancun got canceled. I was told if I called Expedia before 11 am on January 4 to cancel the trip that I would receive a full refund from the hotel, so I called the night of January 3 to cancel the trip again.


This is where things go to shit. I spent two hours on the phone with a rep who supposedly canceled the trip for me. He was befuddled because he was asking me to check my email about getting a cancelation email and I never did. He finally ""manually"" sent one which is just some text and looked kind of sketchy. He also asked me to check my Expedia.com profile to make sure the trip said canceled. It never did but he didn't seem concerned. I never got another email about the cancelation and I kept checking my Expedia.com profile and the trip still said in progress. How odd, I thought...


Today, I kept getting emails from JetBlue about checking in for my flight. Checked my profile again and trip still said in progress. I called customer service again to make sure the trip was properly canceled. The woman I was on the phone with was getting increasingly annoyed at me because I kept saying please, can you resend the email about the flight credit, can you please resend the email about the trip cancelation, why does it say still in progress on my profile, etc. I'm glad I kept harping on her.


After 20 minutes of her saying ""I promise it is canceled!"" she realized that she was looking at the wrong trip. 


THEY HAD NEVER CANCELED THE SECOND TRIP AFTER I SPOKE WITH 4 CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. I'm now out $900 and a $200 flight credit. I'm a grad student. I don't have this kind of money to be throwing around on a trip I never went on. I'm about to have a panic attack because I'm still on hold to speak to her manager (and have been on hold for half an hour) and I don't think I""m going to get refunded.



I would HIGHLY recommend not using Expedia if there is any tiny chance at all that something is going to happen to your trip and you are going to have to contact customer service. I would never, ever want someone else to have to go through this ridiculous situation and I think it's truly not worth it. Next time I travel, I'd rather pay more to book through a better service or even the resort itself. 




EDIT: I GOT A FULL REFUND. I still think their customer service is atrocious and I had to spend an additional four hours on the phone but I did it. I just kept asking to speak to managers until I made it up to corporate, explained the situation, and had them pull the recording of the call. Was supposed to hear from them about it after 72 hours, didn't, called back and bitched my way up to corporate again. Once they listened to it they realized that I was right and their agent had screwed up!! Either that or they were sick of me calling. The people in corporate were way better to talk to though. All of them definitely had English as a first language so there was no chance of misunderstanding and they actually sounded like they genuinely felt bad about how dumb the situation was. But lesson learned!!!"

If I check us both into the airport on the day of the flight, will I just have an empty seat next to me, or is it possible that the seat will get filled with someone on standby?  

And when they see he wasn’t there for the first flight, will they automatically bump him off the return flight?

7,Items stolen from checked luggage which was searched by TSA.,2,68g14v,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/68g14v/items_stolen_from_checked_luggage_which_was/,23,2017-04-30 19:35:14,"I left St. Lucia yesterday afternoon with four bottles of rum packed in one of my bags. When I arrived home late last night I found only two bottles of rum in the bag and a notification from the TSA that my bag had been searched. We had to change plans at JFK on our way back to Boston, which is where the search must have taken place.

I have contacted JetBlue to alert them to the issue and ask for their assistance. I will also be filing a complaint with the TSA per the instructions on their website. Does anyone else who has had a similar experience have any further suggestions of action I could take?

I am beyond frustrated at this. I visited the island last year and brought home one bottle of a particular rum I liked. After finishing that bottle off I wished I had bought more. This time down I bought two bottles of that same rum and found two other types I liked of which I bought one bottle each. They are all St. Lucian rums and are not available anywhere near NH. One of the rums stolen was only available at the distillery which I visited during the vacation.

It's not the money involved as it's only about $80 worth of rum, but the fact that these were my souvenirs which I intended to enjoy for months to come as a reminder of my trip to the island were stolen from me in such a blatant manner. I entrusted my bags to JetBlue and the TSA only to have this happen. Now I'm just getting ready for each to say the other could have been at fault and both deny any responsibility. Even if the TSA does admit fault, I don't want the money...I want the damn rum I purchased!

I couldn't take these items in my carry-on luggage like I do with all other valuable items since that amount of liquids cannot go through security.

I can't get over that they would search my bag, take two bottles of rum and then leave the notice indicating the bag was searched. It's essentially leaving a business card at the scene of the a crime you just committed.

Maybe I should just be happy they didn't take all of the rum and were nice enough to leave me two of the bottles.

So if anyone who has had a similar experience and has advice to lend (beyond contacting JetBlue and filing a complaint with the TSA) it would be very appreciated.

I've never traveled anywhere via plane, nor I have I gone on a trip alone. So, doing both the for the first time, at the same time, is a little more than intimidating.  
I have checked out the ITA matrix and I probably know where I'll be buying my ticket from there.  
I just saw that there is now a link to the beginners guide to airports, and I will be checking that soon. (It wasn't a link when I checked it a few weeks ago.)  
  
SO! My main question is:  
Are there any airlines I should avoid?  
I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?  
  
Any other tips that the beginners guide may not tell me?  
  
Any scams I should avoid? ie. ""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""  
  
I'll add more questions later, in the meantime any other advice you can give me from what I stated would be appreciated. If you have any questions for me I will answer them as soon as possible.  "

What is your experience in ensuring you sit with your spouse/partner/friend on a JetBlue coach flight without having to pay fees?

I flew from San Francisco to NYC on on December 18th which is when I made the baggage claim. They haven’t located my bag so I had to fill out papers with information on my lost luggage. The second page asked for a list of items in my luggage and their receipts. They were all old clothing that I don’t have proof of purchase anymore or the memory of where I bought them. The only articles of clothing I have a receipt of were a air of pants and a sweater from Banana Republic that I had purchased before flying. The only other receipts I had were for my electronics which included a PS4 and a headset as well as three games. So I wrote those down. 

They call me today to tell me that they only compensate for essentials and not electronics so I explained that I have no other receipts and was told that I still had to write the items with the date of purchase and price. When I asked what I should do if I don’t know either of those things, the dude just repeated the thing instead of answering my question. 

They also said that they’d reimburse me for items that I needed to buy due to my lost luggage but only if I bought them within five days after the claim in made. I was way past the five day mark so I can’t even get reimbursement for the new clothing I had to buy. 

So all in all, I have nothing to show to get any reimbursement and I don’t know what to do. I’m a college student with a minimum wage job. I don’t have the money to replace all my lost items. And some were hand made. I don’t know what to do at this point.

* No refunds or changes

How do airlines like United Airlines, AA, JetBlue etc. prevent you from going on board with a carry-on bag + personal item?"

She is having some nervousness about the flights, and I'm hoping to find some information for her to help calm her nerves.  I've never flown internationally, and I am finding my google-vue is not strong.  

Details:
Flying MCO to LAX 5/21; landing 9:33PM (Jetblue); 3.32 layover

LAX to PVG 1:05am-6am (China Eastern); 4.05 layover

PVG to OkA 10:05am-1:30pm (China Eastern) 


Return 3/31
OKA to PVG, arrival 3:55pm (CE); 5.05 layover

PVG to LAX 9pm-6pm (CE); 3.57 layover

LAX-MCO 9:57pm departure

Ok, a few questions.
1.  Will those layover times be enough for whatever she has to do at each stop?  

2.  She knows she has to collect her bag in LAX both ways, and recheck it.  Does she have to collect her bag in PVG either way or does it get checked all the way through because it's on the same airline?

3.  What does she do when she arrives at PVG?  Does she go through customs and immigration, even if she is never leaving the airport, and just going from one plane to another?  How does that work?

4.  Are there signs in English at PVG?  

Thanks so much for the help. I'm not sure what else I can ask to help her out, so if you have anything else you can share, please feel free to do so!

Yesterday I was looking for flights back home to Boston from DC for next week. I found several on JetBlue for $69, one flight leaving every hour or two. They weren't flagged as having only a few seats left, as some flights on other airlines were. Once I confirmed with the rest of my party that this arrangement worked, I went to buy the tickets, but now they're $166, and have been since last night. It's showing the same price and same flights on every aggregator site as well as on the JetBlue site.

What exactly happened here? Did they just happen to raise the price? Do they sell a certain number of $69 seats and then the rest are full price? I'm assuming I'm SOL and will be paying $166, but just wanting to know how JetBlue pricing works for future reference."

I'm heading to Chile in a few months after finding a killer deal on flights to visit a friend on study abroad and to explore the country! It's my first *international* trip alone, and I've been doing a lot of research (because that's honestly part of the fun). Here's the itinerary I've come up with for now, leaving on August 24 and returning on September 4.

* August 25- CHS-FLL; JetBlue, arriving around 3PM. Travel to Miami airport on TriRail, check in around 6PM for an 8:30PM flight on LATAM to Santiago.
* August 26- Arrive in Santiago around 6AM. Meet up with my friend, check into hostel, explore the city (I've got a list of museums/neighborhoods/parks/etc that I want to see, but I'm open to suggestions!).
* August 27- Santiago.
* August 28- Santiago. Grab a late afternoon flight or overnight bus to La Serena.
* August 29- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory).
* August 30- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory). Overnight bus to Santiago.
* August 31- Arrive in Santiago early in the morning, grab a bus to Valpariso.
* September 1- Valpariso.
* September 2- Morning bus to Santiago.
* September 3- Santiago.
* September 4- Santiago, 2:30PM LATAM flight SCL-ASU-GRU-MIA (somehow, it was significantly cheaper this way).
* September 5- Arrive in Miami around 6:30AM. Need to be at FLL for a 6:30 JetBlue flight back to Charleston. Might be meeting a friend for part of the day, but I'm also interested in suggestions for a few hours in Miami.

I'm a 19 y/o guy, and outside of the flights (around $600, already paid), I'm budgeting around $600 for all else. I can increase that, but I'd really prefer not to.

I need to be in Santiago on both weekends so I can meet up with my friend and I'm dead set on seeing Valpariso, but I'm not sure if La Serena is worth the trip. I'm guessing heading south will be too cold in late August/early September, and I visited Death Valley in March and it seems pretty similar to the Atacama. What would you do if you were me, especially regarding the time I'm currently thinking about spending in La Serena?"

We specifically booked an evening flight on a smaller plane to not have to fly early in the morning, but that's fine I guess.  Problem is, we booked our hotel through them from jet blue vacations.  So now they leave us on a Friday night in new orleans with no place to stay and hotel prices at last minute, weekend, nosebleed rates when we specifically planned our vacation to avoid weekend flights and hotel rates.  After 3 hrs on the phone with customer service  (which was of no help at all) the lady at the airport was the only one who was helpful and we were able to arrange with our previous hotel a new room, luckily despite already being checked out.  Now as we are finally flying back after having to pay for another night ourselves which we didn't want, on a weekend which we didn't want, on a morning flight which we didn't want, they throw us in the back of a packed plane in seats we had no opportunity to pick ourselves despite our previous flight plan, that have fallen apart and aren't even attached to the frame, which I'm sure is an faa violation of some kind, with a tv that doesn't work. I am a true blue member and take all my flights and vacations through jetblue  I am incredibly disgusted by the level of service they have provided when they have been generally known for your customer service exceeding the other airlines.  We have been accommodated by other airlines for mistakes and cancelations in other countries for a lot less. The response I have gotten from them has been multiple people saying, sorry I can't do anything, which I know is false to begin with. This is not how you win market share over competitors.  I hope other people see this post and see the blatant disregard so they can save themselves the future hassle.   As for me, I will do so in the future by flying delta. This is unacceptable.

For some reason she thought their flight to Orlando left from Boston around 8PM. I think she somehow mixed up this flight for a different one they had booked for my brother a few weeks before. They got to Logan really early, sometime between 4PM and 5PM, and when she pulled up their booking she realized their flight was actually from Hartford at around 6PM. It was too late at that point to make it to Hartford for that flight. They spoke to a woman at the JetBlue counter who was able to put them on a flight from Boston to Ft Lauderdale departing at 9:15PM, which they’re on right now as I’m writing this. They’ll have to drive a little further to get to where they’re staying, but I’m thinking that’s a small price to pay for a mistake like this. The agent had also put them on standby for an earlier flight to Orlando, their original destination, but there ended up being no room, so they took that later flight to FLL. JetBlue also re-booked the return flight into Boston as well.

I’m basically just wondering if this is standard procedure for airlines to do something like this? When she had first called me and was explaining what happened, my first thought was they were out all of the money for their original flight and return. I was pleasantly surprised to here otherwise. I’m not sure if they just got lucky, but either way, good on JetBlue for bailing them out.

Since I was basically a first time flyer I was super meticulous with the bag sizes and liquids. We flew JetBlue Economy and I ended up having to pay for one checked bag. But a couple weeks before we left I went out and got new luggage and mini backpacks to use as myself and my daughters carry on and personal bags. They weren't expensive, but I spent like $60 with the mind set that buying new luggage in the smaller, correct sizes will prevent a SECOND $60 checked bag fee each way.I had a cute, brand new book bag that was going to be my daughter's personal bag, but because the measurements of the bag went just over the stated limit on the website, I didn't take it.

So we get to the airport and meet my sister in law, and she also has one daughter, and they both have these big backpacks and rolling luggage about the same size as our rolling carry ons. I was like, aren't your bags going to be too big to be a personal item?! She was like, No! I hope not. They had just traveled to CA and back so I trusted her, and she was right.

It seemed to me neither airport, BWI or MCO, cared much about the size of the carry on and personal bags, as long as they fit where they were supposed to.

I booked through one of the websites on momondo before on a similar route and I had to pay baggage fees for Jet blue and then pick up my bags at ewr and then pay again. I very much want to avoid this, as well as my Jetblue flight getting delayed and then missing my flight out of the U.S."

And if so, at what points does the cost vs. miles savings not become realistic?

My flight will be from NYC to Portland, or possibly to Chicago (or both through the year) and it looks like the cheapest flights (or the ones with the fewest connections) are JetBlue and Delta (I think) but I might be able to pick up a United (where my miles are) flight for $50 more, or even $100 more, but will likely also extend my travel time and have a connection.

At what point is it not worth it? Is there a formula? Rule of thumb?

63,PSA about Southwest's International Service in Emergencies,0,6yum72,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6yum72/psa_about_southwests_international_service_in/,6,2017-09-08 17:02:56,"As someone who flies a lot for work and typically flies Southwest, I was really excited to see them add international offerings and recently flew to Punta Cana for a short vacation. The first day we landed, Irma started to form so I contacted Southwest twice about moving my flight up so we could leave in advance of it getting near the Dominican Republic. We ended up booking a second earlier flight that would get us out of the country in advance of Irma reaching the DR.

Southwest ended up cancelling all service in and out of Punta Cana in the days leading up to Irma (I understand the safety argument, but the weather was fine there until the day of the hurricane and every other carrier flew in and out of the airport with the exception of  Thursday).

I called and was told there was nothing they could do as they only have one flight a day and they would be unable to put us on any other airline as they do not have agreements with them. We were told to ride out the hurricane and that they could get us on a flight in the days after it had passed.

Thankfully we were able to book on a separate airline, but Southwest has been totally unwilling to take any responsibility for the few hundred people they stranded there in the days leading up to the hurricane.  

It has been really frustrating especially after seeing some of the stories about Delta and Jetblue supporting their customers and I just wanted to make sure people were aware of the risks prior to booking with them (especially internationally).

TLDR: Southwest does not have the quantity of planes, infrastructure, or partner airlines to get you out of these international locations in the event of emergencies. Tread carefully before booking any of these flights since they have continually hid behind contract of carriage and refused to refund any of the expenses we had to fly out on a different airline.

A day before the trip, my boss tells me that the trip is cancelled. So I end up having to expense my card, because the flight was non-refundable. The company pays for it and all is square.

Almost a year later (now), I get a random email from our company’s outsourced travel agency, saying that I have not used this ticket and that it will officially expire this December.

My question is now: (1) Will JetBlue allow me to use this credit towards the purchase of another airline ticket to somewhere else? (2) Is it likely that my purchasing a personal ticket will alert anyone from my company? (3) Will JetBlue allow me to buy my ticket with this credit along with a ticket for a friend as well?

The first leg of the flight was with Aer Lingus and the 2nd leg into FLL was with Jetblue.  Upon realizing in FLL that his luggage was missing he filled out a report.  The only thing that has been determined since (now in the 4th day) is that the luggage never made it to Boston.  We receive no calls from either airline and when we call them, Aer Lingus says that its up to Jet Blue to get him his luggage, as he filed the report with them and Jet Blue says they never received it but are looking into it.

Needless to say it's a major bummer but that aside is there something more we can be doing?  Is it true that JetBlue have the liability in this scenario?  Does anyone/airline insider knows what happens with lost luggage? is there a central depository where lost luggage would end up by region or airline?

It's my first *international* trip alone, and I've been doing a lot of research (because that's honestly part of the fun). Here's the itinerary I've come up with for now, leaving on August 24 and returning on September 4.

* August 25- CHS-FLL; JetBlue, arriving around 3PM. Travel to Miami airport on TriRail, check in around 6PM for an 8:30PM flight on LATAM to Santiago.
* August 26- Arrive in Santiago around 6AM. Meet up with my friend, check into hostel, explore the city (I've got a list of museums/neighborhoods/parks/etc that I want to see, but I'm open to suggestions!).
* August 27- Santiago.
* August 28- Santiago. Grab a late afternoon flight or overnight bus to La Serena.
* August 29- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory).
* August 30- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory). Overnight bus to Santiago.
* August 31- Arrive in Santiago early in the morning, grab a bus to Valpariso.
* September 1- Valpariso.
* September 2- Morning bus to Santiago.
* September 3- Santiago.
* September 4- Santiago, 2:30PM LATAM flight SCL-ASU-GRU-MIA (somehow, it was significantly cheaper this way).
* September 5- Arrive in Miami around 6:30AM. Need to be at FLL for a 6:30 JetBlue flight back to Charleston. Might be meeting a friend for part of the day, but I'm also interested in suggestions for a few hours in Miami.

I'm a 19 y/o guy, and outside of the flights (around $600, already paid), I'm budgeting around $600 for all else. I can increase that, but I'd really prefer not to.

I need to be in Santiago on both weekends so I can meet up with my friend and I'm dead set on seeing Valpariso, but I'm not sure if La Serena is worth the trip. I'm guessing heading south will be too cold in late August/early September, and I visited Death Valley in March and it seems pretty similar to the Atacama. What would you do if you were me, especially regarding the time I'm currently thinking about spending in La Serena?"

**Saturday**

Flew JetBlue from New York to Cancun because we got a good deal. Flight was delayed a few hours, but we got some travel credits, which was much appreciated. The original plan was to pick up a rental car from Hertz at the airport, but due to the flight delay, they were closed when we arrived. However we reserved the car through AmEx, and they helped move the reservation to pickup the next day. So when we landed, we went straight to the hotel through a cab at the airport. We chose the official partner (maybe SuperShuttle? Forgot to document this). The ride seemed expensive for what it was, but was ultimately fine.

We wanted to stay somewhere easy to get to, efficient, clean, and downtown/not in the hotel district, and chose Suites Malecon Cancun. This was a BIG MISTAKE. When we arrived and went into our room, whoever was there previously had smoked in the bathroom and it smelled horribly. Tried to steam/air it out, but only succeeded a little bit. There were stains on the bedspread and lampshade. The air conditioner was difficult to figure out, and ultimately made the room pretty cold. But all this could have been forgiven if the room had sufficient soundproofing. My guess is that the hotel was built in a hurry, and they did a shoddy job. Even though we were on the 14th floor, with the windows closed, metal window gates closed and A/C running, we could still hear the bars across the street. Even worse, there was some kind of fun run event that started before dawn across the street that featured loudspeakers blasting music to get the runners motivated. We could also hear other guests in their rooms talking and when they dropped things on the floor. It was very frustrating not to get any sleep after the delayed flight.


**Sunday**

The next annoying hurdle was Hertz. Even though we reserved a car online, they said since we didn't pre-pay, they didn't have to honor the reservation for the car we wanted. All they had available was a Dodge Grand Caravan. It was much bigger than we needed, and ended up costing us more in gas than a regular car would have. But it drove nicely, and the A/C worked well.

The drive to Merida was mostly uneventful. Took the tollway most of the trip, which was fast and had no traffic. Got stopped on the Yucatan/Quintana Roo border by a federale. He let us go through without hassle (queue foreshadowing music). Stayed in Koox Art 64 Boutique Hotel in El Centro. Generally a nice place with very helpful employees and lovely pool. Room had good A/C, huge TV, cute patio, large closet, safe, comfortable/pillows, and ceiling fan. Downsides were that there was no bathroom door, not great soundproofing (birds, neighboring children), no fridge in room, and it seemed relatively easy for bugs to get in. The room was upstairs, and there was a shared kitchen and living room downstairs.

Checked out Merida en Domingo that day, which was really fun. Traditional dancing, tons of vendors and people around. Had a sopa de lima snack from one of the stands, which was kind of weak. Went for lunch to Manjar Blanco. Very tasty. Tried panuchos, papadzules, and relleno negro. Rest of the day was spent walking around, swimming and checking out thing around town.

For dinner, went to Tikin Xic on the north side of town. Food was good, cheap, and the staff was nice. Great botanas and ceviche. The namesake dish was good too. After, checked out the funk/blues jam at Dzalbay. It was decently fun.

I guess it's at this point that I'll also mention something that seems pretty obvious, and it's that Merida is HOT. Even in February, it was 90s during the day. And a lot of places don't have A/C, probably because most people are used to it.


**Monday**

Lots more walking around and city exploring. Had some breakfast tacos at Taqueria La Lupita. They were excellent. Amazing Cochinita and lechon. So much flavor and fantastic texture.

It's cool that Merida had kind of a heyday in the mid 1800s. Paseo de Montejo has a lot of beautiful, ornate old buildings that look like they should be an embassy or something. Checked out some of the large markets as well, at people's recommendations here. Had a hard time figuring out where the ""best"" places were. The hawkers were kind of aggressive and I wasn't ready for it. Ending up having some Poc Chuc, which was okay but left me wanting. Walked around some more and had some tepache and ice cream, both of which were fine but nothing special.

Walked around more, swam more to beat the heat and rested at the hotel. Had some fish tacos at El Fabuloso Pez. Nice presentation, though the place seemed pretty corporate/cookie cutter. Got a little bit sick from the food. Went to Golden Island Casino after, which was disappointing, as it was almost entirely video slots. 

Took an Uber back to Centro and went to Pipiripau for a drink and it was totally dead. Then went to La Negrita. Bands were playing, people dancing, super fun scene. Had some ceviche, which was uninspiring, but didn't matter. Negrita was great.


**Tuesday**

Day trip to Uxmal for ruins. Walked around a bunch. Lots of tourists around obviously, but it was cool. Didn't pay for a guide or tour or anything. Just wandered. Saw some lizards get into an intense fight. Left to go to Hacienda Mucuyche for lunch and the cenote. Lunch was fine, nothing special. Had some salbutes, chips, water and other snacks. The cenote was done as part of a tour group. Kind of felt Disney-ified, but was super beautiful. Wish we had longer to swim around. Went to cenote Kankirixche after, which was also pretty, but the opposite experience. Instead of a guided tour and guides and stuff, you just gave the guy $30MX for a little laminated card. Then you give the card to the guy by the cenote and he just lets you do your thing. Very different experiences, both fun.

Got stopped again by federales getting back into Yucatan. They seemed perplexed that I didn't speak Spanish and let me go. Had reservations at Nectar for dinner, but wife got super sick either from lunch or accidentally drinking cenote water or something. Had to cancel the reservation. People at the hotel suggested Uber Eats for delivery, and figured why not. Wanted to see what the burrito was like, and ordered one from La Taque. It came on a paper tray, wrapped in plastic, which was weird, but was very tasty. And huge! No rice either, just meat and cheese wrapped up and grilled a bit.


**Wednesday**

Woke up for a taco brunch. Walked to Taqueria Yucatan. Good tacos! Great tortillas! Nice service even though they didn't speak any English, and my Spanish is very limited. The chaya con huevos was excellent. Checked out of hotel and drove to Wayan'e for more tacos. Loved the variety and amazing flavors. I'd read about green chorizo but never eaten it before. Really delicious. Didn't love that they charged me for 6 tacos and only gave me 5, and that the prices on the receipt didn't match the menu. But the food was great, so I wasn't complaining.

Started the drive out of Merida to El Cuyo for some beach time. Stopped by Federales, because of course. I booked with Mattias through VRBO, emailed back and forth a few times to confirm details, including within a week of our scheduled arrival, and everything seemed like it was going to be setup for a nice stay.

Got into El Cuyo, located the Hacienda, knocked on the door, and another guest let us in. They told me I should message Mattias or his assistant Magally via WhatsApp for the keys. So I messaged Magally and she told me that there were no rooms available. I sent her a photo of my confirmation, but she was not apologetic and offered no alternatives. VRBO had only one other place in El Cuyo, Cabanas El Cuyo. It was super bare bones. Wood plank room, bad lighting, sub par bed & pillows, no A/C, bad water pressure, luke warm shower. If there were neighbors, I would have heard everything the did. But Reyes, the guy running it, was nice enough. And it was right on the beach, so the breeze was great and the view was incredible.

Unfortunately, Reyes also suggested getting dinner at Loncheria La Lupita. Got some tacos, gringas and salbutes. I say unfortunately, because maybe it wasn't the cleanest place, because I got really sick from the food. Had a rough night.


**Thursday**

Didn't sleep much that night. Decided that it would be nicer outside than inside and rolled around on a lounger for a few hours. Had some water. Ventured into town for some pancakes at Naia Cafe. Right on cue, more Federales show up. These ones were very interested in me and my passport. Took one of the other diner's passports and didn't seem to give it back. Pancakes were mediocre. Could have used some baking soda. Hung out more on the beach. Weather was mid 80s and beautiful. Maybe only two other people within sight on the beach. Totally chill.

Originally had an idea to get dinner in Tizimin, but after seeing the roads and lack of lighting, changed plans. Got dinner that night at Chile Gordo. It's run by a nice British woman and very cute. Food is central Mexican/Veracruz in style and good. Walked around El Cuyo some more. Kids were preparing for Carnival the next week. Watched them a bit. Star gazed. Had some night beach. Cooled off at night to upper 70s.


**Friday**

Packed up and left El Cuyo. Drove through Yucatan. Got stopped by Federales once again. This guy kept saying there was something wrong with license plates of the rental van. Wouldn't let us go. He said we had to go to Merida for some kind of inspection and similar nonsense. We said we could not do that. Eventually he asked for a bribe. Being that we had to catch a flight, ended up paying and then leaving. He said be careful.

Filled up the van, took it back to Hertz. Still waiting to see if they charge anything extra for damage that doesn't exist. Flight home was thankfully uneventful other than that the Direct TV/movies didn't work.

Our connecting flight was delayed and arrived just in time for jetblue to close the gate early and force us to reschedule on the next flight 2 1/2 hours later.  We all scheduled our flight so that we would arrive back in Boston in time for work. Now we have had to reschedule 3 meetings and burn 2 more hours of vacation time. I spoke with a gate agent and simply asked for some simple food vouchers so that we could get some breakfast while we waited.  She shunned me off with a sly smile telling me she was waiting on a supervisor.  I then went to the Jetblue help desk and finally got a supervisor on my own.  She then told me there was nothing she could do and that I should call the 1-800 number and speak to a customer service rep.  At this point I was more irritated by the lack of respect so I called a customer service rep named Amber who then proceeded to tell me that I would have to file a complaint through their ""speak up"" button on the website and that she could provide no help.  I clicked on the speak up button and went to the compensation section only to find that the button to choose departure dates is a 'javascript(0);' call.  In other words, it does nothing.

As far as I can tell Jetblue's policy is to give us vouchers worth $25 for future travel on their airline.  Given their absolute lack of respect for their own motto, I would prefer to not get compensated with something that just gives them more money. 

Any advice on what you guys think I should do, or have any of you run into a level of customer service incompetence of this caliber?"

I simultaneously searched other websites for the same package. I saw that JetBlue had the same exact package (same flights, same hotel, same hotel room, same dates) for about $80 cheaper. Having used Expedia many times in the past for flights, and being aware of their [best price guarantee](http://www.expedia.com/p/info-other/guarantees.htm), which promises to credit or refund the difference in price and provide a $50 coupon for a future booking, I figured I would go ahead and book with Expedia. I was a loyal customer, could get some rewards points, and essentially pay ~$130 less.
 
 
 
After booking, I refreshed JetBlue and saw the same package was still available, again for about $80 cheaper. I immediately submit the online application for their Best Price Guarantee, and attach the screenshots as requested. 36 hours later, I receive a confirmation that my application was received. Almost 2 full days after I submitted my application, I received a response that I was denied.

 A few issues. 

* They essentially checked 48 hours for an identical package with a cheaper price. Naturally, with the time that elapsed, packages will either sell out or go up in price.

* The claim that the hotel had no rooms available was false. I went back to JetBlue and ran 2 searches. If I searched for just the hotel, then there are no availabilities. If I searched for the package (flight + hotel), then the hotel is available.

* What also hurt my case was that their email is in a different time zone (or something). I contacted them ~1/04/15 2:52 AM, but their email confirming receipt of my application shows that I submitted it on Jan 5, 2015 11:54:50 AM. They could not understand this discrepancy when I brought it up.
 
 
 
I called the number they provided. I explained what I typed just above. They basically kept saying there was nothing they could do since it was determined that my claim was denied.
 
 
 
I emailed again, with additional screenshots depicting that rooms were still available. By this time, rooms with the view that I booked were sold out, but other rooms were still available. And, naturally, flight prices continued to rise. So, while I was not able to reproduce the package several days later, I will still able to address the 2 reasons they gave for declining my claim:

* package was available for a lower rate at the time of contact (evidenced by screenshot)

* rooms were available
 
 
 
Many emails later with attempts to use logic, they still declined my claim. I provided a PDF printout of the *initial* cheaper package as further proof (PDF was not an accepted format on the online application). I admitted I could not provide the same package at a lower price during each email exchange, but that is simply because prices rise with time, and rooms/tickets sell out. I asked what the point of a screenshot is if they will disregard it, and they basically cited the same reasons, but added:
 
 
> We do empathize with your situation and wish we were in a position to do more, however, we need to comply with the rules and restrictions of your reservation.
 
 
 
I called one last time today, asking about the cancellation policy since I had purchased insurance, and when I requested at least a travel voucher, the agent was able to give me a $50 one.
 
 
 
**TL;DR** - booked with expedia based on ""Best Price Guarantee"". I met all requirements and provided proof. They checked ~48 hours later, after prices rose and rooms sold out, and deemed that they could not determine the lower-priced package was available at a lower rate when I first contacted them. "

Ingoing Jetblue has the perfect time for me (and nonstop) but going back isn't the best on the return. Delta had better times on the return.

Using Google flights - it seems like I can get each for seperate for the same price as round trip using just 1 (400 using Jetblue or delta, or 200 there using Jetblue 200 back using Delta).

Is there totally acceptable practice? Is there anything I'm missing? Since it's the same price I was hoping it wouldn't be dumb to do that since it would be best catering to better times for flights.

Yesterday, I read about the JetBlue $64 roundtrip sale that was happening between NYC and tons of major cities around the country. Impulsively, I bought two trips. While checking out, I read fine print that said all flights were refundable within 24 hours of purchase, provided the trip was at least seven days out (mine were). I planned to spend last night thinking it over/researching, then decide which flight I wanted to keep and cancel the other today.

However, I just got off the phone with a JB agent who said, ""Fun fact, you actually can't cancel these sales. The fine FINE print says these tickets are nonrefundable/transferable. Shoulda read closer, joke's on you, etc.""

I hate to think there's nothing I can do in this situation, and that I'm just gonna be out $140 (though I'm aware that I'm probably just SOL on this one). Does anyone know of any loopholes to cancel on flash sale promotions similar to this one?

[UPDATE]: Thanks to /u/boobsaredopes advice, I emailed JetBlue telling them it was illegal not to let any passenger cancel any flight within 24 hours of booking...and they were immediately like, ""Oh, no, we're so sorry -- you actually CAN cancel your flight."" So...yeah. Crisis averted."

119,Question for connecting flights from JetBlue airlines to sata airlines,2,6esaaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6esaaq/question_for_connecting_flights_from_jetblue/,1,2017-06-02 08:44:15,"I'm heading to Barcelona tomorrow via JetBlue and Sata and I'm curious how customs/checking will work between the two airlines (as they're partners). I'm taking JetBlue out of BWI to Boston at 5:55pm and then have an hour and a half layover until the sata flight to Barcelona. When I check in at BWI, will they give me the boarding passes for both flights or only for the one to Boston? I would like to know this because I assume I would have to go through security again if I don't get both tickets. Going through security and customs would be pushing the time limit of my layover. This was set up through the airlines (I didn't set up the connecting flights myself) so I'm guessing I'll be alright but I just wanted to make sure. Any advice would be much appreciated! Also I'm planning on bringing a bag that's about 5cm over the depth size limit, are airlines typically strict about enforcing this rule? I'm new to travelling and plan on doing a lot more in the future so again, I welcome any advice/tips about travelling in Barcelona you might have. Thanks in advance!"
120,JetBlue is not storing passwords are not stored correctly,1,13yj85,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13yj85/jetblue_is_not_storing_passwords_are_not_stored/,1,2012-11-29 01:34:51,"Just sent this to JetBlues it team.

You are not storing your passwords properly. I recently had a bag that did not make it to my stop. The jetblue lady signed me up for Travel Bank. I was shocked when I was sent login info of my current jetblue username and password. This shows me that my data is not safe with jetblue. If you are hashing passwords like you should you are unable to reverse the password back to plain text. The correct way to store passwords would be to take the users password, add a salt to it (this would be a random sting added to the end of the users pass), hash (this is a no reversible encryption) then store this in your data base. When the user goes to login the server takes the password and adds the salt to it then checks this off the data base. A better way to do this is to assign a random salt to each user in the database. then do the same as above but grab the salt from the database. This needs to be fixed ASAP as its a huge venerability to users security. If you have any questions please contact me.

The resort is beautiful, the service is downright AWFUL!  I traveled with a family of four after booking a 2 queen room. We got there and they only had a king bed room for us.  When we pressed for what we reserved and paid for we were told ""The reservation is merely a suggestion"".  I thought I was in a Seinfeld episode.  Literally hours of negotiation and MANY escalations to the next higher up manager led to us getting a room like we reserved, but we had to switch rooms during the visit.  Atlantis thought it was ok to ask me to check out of one room by 11, take my bags to the bell desk, have no room until 3 or 4 and check in again.  I raised a stink and we got to stay in the one room until the other was ready.  Stupid.  Lots of other really poor service with no apologies or empathy.  Then they tried to charge us again for the rooms we already paid for.  I spent more time at the front desk than in the water.

So here is the kicker.  I've been trying to get my stay credited to my Jet Blue rewards account.  The live chat was so unbelievable that I've copied it here (I am ""You"" and the Atlantis rep is ""Christopher"".  He still thinks I am calling him about my JetBlue flights. . .

You: Christopher I want to get points for a recent stay rewarded and transferred to my JetBlue account

Christopher Says: We are unable to access Jetblue systems here. You would need to contact them directly.

Christopher Says: You are referring to flights you purchased directly through us correct?

You: They said the transfer of points for my Atlantis stay had to be initiatied by atlantis

You: No, points for my Atlantis stay to be credited to my JetBlue account

You: both sites say you are partners

Christopher Says: We have no access to Jetblue systems and can not apply or transfer points. We are able to book flights like any other 3rd party site but do not have direct access to any Jetblue systems.

You: whatever, Atlantis is one truly incompetent outfit. All hotels give reward points and allow you to transfer to airline partners. Both your website and JetBlue's indicates such for Atlantis. I shouldn't be surpirsed, the service on my stay was awful as well. You'd think given how much you charge that it would be better. . .

Christopher Says: I apologize you feel this way. We book flights for our guest as a courtesy. Our website does not mention that we are partners with Jetblue in anyway. We have only have access to book flights here at Atlantis and do not have access to manage any airlines point system.

Christopher Says: You must contact the airline directly for this.

You: From your website ""A TrueBlue Member will receive 1 TrueBlue Point for each $1US spent on room stays in Atlantis, Paradise Island, Bahamas.""

You: They need you to tell them how much I spent

You: Here is the page if you doubt me

You: http://www.atlantis.com/aboutatlantis/atlantispartners.aspx

If you are booking with any of those airlines, make sure you check it out. 

Anecdotal story: I booked a ticket on Alaska for an upcoming birthday trip. It was about $100 more than the other direct option (United) and $200 more than the cheapest fare (Delta, not direct), but I prefer Alaska and wanted the miles so I was willing to pay more. Since booking the ticket, I've checked fares every few weeks, and it has now dropped by over $200. I just claimed the price difference on their website (they've made it very easy to do) and now have a $209 credit to use against another flight within the next year. It certainly takes the stress away of trying to figure out when the best time to book a flight is in order to get the best price."
