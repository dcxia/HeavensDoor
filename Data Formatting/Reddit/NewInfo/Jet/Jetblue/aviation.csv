I have applied to the Gateway Select program for JetBlue and have been selected to take their assessment. This is directed to those that have completed the program, are in the program currently, or have taken the test itself.  What exactly can I expect from the assessment?  Is it more aviation related or is it more general education related (like ACT/SAT.) I have done a lot of research on the program itself and for me the costs are not going to be (that) much of an issue. But I want to ensure that I do well on this assessment.  If anyone has any information for me (or even some practice tests that I could take) that would be absolutely fantastic and very much appreciated!  Thank you so much in advance.  
\*I will be checking regularly and responding to comments quickly\*

5,Jetblue gateway select program details,3,75iu0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/75iu0s/jetblue_gateway_select_program_details/,39,2017-10-10 21:56:51,"This post will detail my experience with the application process (and hopefully even further).

Found out about gateway select earlier this year, couldn't find much info on the process as I researched (found two helpful posts on r/flightsim and r/flying). Obvi it started in 2016 so there isn't much info to be found other then what's on the web page (http://pilots.jetblue.com/gateway-select/training). 

Submitted my application, resume, and cover letter Sept 24 2017.
Received an email on Oct 4 stating I've been selected for the next round of the application process.
This involved signing up for a $160 aptitude test at a testing center and to have the test completed by Oct 15. Just returned from that test and decided to make this post as I went in to it blind. You've got three hours and 4 test segments:

1. Multitasking: watch and interact with a flight sim, with limited direction on what the test comprises of. Keep track of audio directions (and how many individuals give you those directions), keep track of how many times there is a chiming noise, keep track of how many times a red light turns on. You also will have to click a button everytime you see air traffic or pass over a waypoint (you will be asked at what point you saw the helicopters and what the last way point looked like). While all this is happening you use the up and down arrows in a mini-game where you navigate a plane past oncoming rectangles. AND you have a few seconds to assess and answer quick math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition questions. The Sim ends and you answer the questions about how many chimes and how many people, what the last check point looked like, how many aircraft you saw, where in the route was the airfield, what the cockpit looked like and where the guages were. You make an assesment of how hard all that was and rate yourself on how well you did. Then you do the sim again. Slightly different, except this time you know what you're looking for.

2. Math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition:
Worst math was an algebra question (something like, (y-12)÷14=9). Spacial reasoning and pattern recognition are timed events, gotta be quick to answer or it counts as wrong.

3. Reacting to confrontation:
Questions like ""you see a couple arguing, the woman is trying to get away but the man has a hold of her arm and keeps pulling her back. Do you A B C or D?"" All the questions were how you'd react in a confrontation either involving you or getting involved with others.

4. Personality test:
Basic personality test. Questions like ""I work well with others."" ""Individual performance is more important then group success."" Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree.

The test results come back same day via email.

Next up will be a phone interview if they like the test results.
After that is an in person interview.

Will post as I move thru the process. 
This is an informative post about the process; discussions on program details and cost exist on other threads. Have not seen anything detailing NDA on what the test is made of. Dm me if this violates any policy that may jepordise my applicant eligibility.

(Fist post on Reddit, ever. Plz dm any tips/criticisms/correct place to post)

I've always wanted to try out jetBlue's Mint service since I've heard and seen so much about it, but I never had the opportunity to do so until now. I will be traveling cross-country for business in June, and have the option of starting from JFK or from LAX. The problem is that I can only afford to fly Mint on one leg of the journey. Hence, my dilemma.

That is why I ask: all else being equal, which experience would be better: flying jetBlue Mint from JFK to LAX, or from LAX to JFK?


_Updated to add:_ I did it! And you were absolutely right; JFK-LAX on Mint was worth it. The service was very very nice. I am going to be flying Mint on that route from here on out, if I can afford to.

So I'm assuming that the ramps at JFK, LGA, EWR, PHL, IAD, BWI, DCA, BDL, BOS and more are completely empty. That's got to be hundreds of planes. Where did they all go? Is there some ramp at ORD packed with United and American planes? Is CLT jammed up?

Anyone got pics?

I had a very unusual experience last month flying Alaska Airlines, and my girlfriend had the same experience with JetBlue today.

So we were flying from BOS -> SJC on Alaska, on an A320-200 on a very very cold Sunday evening. We were told that we had a totally full flight and that due to the weight, cold temperatures, and high winds, we needed to stop in Detroit to refuel the plane. We ended up getting canceled, sleeping in the terminal, and taking a Delta flight back. Alaska compensated us nicely but still...this is a new one for me - I've flown many transcontinental trips over the last ten years and haven't had the unplanned stop experience. 

Just today, my girlfriend is flying back from JFK -> SJC on JetBlue, on an A320-200, and had a similar experience, she was told due to high winds. Her flight has to stop in PHX to refuel. 

I was under the impression that for the A320ceo, a transcontinental hop was well within its operating range of 3200 miles. I've never had this experience or heard of others having to stop to get fuel. 

Am I crazy?  Is this normal? Is this just due to weather and unusual high altitude winds? I think I'm well versed on airline/airplane topics but I am not in the industry. Can someone offer insight? 

Thanks"

Some time after that still before takeoff, she got up from her seat walked to a specific seat and asked them to unplug their phone. So how did she know that someone was using the outlet and is it possible that using the outlet could affect the plane."

I watch videos, read publications, listen to podcasts, etc. about the subject and have also started with flight simulators.  One thing I have noticed with the aviation nerd community is the extremely impassioned opinions regarding Airbus vs. Boeing, like it would make you think you were reading a debate on the Israel-Palestine conflict or something.

Most of the comments I read are also totally without merit.  I watch a YouTube video to learn about the 737 Max and half the comments are like unsubstantiated one-liners like “The a320 neo is hands-down better” and “if it ain’t Boeing, I ain’t going” and so forth.  Most people seem to comment based exclusively on which they think looks better, or which airline configures the seats in the cabin better, or rarely something like “the 737 climbs better and has a higher service ceiling”, but ultimately, what do these things even matter?  It isn’t a military interceptor.  The planes are both widely popular, similarly reliable, do the same job, and the 737NG has basically the identical fatalities per departures as the a320.  From a passenger’s point of view, the negligible preferences don’t seem to warrant all the hatred.  I have been on wonderful, spacious 737’s operated by Southwest but also shitty crammed ones operated by other carriers.  JetBlue has a very spacious a320, but US Airways was not as nice.

I would be more interested in what the airlines actually think and how they figure one serves their operations better, or what pilots think, and I see pilots who are big fans of both.  I imagine that the planes are so operationally similar that even things like geopolitics play a bigger role sometimes than economics, like Poland’s LOT going with the 787 and bucking the European solidarity with Airbus and the animosity Poland and the EU have right now.

Then there are interesting situations where an airline will fly both, either because of a merger or other circumstances like Aeroflot not wanting to be too dependent on any foreign manufacturer.  The arrival of the MC-21 in a few years will be very interesting too.

Is there a good reason to feel particularly loyal of one aircraft manufacturer than the other?  I even own shares in Boeing and I don’t particularly care if I have to travel on an Airbus.  Aside from the seats being more cramped than the Republic E-jet I was connecting on, the Air France a380 was such a wonderful flight!"

77,Virgin-Alaska and questions on Airline Branding,0,62jwtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/62jwtv/virginalaska_and_questions_on_airline_branding/,4,2017-03-31 11:57:32,"Hi all,

With the recent acquisition of Virgin America by Alaska Airlines in the United States, I came to wonder about some of the potential questions management and branding employees come to face in times of mergers and growth.

As it stands, Alaska seems to be taking over Virgin's route network as well as fleet (among others). The Virgin name will disappear, and Alaska will find itself in a very dominant position on the West coast. This is all fine and good, but I can't help but feel it being a bit silly for an airline situated throughout the West coast to call itself ""Alaska Airlines"". 

Geographic-based names and branding aren't uncommon of course, but they tend to be present in situations where a niche is being served and growth/competition aren't really present (think of Hawaiian, Air Seychelles, Air France, etc.). These brands tend to be able to get away with these names because of their niche, high-end, flag carrier status. More often than not, these airlines get subsidized by their respective governments anyway to allow for their operation.

Southwest is a definite exception here, but it can be argued that they really managed to distance themselves from the geographic name entirely by giving little focus to the Southwest U.S. at all. Many airlines like the startup low-cost long-haul ""Level"" from IAG chose for a name with no geographic ties to aid future growth, even though it will be based in Barcelona.

While Alaska Airlines has a strong brand in its area (which is more Seattle than it is Alaska anyway), I was wondering if it would be in order for a brand change? Picking up from where Virgin left off is a big task, and the trendy West doesn't really seem all too ready for their arrival. I'd figure a snazzier brand would be more in line with their low-cost aspirations. Not necessarily Virgin, but something a little similar.
I'm from the East coast, so thankfully I've still got my lovely JetBlue anyway.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Alaska Airlines should probably give itself a name/brand change to allow for a more smooth expansion along the West Coast. Agree/disagree?"

I asked some questions regarding becoming a pilot yesterday and received some awesome responses. I was curious about JetBlue’s training program from 0 hour to ATP. What are you guys’ opinions as pilots? I don’t know how to recognize a good program from a bad one and I would love some expert advice. Some information:
I’m an 18 year old Georgia resident. College is preferred by family but if I find a good alternative that sets me up then I can skip college as I am academically gifted. I would be willing to relocate for a good program, but my overall goal is to save money. 

Thanks for all your help!"

The conference features presentations and keynotes speakers from NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, Delta Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Piedmont Airlines, the Aviation Technician Education Council, the Air Line Pilots Association and the U.S. Air Force, among others.

Attendees from the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands are participating as subject experts, including leaders in the aviation industry and from Embry-Riddle and other universities. Emerging topics focus on the accelerating demand for more pilots and mechanics, the introduction of new technology in aviation, the training and implications of personal air vehicles and unmanned aircraft systems and educating students at a younger age in aviation-related fields.

Embry-Riddle President P. Barry Butler, Ph.D., told the audience he was pleased to see symposium topics expanded to include aviation maintenance as well as autonomous vehicles and cyber security. His opening remarks also mentioned a number of programs at Embry-Riddle that are helping to address key issues such as pilot demand, including Embry-Riddle’s Daytona Beach and Prescott campuses partnership in the new Delta Propel Pilot Career Path Program, to identify, select and develop the next generation of pilots.

A 2017 Boeing study estimated that more than 600,000 commercial airline pilots will be needed globally over the next two decades.

In addition to Delta and other airlines, JetBlue Airways is working on creative approaches to pilot sourcing, including partnerships with universities such as Embry-Riddle, to help feed the pipeline, according to Nancy Shane, Ph.D., who has a master’s degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry-Riddle, and is manager of Pilot Gateway Programs at JetBlue.

Representatives from the Air Line Pilots Association also discussed education outreach programs providing guidance to pilots seeking employment and mentoring assistance.

New pilot training models such as mixed reality, augmented reality and virtual reality was featured topics on the first day of the conference.

Lulu Sun, Ph.D., Embry-Riddle associate professor of Engineering, presented “Exploring the Best Practices of Virtual Training Delivery for the Prospective Air Traffic Controllers.” Stephanie Fussell, an Embry-Riddle doctorate student in Aviation discussed “Implementing Immersive Virtual Reality in an Aviation/Aerospace Teaching and Learning Paradigm,” and William L. Little, aerospace technologist for software systems with NASA, talked about NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Augmented/Virtual Reality Lab.

Attendees also saw first-hand how augmented reality can be used, from seeing inside an actual aircraft engine to preflight training, as demonstrated by Lori Brown, associate professor and researcher from Western Michigan University, in her presentation, “Holographic Micro-simulations to Enhance Aviation Training with Mixed Reality.”

“Right now the airline industry is facing as much stress in the hiring domain as it has in years,” said Michael E. Wiggins, Ph.D., professor and department chair of Aeronautical Science for Embry-Riddle’s Daytona Beach Campus. “There is a big push to try to get flight students through the training faster, quicker, cheaper and more effective so that we can continue to safely operate the National Air Space System.”

Some of the highlights on it are an Atlas Air Boeing 747 I spotted without a flight radar after getting a haircut, a JetBlue Airbus A320 with an NYPD livery, and others. I also kept details on registration, date of delivery, exact configuration, flight route, and what airlines the aircraft has served, assisted by a flight radar and a planespotting database. Any suggestions on improvement are welcome!
