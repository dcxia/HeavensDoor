Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say “Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what?”

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program’s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program’s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline’s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won’t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don’t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE’s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR’s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let’s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don’t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are “Savers” awards, and “Anytime” awards.  

“Savers” are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline’s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

“Anytime” are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I’m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay’s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it’s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It’s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United’s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let’s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don’t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won’t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don’t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can’t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don’t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven’t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let’s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline’s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like “Use Miles”.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let’s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn’t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline’s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people’s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for “Mixed Class”, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can’t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let’s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it’s own, but I’ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people’s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don’t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline’s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip…

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can’t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You’ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don’t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you’ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state “On Request”.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to “Ticketed”.  In the past, I’ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline’s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline’s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don’t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn’t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don’t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

##What is next?

There are tons of topics we did not cover in this Basics guide.  How to transfer Points, how to actually search for rewards, how to determine which FF to use, etc.  Let me know what topics you would like to see me cover in the future.

1,Award Tickets 101: How To Find The Best Redemption,128,4aymw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4aymw5/award_tickets_101_how_to_find_the_best_redemption/,40,2016-03-18 18:56:16,"One of the questions that seems to come up a lot lately on this sub is “how do I find the best redemption to X destination on my points/miles?” Since we have been getting the question almost daily, I decided to put together a 101 type of post on one of the processes for finding the best/least expensive redemption. You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your URs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time

Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your TYPs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

Airline | Alliance | Total Mileage Balance
:--------:|:--------:|:---------: 
Delta | SkyTeam | 109,000 Miles
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 110,000 Miles
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 65,000 Miles
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
American Airlines	 | OneWorld | 54,000 Miles
British Airways | OneWorld | 109,000 Miles
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 44,000 Miles
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 110,000 Miles
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qantas | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 175,000 Miles
United Airlines | Star Alliance | 99,000 Miles
EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for “yyy Award Chart” (with ‘yyy’ being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you’re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control – regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA’s award chart – not LAN’s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the process that I use for determining the best redemption value for my points and miles, so hopefully it helps shed some light on how to find the best redemption value for your trip."
2,Offered free Gold Status on AA for 3 months even though I typically fly United. Worth booking upcoming flights on AA instead of United?,17,c2bqfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c2bqfl/offered_free_gold_status_on_aa_for_3_months_even/,45,2019-06-19 07:05:46,"I checked my e-mail today and found American Airlines offered me free gold status until 9/25. The promotion is to maintain gold through Jan 2021 by spending $850 EQD and going 7,000 EQMs by 9/25.

This came as a surprise as I am not a loyal AA flyer. I fly somewhat often for work, ranging from 3-6 days a month. I have 9.9K miles on AA, about 6K flown this year from trips to Vegas, Miami, and Boston.

&#x200B;

My upcoming trips (none of are booked yet):

\-RT DC to Madison for work (highly likely)

\-RT DC to Orlando for work

\-RT DC to San Francisco for work

\-1 way DC to Boston (other way is  on Jetblue, this was a personal trip so I went with who was cheaper)

&#x200B;

Looking at my trips above and roughly calculating cost, it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation. (I'll likely have one other work trip thrown in, but these are confirmed) which would get me to gold on AA through 2021. However, I typically fly United since I grew up near a hub and tried to stay somewhat loyal when convenient and/or affordable. I have 27K miles on United but not any status (and a RT flight to Spain booked on United). I was planning to book all of my above trips on United for this reason, to keep accruing miles.

&#x200B;

So my question is:

1. Should I switch plans and book all of my upcoming trips on AA instead of United to hit the promotion? Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?
2. Would it make sense to abandon loyalty to United and start flying AA going forward? I feel like if I switched to AA with the promotion I'm dividing up my miles and not really highly accruing on either (I'dbe about even on both airlines by Sept.)

&#x200B;

Some Notes:

\-I care more about being able to accrue miles (maybe to book a free trip in the near future) than say upgrades. The extra legroom perk would be nice since I'm tall but I wouldn't give up accruing more miles on one airline for that, especially since I can expense it for work flights on longer trips anyway.

\-I don't have a travel credit card except the Uber Barclays Card (3% cahs back regardless of brand).

\-I live close to DCA (an AA hub). United also flies out of DCA and has a hub in Dulles which isn't so far

\-I don't have strong feelings one way or the other about the brands. I've generally never had a problem on either.

\-For what it's worth, I'm silver on Marriott which has some kind of partnership with United

&#x200B;

Any help from those who are travel savvy or better understand the point system is appreciated!"
3,JFK/LAX to BKK - Short Notice,4,8bekbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/8bekbc/jfklax_to_bkk_short_notice/,38,2018-04-11 08:58:25,"Hey, I've been looking for several months for a round\-trip flight to Bangkok for two people. It can be from anywhere JetBlue flies, as I’ll be flybg from Florida to there using separate points \(so JFK, LAX, etc\), and in any class. We were still building up my girlfriend's points, so weren't able to book until now. I know it's very short notice. I'm a little panicky myself!

We each have 140k UR points.

The trip will be for 21 days, leaving sometime on/after May 11th, but it can happen in June too.

I was hoping for F/J on ANA using UR to Virgin Atlantic deal, but there's no availability that I could find. Nothing shows up for LAX \(not sure if I'm doing it wrong\), and everything for JFK is waitlisted.

It's 150k pts \+ fees for mixed j/econ class flights elsewhere on United's site. 80k \+ $50 for economy.

I've found cash economy tickets for $700 though, so it doesn't make sense to use 80k pts. I'd love to have business class, at least one way, but cannot find anything. I'm not sure if I'm just missing something huge or what, but I'd love some help.

I checked awardhacker without much luck too. I'm thinking cash is my best bet, but I'm sure I'm wrong.

4,Award Ticket Basics Part I - Non-Airline Miles Redemptions,51,5t5l93,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5t5l93/award_ticket_basics_part_i_nonairline_miles/,35,2017-02-10 08:47:18,"##Award Ticket Basics  Part I - Non-Airline Miles Redemptions

Feb 8th, 2017

As more and more people get into churning, more and more folks find their way to r/awardtravel, and basic award redemption questions are popping up daily.  While we have some great guides on the sidebar, It looks like we are missing some pointers on award tickets.  This article will discuss some of the basic concepts in award travel.

###What is an Award Ticket?

The concept is pretty simple here:  Award Ticket is a airline ticket that you get by redeeming Airline Miles, Airline Points, Bank Miles, or Bank points.  The ticket usually is paid for entirely via your points/miles, but you may have to pay for taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges separately.  Notice that I listed multiple currencies that can be used for award tickets, and this is where much confusion and complexity comes into the picture.

###List of Different Award Tickets Types

I’m going to start by listing different But common award ticket types.  I’m trying to be complete, but I’m sure I’m going to miss some.  Feel free to leave me a note to add to this.

- Using Chase Ultimate Rewards Point in Chase Portal
- Using Citi Thankyou Points in Citi Portal
- Using AmEx Membership Rewards Points in AmEx Portal
- Using Barclays Rewards Points 
- Using Capital One Venture Reward Miles
- Using Southwest Airline Rapid Rewards Points
- Using JetBlue TrueBlue points
- Using Airline Miles to redeem Saver Awards
- Using Airline Miles to redeem Anytime Awards
- Using Airline Miles to redeem for Saver Awards on Partner Airlines

In Part I, I’m going to cover all the non-airline Miles redemptions.  In part II, I will be covering Airline Miles redemptions, award charts, alliance partners, etc.

### Using UR/MR/TY Points in a Portal

This is probably the most simple award ticket type.  When you are booking a ticket through a bank portal, you are effectively redeeming your points at a fixed value, and buying the desired ticket.  For example, if you have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card, then redeeming for a ticket at the UR portal will give you an exchange rate of 1.5 cents per point.  This means that if you find a flight listed for $300, you will need to spend 20,000 UR points for that ticket.

#### Pros:

- You are not dependent on airlines making award seats available on the desired flight.  Since you are effectively buying a ticket, as long as there is a seat left on the flight, you can redeem for that seat.
- Since you are effectively purchasing the seat, if the fare class earns miles, you will earn miles after you complete the flight.
- You are basically booking through a travel agent, so you don’t have to study award charts or other complications.
- The redemption cost typically is all inclusive.  Fees and taxes will just be paid for via points as well.

#### Cons:

- Some fare class earn little or no miles.  If you redeemed for the lowest cost ticket, you probably shouldn’t count on earning lots of miles for the flight.
- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your redemption cost just went up as well.
- Bank Portals don’t always have the lowest price tickets. A common complaint is that people can find a cheap flight elsewhere, but unable to match that price in the Portal.
- The high prices for premium class tickets means those redemptions are often out of reach.  A $7,500 First Class ticket would cost 500,000 UR points, and very few people can accumulate that many points via churning. 

#### When should you redeem through a Portal

- When the airfare is low.  If there is a $600 RT ticket to Asia, that will only cost you 40,000 UR points, and that is lower than every other redemption choices.
- When you MUST fly on a certain flight.  If the flight you need do not have other award seats, you are left with buying the ticket.  It becomes a choice on whether you will pay cash to save your points, or pay with your points to save the cash.
- When you can’t find a better deal by transferring your points to a particular airline.  If your goal is to travel in premium class, your best bet is to save these points to transfer to an airline program.

### Using Barclay/Capital One Miles/Points

You’ve seen the commercials, how Capital One miles can be used on any airline anytime.  Well, that is because while Barclay and Capital One call them “Miles”, they are basically Points that are worth 1 cent each when redeeming for travel.

For both of these banks, the points are very easy to use, and they have the added bonus they can be used to redeem for any expense coded as Travel.   For example, I have redeemed Barclay Award Miles for the cost of a bus tour, as well as tickets for a train ride.  To begin the redemption process, just purchase your travel/airline ticket either through a website or a travel agent, and pay using your Barclay/Capital One card.  In a few days, the charge will show up online in your credit card account, and you can redeem your Award points against the travel charges as statement credit.  So if you bought a $200 airline ticket on your Capital One Venture card, you can select that $200 charge, and “erase” that charge by redeeming 20,000 Venture Miles.

#### Pros:

- You are not dependent on airlines making award seats available on the desired flight.  You can find the cheapest ticket that works for you, and just buy it.
- You are purchasing the ticket, and if the fare class earns miles, you will earn miles after you complete the flight.
- You don’t have to study award charts or other complications.
- You can usually pay for Fees and taxes as well if they are part of the same charge.
- You can redeem for other travel charges, such as train tickets, rental cars, etc
- You can pay for a ticket to help with meeting minimum spend on a card, then use the point you earn to get statement credit for the same ticket.  This is one of few cases you can use your bonus before you actually earn them.

#### Cons:

- Some fare class earn little or no miles.  If you bought the lowest cost ticket, you probably shouldn’t count on earning lots of miles for the flight.
- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your points don’t go as far.
- There are restrictions on redemptions.  For example, Barclays Arrival Plus card requires the charge to be at least $100 before you can redeem miles against it.  That means if you have only 9,900 Miles, you can’t redeem the points at all.  The Arrival card has a lower limit of $25.
- The high prices for premium class tickets means those redemptions are often out of reach.  A $7,500 First Class ticket would cost 750,000 Venture Miles, and very few people can accumulate that many Miles. 

#### When should you use Barclay/Capital One Miles

- When there are no other points that can be used.  For example, you can use Barclay Arrival+ to pay for a train ticket, and later redeem the points to reduce the cost.  You can’t do that with other points/Miles.
- When you find a great price on a ticket, but the price is not available through a bank portal.

### Using Southwest/JetBlue points

Southwest and JetBlue points are sometime referred to as “fixed value” redemptions, even though they actually aren’t fixed.  In both cases, the amount of points needed to redeem for an award ticket is directly proportional to the price of the ticket being sold at that time, but the exchange rate is modified by the airline for various reasons that they don’t publish.  Typically, both Southwest and JetBlue points are valued between 1.4-1.7 cents per points.  To be clear, I have bundled these two points program together in this discussion since they are similar, but Southwest points can only be used to fly on Southwest, and JetBlue points can only be used to fly on JetBlue.  JetBlue points can also be used to redeem for flights with Hawaiian airlines also in a fixed value fashion.

To redeem these points, just goto the respective website, and search for the flight you want, with the option set to Use Points.  The airline website will tell you how many points it will cost, and as long as a seat is available and you have the points, you can redeem for it.  

#### Pros:

- As long as a seat is available, you can redeem points for it.
- The valuation is typically in a tight range, so you know how much your point is worth.
- You don’t have to study award charts or other complications.

#### Cons:

- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your points don’t go as far.
- Since the valuation is fixed, you probably won’t find any outsized redemption options.
- Ticket paid for by points will not earn additional points.

#### When should you use Southwest or JetBlue points?

- When you are flying Southwest or JetBlue, and you have enough points to redeem.  There is very little reason to hold these unless you have bigger plans for those points, such as a possible future JetBue Mint redemption.

8,Hawaii Trip,1,7ihst6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7ihst6/hawaii_trip/,25,2017-12-08 23:38:31,"I know there are a lot of posts about Hawaii...so here’s another one!

My fiancé and I are getting married in April 2018. We're planning a delayed honeymoon - probably August - October timeframe. Our leading candidate for destination is Hawaii. I've spent the past few days researching all the different ways to get there with points. I have the following points: 260k UR, 130k MR, 40k United, 120k SW, 70k JetBlue, 140k Hilton, 130k Marriott, 80k SPG.

I realize that the cheapest way to get there with points is probably transferring to Korean Air. However, I think I want to book the tickets before we're actually married and I know they have restrictions on that. I know there are a few other cheap options (Air France, British Airways, etc.) but I would really like to fly at least one way in first class. It seems like the best first class going to Hawaii is on Hawaiian Airlines. If we're not flying first class, I would at least like a plane with 2-X-2 seating. I believe that leaves either a 767 or A330. All of Hawaiian's flights appear to be on an A330 with 2-4-2 seating. The only reasonable option I see for a 767 is Delta metal booked through Air France but the availability is a pretty iffy. Also, I'm thinking of using the UR points on hotels. It doesn't seem like MR points transfer as well to hotels.

This is the itinerary I came up with and points/cost for each leg.

* TPA > JFK on JetBlue (Coach for 7.3k or $119 per Person)

* JFK > HNL on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First 80k MR Points per Person)

* HNL > OGG on Hawaiian ($73 per Person - I will try to see if I can get the Amex Plat Reimbursement on these.)

* OGG > SFO on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First $567.33 per Person)

* SFO > FLL on JetBlue (Mint for 33.7k or $449 per Person)

* FLL > TPA on Southwest (8k or $134 per Person)


Total:

* 73.8k JetBlue (for 2 People w/10% Credit from JetBlue Plus Card) ~1.84 cents/point

* 160k MR Points (for 2 People) ~2.09 cents/point

* 16k SW Points ~1.67 cents/point

* $1,280.66 (for 2 People)


Am I being crazy with all of this? Should I just book round trip with Air France or British Airways and likely get stuck in a middle site for 5+ hours?"
9,Going to be doing a lot of NYC to Washington DC travel and looking to maximize points/gain status,12,abq1lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/abq1lc/going_to_be_doing_a_lot_of_nyc_to_washington_dc/,26,2019-01-02 07:53:54,"I'm going to be going back and forth from NYC to DC relatively frequently (maybe 4-6 flights a month? Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"

I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex’s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The “high season” is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 “high season” will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The “low season” is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “low season” and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “high season”. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “low season” and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “high season”.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions – Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic’s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al’s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al’s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (“WS”) is January 1 – March 24 and November 1 – December 31, while the Summer Season (“SS”) is March 25 – October 31.  El Al’s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan – from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!"

tl;dr: I finally started burning through my points last Jan 2016. On my second trip in Feb 2016, I was drunk at the hostel bar and challenged myself to do 12 trips in 12 months. It just so happened to be 14 trips because I took a trip in Dec 2015 and Jan 2016.

Detailed Trips or as best as I can remember it.

| Location/Date | Cash/Points | Notes |

Tokyo Dec 2016 | **60k Skypesos** on Delta Y, JFK-MSP-HND | Delta had a flash sale promoting their MSP - HND route. JFK happened to be on that promotion, JFK - MSP - HND. I wanted to go back to Tokyo for sometime now and figured a long weekend in Tokyo would be fun. I stayed at a capsule hostel, partied and ate my weekend away. Hoping to do this again sometime this year.
Singapore, Maldives, Tokyo Jan 2017 | **93.k SQ miles** on SQ Suites JFK-FRA-SIN, One way cash flight to MLE on tigerair, **75k Hyatt** for Park Hyatt Maldives, **15k Avois** MLE-CMB-SIN, **40k UA miles** on ANA F SIN-NRT, **80k AA miles** on JAL F | So this was my biggest goal and redemption. So this was my biggest goal and redemption. For years I’ve read about SQ Suites and my #1 goal in churning was this and I got it. Stayed in a hostel again in Singapore and man was it humid. I figured since I was in Signapore and the Maldives was so close, why not try and go for it. Park Hyatt didn’t have free nights available for my certificates but it was available for 25k per night. Booked 3 nights and paid for a cheap tigerair fight out. In hindsight, the tigerair was late at night, didnt get to PH until 1am. That was a waste. I’ve never been to a resort before and this was beautiful. Oh yea, used my Arrival miles to pay for the transfer fee. For this trip, I wanted to fly out of Tokyo either on JAL or ANA. I flew back to SIN using avois on SriLankan Y. I found a cheap 40k UA miles one way on ANA F. Hell yea I’m taking it and to my surprised it on the BB-8 plane. Spent another weekend in Tokyo, ate and drank away. JAL opened up and I took it home from NRT-JFK for 80k AA miles. I flew around the planet in 11 days.
Rome Feb 2017 | **60k Skypesos** on Altalia Y | I was itching to go away again and went to Rome for a long Prez weekend. Stayed at the Yellow Hostel, which I recommend to everyone. Toured, ate and drank away. I’m not religious by any means but man the Vactican was impressive. I’d love to visit again. During this weekend, I was drunk at the hostel bar and figured to myself why not try and do 12 trips in 12 months for 2017. 
Cancun Mar 2017 | **6k Jetblue** one way JFK-CUN, Cash flight Delta with gc CUN-JFK, **2 night free Hyatt Cert** at Hyatt Zilara | Used my 2 Hyatt free night at Hyatt Zilara Cancun. Beautiful property, great good. My friend and I ate our way through this weekend. Sushi was trash.
Puerto Rico April 2017 | **25k Merrill points** | This weekend happened to have a big storm in NYC. My flight delayed for 2 days. Tested out the trip delay insurance and hey they approved it even tho JFK was my home airport. Spent 2 days in Puerto Rico. Wish I had more time to explore.
Iceland May 2017 | Cash flight | Went to Iceland for a long Memorial day weekend. Stayed a hostel again. Man Iceland is f’king expensive. I could not be the foodie like I wanted to because it was so expensive. Went on a tour that took us to a natural hot spring, that was cool. Didn’t do blue lagoon. Made a hostel friend and tagged along his ride for the day. Love to go back when I have some extra extra money. The daylight at 2am was insane. Definitely messed with my head
Havana June 2017 | **SW CP to Havana** | Made a churning friend and we went to Havana. Humid af, didn’t understand all the hype about it. Would not go back.
Tijuana July 2017 | Walked over to Tijuana | Ok, this one I cheated a bit. I was in town in San Diego for Comic Con and to make sure I was out of the country, I walked over the border to Tijuana, ate some tacos and walked back over.
Thailand August 2017 | **120k UA miles** on Asiana F going, **80k ANA J** back. | So this was booked over Thanksgiving 2016. My friend’s biggest goal was going to Thailand and we were researching ways to get there. He wanted to fly any J class and we found 80k Asiana J one way. Impulsively we booked it roundtrip. Over the course of 2017, I moved over another 40k from UR to UA and upgraded myself to Asiana F. The look on my friend’s face when he realized I was flying F day of, was priceless. Of course I invited him down to my suite and we drank some whisky. We paid cash for our hotel stays in Thailand. Have to say, the Hilton gold came in handy for breakfast. Went to Bangkok, Chang Mai, Phi Phi Islands and Phuket. Love to go back and explore more of the islands. I hope that russian milf is doing well.
Bahamas September 2017 | **25k Skypesos** on Delta Y, **40k Hyatt** at Grand Hyatt Baha Mar | Delta had a flash sale to the Carribean for 25k and I moved over 40k UR and stayed at the new Grand Hyatt Baha Mar. Also used a club room cert to get access to the club lounge. I love free food. Another beautiful property and nice pools. Though wasn’t worth 40k points for the weekend.
Oslo & Bergen October 2017 | Cash flight on Norweign JFK-OSL and SAS BGO-OSL, **25k Merrill** points on TAP Portugal J OSL-LIS-JFK | Went on a trip with new churning friends. One of them found the cheap J fare from OSL-LIS-JFK on TAP Portugal, now we just have to made our way to OSL. We blew $300 each at Maaemo, a 3 michelin star restaurant. That was delicious. Drove our way up to Bergen from OSL, great views along the way. Took a flight back to OSL from BGO and flew back on TAP Portugal J. TAP was ok, nothing really to be excited about.
Singapore & Maldives November 2017 | **120k SQ miles** on SQ Suites, JFK-FRA-SIN. Cash at Marina Bay Sands. **15k Avois** SIN-CMB-MLE. **205.5k SPG** points at St. Regis Maldives. $100 flight MLE-DXB-JFK on Emirates | Sometime during 2017, Emirates had a mistake fare for MLE-JFK. Friend and I took advantage of that. He was jealous I went to the Maldives and the one way I’m going back is if I can get the St. Regis. Good thing for still living at home, I took advantage of my family(with their consent) a built up a stash of SPG points. Booked 3 nights overwater villa at 58.5k a night over Thanksgiving. No more availability for extra nights but cash and points were available for a garden villa for $300/15k points a night. Spent 5 days in the Maldives but shitty weather. Backtracking a bit, since I was transitting through Singapore, I wanted to try a fly SQ suites again. I didn’t get off the waitlist until 5 days before. I was adamant to take advantage of everything on the flight but I ended up sleeping through most of it. Met up with my friend in Singapore and we spent a night at Marina Bay Sands. Pool was beautiful but shitty weather.
Brussels & Paris December 2017/NYE | **60k Skypesos** JFK-BRU RT | This was my last trip for the year and I wanted to do NYE in another city. Figured lets go to Europe. Found a 60k flight RT, JFK-BRU. I didn’t want to spend all my time in BRU and so I went down to Paris for NYE. Stayed at a hostel, made some friends and partied into NYE. Went back to Brussels for a night and flew out.
Jamaica Jan 2018 | **15k Jetblue miles**, JFK-MBJ. Cash flight back. **2 Free night at Hyatt** Zilara Rosehall | This time my friend comes through. He got 2 free hyatt nights as well and wanted to go to another Zilara so we can pig out. I moved over enough points to cover one night so we’d get 3 nights. Got upgraded to a large Butler Suite. Property overall was not impressive. The jerk chicken and french restaurant was nice but thats about it. The pools were cold af. Would not come back here.


Overall, 2017 was my best year living life. Even though I traveled for mostly freeish, my bank account hurts. 

**Notes**

- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends, usually Thur-Tues. I also transferred over a decent amount of vacation days in Jan 2017 which helped out alot.

- Still living at home, which helps my bank account and I run through all our bills through my cards.

- Player 2 and half of 3 with family members, which helped me alot

- Still have 500k UR, 170K AA, 130k Skypesos, 100k SPG, 170k MR and others

- Looking to build up my points stash on my extra players in 2018.

- Itching to book another flight/trip. Really want to fly EY apartments."

I see that United has a direct flight to Geneva that is 8 hours for 30k points, but I wanted to see what other options there are out there. I'm not a big fan of Geneva since it is extremely expensive to stay there.

I will be hopping around Europe so I will be taking one way.

17,Advice for booking business/first Boston to Tokyo in late 2019,0,ayl7et,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/ayl7et/advice_for_booking_businessfirst_boston_to_tokyo/,19,2019-03-08 05:47:32,"Hi all- we are getting married in mid-October, and we are tossing around the idea of Japan for our honeymoon. I started doing a bunch of research about ways to book business or first with miles/points but am getting pretty overwhelmed, hoping someone may be able to steer me in the right direction. 

We have points spread across a number of different programs, listed below, broken down by mine (P1) vs hers.

Basically we are looking for: 

* Boston to Tokyo R/T
* Business or First
* approx. 11-15 days total
* Earliest possible date we could leave is ~10/16/2019; we’d consider anytime Nov/Dec, possibly Jan, depending on availability, pricing etc, but preference is late Oct / early-mid Nov
* We would plan to travel around Japan, rather than spending the full 2 weeks in Tokyo. But I assume Tokyo round trip is much more economical than open jaw?

Program | P1 | P2
-: | :- | :-
Chase UR | 328k | 218k
Amex MR | - | 60k
AAdvantage | 172k | 69k
BA Exec Club | 155k | -
Delta | 42k | 4k 
United | 123k | -
Southwest | 43k | -
JetBlue | 15k | 38k
Hyatt | 51k | 23k
Hilton | 5k | 20k
Marriott | 62k | 70k

Can anyone provide some guidance as to what I should be looking for, the best way(s) to search for availability, or any other general tips? Since there aren’t as many direct Boston to Tokyo flights, am I better off searching for award bookings from other cities, e.g. Chicago or LA to Tokyo, to get a better idea of actual cost of the main leg? Also I noticed that a lot of possible Bus/First flights I found were deceptive since the short leg, e.g. BOS-ORD was first but ORD-NRT was Economy. Are there other ways to weed those out? But I wouldn’t mind flying Economy on legs within the US (and am not opposed to 1-stop itineraries)

Or, would you recommend using some sort of award booking service to assist us with all this? 

Also we are both 3/24 for Chase and are willing to apply for new cards, Biz or personal. I might end up going for the SW Companion Pass (already got the personal Rewards Plus), though I know that wouldn’t help with a Japan trip. 

Thanks in advance."

I am an international student from Asia and have been in the US for a few years. Most of my miles are with United (as I thought United has good coverage in the US and great alliance with Asian carriers). However, I've been struggling now as I moved to Philly and most flights are with American or Delta. My goal is to in the future redeem miles for economy flights, mostly within the US or to Asia. I only have Chase UR points, not AMEX or Citi.

Would love to get some advice on how to maintain multiple programs and which programs I should credit my future miles to.

* AA flights: Should I stick with AA or credit to others like Alaska that has partners? I do have \~30k with AA now.
* Delta: Similarly, should I stick with Delta or credit to others? I have only 3k with Delta.
* I have upcoming flights with Virgin Atlantic, Jetblue, and Emirates. This makes me even more confused as they have many partners as well. For example, for Virgin Atlantic, I'm torn between its own program, Delta, or ANA. For Emirates, I'm torn between its own program, Alaska, and JAL.
* I recently found [wheretocredit.com](https://wheretocredit.com) but I still have a hard time comparing programs. Any advice?

The good:  Economy is fine, redeye is fine, 1.2M AA, 800k MR, 500k DL (No UR though), fly into LIM and probably cheap cash flights to IQT and CUZ.  Best departures are PIA, BMI, STL, IND, and ORD, but positioning is possible if needed.  Here is what I have so far:

AA Miles:

Connect through MIA on AA metal or Latam metal.  Seach using QF and call to book?

Connect through DFW on AA metal

Connect through MCO, JFK, or LAX on Latam metal.  Seach using QF and call to book?

DL Miles:

\*A transferred from MR to...ANA?  Avianca?  Aeroplan?:

Connect through IAH or EWR on UN metal

Connect through PTY on Copa metal

I'm a novice at this, so I want to set up my FF game for success. Specifically, I'd like advice on which airlines I should commit to to earn miles in for both oneworld and star alliance. I'm basically starting from scratch in both (previously had been JetBlue loyal).

My goals are not super ambitious at this point. I'd like to be smart about capitalizing on some upcoming international travel if possible, and maybe get a free international trip or two when all is said and done. I don't really care about status or lounges or anything.

Assumptions I'm making (please correct me if any of this isn't true):

* I should pick one airline in each of the major alliances to accrue miles on
* I can accrue miles on one airline while flying another as long they're part of the same alliance
* I can redeem miles on any airline in an alliance regardless of the airline loyalty program they were accrued in (I know exchange rates, availability, etc. vary)

Couple of other things to note:

* I have to use a company credit card to pay for company travel
* My company prefers Delta and UA domestically (AA is out of policy)
* I have two international trips coming up, one in September to Japan (business class), the other to Scotland in October (likely flying economy w/ BA).

So

* For my upcoming international trips, should I bank miles in BA or AA or someone else?
* For my ongoing domestic business travel, should I accrue on UA and Delta or pick international carriers to apply miles to?
* What other questions should I be asking?

Thanks in advance for your help. Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this, but it sure looks like you guys know your stuff."

25,Hawaiian miles,8,9boo94,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9boo94/hawaiian_miles/,17,2018-08-31 03:48:29,"I had about 48k Hawaiian miles that I forgot about, and which expired a few years ago. Id read that their policy was to charge exorbitant fees to bring them back to life so never bothered. This week I decided to call and ask, and was told all I had to do was purchase points worth ten percent of what had expired and then request they be put back on my account. So I bought 5k points for about $158 and now have... 53k hawaiin miles. 

At the very least I can use them for $400 plus in JetBlue flights so I don't feel bas about laying out the cash. But that's a bad redemption. Problem is I have no plans to fly to Hawaii any time soon, or Asia. The only other redemption I can see is a round trip flight on virgin to london for 60k in economy. That's a route I take fairly often, but will that redemption via Hawaiian miles come with the regular taxes and fees that virgin tacks on? If not then that might be appealing once I have a few amex points to top off my Hawaiian account.

Otherwise, anything I'm missing? If I was going to Hawaii or Asia I might work to build this into more, but I'd rather spend them now on something useful."

tl;dr: I can probably get myself up to 200-250k Avios if I put all my eggs into the Avios basket. But is it worth it?

**First things first - my current balances** 
			
	American Airlines (AAdvantage) **	119,733		
	British Airways (Executive Club) **	72,800		
	JetBlue Airways (trueBlue) **	21,787		
	JetBlue Airways (trueBlue) **	14,836	wife

	Marriott Rewards **	17,906					
	Amex (Membership Rewards)	52,877		
	Barclaycard Arrival Plus	1980		
	Chase **	28,075	

We do not MS. I probably can't get the full 100k Avios from the current offer without MS, but if I open an LRCU account I can easily get 50k + 25k = 75k avios.

Note 1: we have the SW companion pass via my wife's account through 12/16. So no sense going for more SW points right now, we'll focus on that late next year to re-up our CP.

Note 2: Neither of us is eligible for CSP thanks to new rules. Original plan was to get 2 of those. Wife had it once 3 years ago. I have Ink+ Biz card and earn 1200 points monthly from auto billpay to cable/phone companies.

Note 3: I am not getting the current United 50k targeted offer, only the 30k offer.	

Note 4: Wife got 50k Amex MR bonus in 2014, converted points to BA Avios during 1.4x redemption, card is cancelled. Neither of us have had the Amex platinum.

Note 5: We do not MS. I am open to the idea of the $15k LRCU account hack, though.

Note 6: FICO 812, income is good.

**My trip desires**

My wife is a teacher and I have decent vacation time. We'd like to do 3-4 weeks somewhere we haven't been before that won't break the bank with food/hotels. Ideal destinations include Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Budapest, all of Asia, India, all of Africa (esp S. Africa), all of Australia/NZ. Flexible travel dates late July/August 2016. Asia is probably highest on the list for both of us, but we're open.

It would be fun to move around a bit during the trip, but neither of us love flying so we mostly want to have one long travel day coming and going and minimize flying around once we're there. 1-2 additional flight days max during the trip. It would be fun to travel in business or first but we're not going to kill ourselves getting points to upgrade. 

I've never been to London and would be open to 3-4 days there even though it's an expensive city. But I'd rather not pay their enormous taxes on ""free"" flights.

Not interested in anywhere US, Canada, Caribbean, Latin America, or Eastern Europe for this trip - we want to go somewhere new :)

Home airport is Boston, easy enough to get to JFK via JetBlue points if necessary.

**Card thoughts**

Wife and I can probably swing one more card each this fall, depending on minimum spend. Then we can probably do another card each in the winter. So we want to put those cards towards points so we can redeem them early. In the winter we can probably each do another card, probably go for hotel cards at that point. Might go for a third set of cards next spring, again with hotel cards.

My original plan was to load up on Chase UR points by getting each of us a CSP. But that plan is now ruined thanks to the 5/24 rule.

I was then going to go for United points by going for the Chase United cards, but the 50k deals seem to have vanished except for business cards - I have a biz card via Ink, not sure if I can get the United biz card or not.

Looks like I missed the 100k Amex Platinum deal (I was on vacation using my SW companion pass, so I won't complain too much!).

Am still keeping my fingers crossed that the 140k RC offer comes back so we can do a fly + stay redemption.

I have zero use for airport lounge access, fee reimbursements, or most other perks. All I want is points.

**Questions**

Given my limited options to get more AA points, get Chase UR points via CSP, or get a decent stockpile of United miles, it seems like I should focus on BA. But I have never heard anything good about Avios except short haul (we don't want short haul for this trip) and have never had great experiences with their website. And since flying F or J on BA is now ludicrously expensive via points AND has huge surcharges on BA metal via London, I'm hesitant to go all in on Avios. So...

* Should I transfer my MR points to BA before the devaluation on 10/1?
* Should I go for the current BA card offer, recognizing that I don't MS and this might present an opportunity cost if some other better offer comes up?
* Are there other offers I'm missing that will help us have a truly memorable trip?
* If I do go all-in on Avios, is there some amazing routing/destination that will maximize my fun with Avios? I really don't care too much where we go next summer as long as it's new to us and beautiful.
* If I decide not to pursue Avios as a strategy, what's should I do instead?

Looking to travel to Maldives, Singapore, Japan, Bali, and possibly Sydney. Sometime in September/October 2019 for 3 weeks w/ 2 people. Hotels I have covered through Hilton & SPG credit cards. My paralysis comes from the crazy number of options and combinations for flights (High likelihood I'm overcomplicating it). It seems like I can be leveraging excursionist/stopovers/open jaws, but for some reason they aren't slapping me in the face. Very open to positioning flights to LAX or JFK.

Couple Requirements: SQ Suites at some point, Business Class International, Either beginning or ending in Maldives (too hard to do in the middle of a trip)

Points: 320K+FNCs Hilton (Diamond), 100K Hyatt (Explorist), 500K+ Marriott (Plat), 300K Avios, 300K UR, 150K MR, 200K United (Silver), 120K Jetblue (for domestic)

My Thoughts were something along the lines of 

F1 Positioning: SFO-LAX (if needed)

F2: SFO/LAX-HND-SYD (Stopover in Japan)

F3: SYD-SIN-Bali (Stopover in SIN?)

F4: Bali-SIN-MLE

F4a: Seaplane Transfers (Covered by Amex GCs via Delta)

F5: MLE-SIN

F6 SQ Suites: SIN-FRA-JFK (NYC)

F7 Positioning: (NYC)-SFO


My Questions - 

1. Can I put two open jaws together to form a ""RT"" to get a stopover (I.E. F2 & F7, F1 & F3). Does anyone have advice on the first half of this trip (Is it even realistic to get 2 stopovers?)

2. Can I book SQ Suites from Maldives and combine F6+F7 (MLE-SIN-FRA-JFK). When I searched on Krisflyer, anytime I added MLE in the leg, it forced me into Biz Class search.

3. Can I use Avios anywhere here (minus the fuel surcharges etc.)

4. We are open to pushing the trip back a month or two in case I need to get a couple AA cards, but I'm hoping to find some combination with my current stash

29,First time redemption booked! Looking to learn for future redemptions.,11,8lm9ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/8lm9ia/first_time_redemption_booked_looking_to_learn_for/,15,2018-05-23 23:39:59,"Post-booking critiques welcome:

Right about at my 1 year churniversary I've finally made my first long-haul premium bookings with SO on points.

Leg 1: JFK -> IST 
LH/ J (~1 hr layover FRA to GVA, then GVA to IST (on TK)). 
The FRA-> IST direct TK leg wasn't available so I had to call UA to manually book as FRA->GVA->IST. 
Booked via united for 70k each + ~63$ tax. 

Hotel: Doubletree Istanbul - Sirkeci for 4 nights, paying cash (its ~$100/night). It's a short trip in IST so I picked this over the other istanbul hotels primarily because of location.

Leg 2: IST to ASR (cappadocia) 
TK Y (1 hr flight) booked via united for 8k each + ~6$ tax.

Hotel: Osmanbey Cave Hotel. It was about $90/night x2 nights so I paid cash. There weren't really any deals via CSR 1.5x on hotels that were in the area we wanted to be in.
Booked Hot air balloon ride via CSR 1.5x though for 24k UR.

Leg 3: ASR to MLE (via IST) 
TK J 
Booked via united 55k each + ~33$ tax. 

Hotel: Conrad Rangali, booked 95k/night x3 nights + 1 weekend cert. 
I have diamond status which ohopefully well help with upgrades. I have 2 nights beach villa 2 nights overwater villa, but I haven't quite decided exactly what I should finalize them as.
I would have done 5 nights on points to get 5th night free, but due to PTO I didn't want to sacrifice more time.

Just signed up for spark biz 1k that I plan on using for the sea plane $$$. 

Leg 4: MLE to IAD via DOH. 
QR in J. 
The DOH-IAD leg is in Qsuites which I think will be nice with SO.
I think QR provides a free hotel since the DOH layover is >8 hours. I need to confirm this. 
Booked via 70k AA miles each, + ~$70 tax which I will use part of my biz plat AA incidental reimbursement to cover, then use CSR to cover the rest for trip delay etc.

Since home airport is JFK, I'll be booking an IAD to JFK on jetblue for about 5k points each. 

Total costs:

MILES
266k UA (mostly transferred from UR)
140k AA
11k Jetblue

POINTS
285k Hilton + weekend cert from Ascend spend

$600 on the cash hotels.
$1100~ for seaplane
$1200-1500 Anticipated on the food in rangali (we don't drink so no need to worry about those costs) 

Only relevant cards included... I have spend and built miles via freedom and other MS too so the bonuses may not exactly have been the direct result of the booking:
CSR 100k
CIP #1 100k
CIP #2 100k
UA 40k

Amex HH Ascend
100k bonus + 200k MS'd

AA Plat biz 70k
AA Plat pers 70k
Jetblue Personal 40k
Spark $1000 bonus

This trip is for next month and I did all the booking over the past week, so availability was tough, otherwise aeroplan via TK probably would have been a good option to save a bunch of UR/UA miles. I could have done aeroplan anyway and paid taxes but it was basically the equivalent in taxes as it was for miles and I can build UR very easily via MS etc so I made the decision to burn them.

I would love to hear the experts' thoughts on the bookings so that I can learn!"
30,Do you ever burn miles in one program to preserve miles in another?,8,4pbxo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4pbxo0/do_you_ever_burn_miles_in_one_program_to_preserve/,15,2016-06-22 21:37:52,"Just curious what other people would do in my situation. I'm flying cross country in August (BOS-SFO) and don't want to use cash. I don't have any points in Virgin America or Jetblue. I have UR points but don't feel like burning 25k on a crappy United economy flight.

So the choices I see are: use Citi Thankyou portal to book a Virgin America 1 stop for 17k citi points; or use 30k AA miles to book a AAnytime 1 stop flight. Obviously the 1st option requires fewer points, BUT I only have 55k citi points, while I have 180k AA points. So I'd rather burn the AA points right now, even though it isn't as good a value.

Make sense? Agree/disagree? I'd appreciate reality checks :)"

I am looking to book an award flight to Europe in mid to late June from Washington DC. My preferred airport is DCA or IAD, but I can also get up to BWI. I could also do one of the NY airports if it is much cheaper, but I would really rather stay in the D.C. Area. 

I am ideally looking for a cheap redemption (I don't care for business class but if the opportunity presents itself for just a smaller addition amount of points I would consider it) to anywhere in Europe, and from that destination I can pay out of pocket with low cost carriers to go to my wanted destinations of Naples, Florence, Athens, and Cyprus. I want to fly for free for as much of my trip as possible. I realize that the low cost carriers in Europe - Ryan Air, Wizz Air, etc. - aren't bookable with points.

Since it's so far in the future, we have plenty of time to earn more points and miles before actually booking tickets, but right now I'm trying to figure out a general itinerary. 

Between the two of us, we have the following:

* 380k UR
* 270k MR
* 35k ThankYou
* 56k Southwest
* 31k Delta
* 10k United
* 36k Alaska
* 162k AA
* 18k BA
* 9k JetBlue

plus additional hotel points. My husband has an additional 50k UR pending. He is under 5/24, and I am not.

We want to spend about 3 weeks in Europe. We want to focus on Germany, but probably visit one to two other places while we are there--I'm thinking perhaps Amsterdam, somewhere in Belgium, and then cities in western Germany, but this is very flexible at this point. He has family in Stuttgart that we would consider visiting. We went to Switzerland in December 2018 and don't have any serious desire to return this soon. 

We will be traveling with at least two children--they will be 15 and 9 at that point, so visiting locations that they will enjoy will be key. We may also have an 18-month-old at that time, but whether he/she comes with us or not is also in question. (Baby is not born yet.) My husband and I want to fly in business and the 15 and 9 year old will fly economy. If the 18 month old is with us he/she will likely be a lap infant. Since the kids will fly economy, I'm open to booking their tickets with cash if we can get a great price on the same flights my husband and I would be on. We fly out of TPA but can easily get to MCO and can less easily get to MIA. We would prefer to go in early June, right after the kids get out of school.

Any thoughts? I know that right now it's super vague, my issue is that I don't really know where exactly we should go yet."

I know that's subjective, but I also know this isn't a high value use, but we don't care about first class redemptions - we'd earn and burn for as many trips in economy as we can. Also, we don't have any other travel through summer 2017 where we'd use these points, so they're just sitting there, taunting me.

My husband and I don't have as much travel flexibility as we'd like this year, so we're stuck trying for a short vacation over New Year's - when most of America has off. The other challenge is we first have to go to New York (JFK preferred, not EWR) to celebrate Christmas with family, and eventually end in SFO/OAK where we live. I prioritized nonstop flights to avoid getting stuck in some snowbound layover city.

I've been looking for a destination to spend 5 nights after Christmas through New Year's. I came up with New Orleans.

I've got 155k UR, 65k AA, 68k UA, 33k AA, 60k DL, 3k Jetblue. I also have 40k SPG, but I want to use that for our hotel.

Points and prices are for 2 tickets.

* SFO>JFK 12/22/16 Jetblue - transfer 38,500 MR points to Jetblue, $11.20 in fees (or pay $444)
* JFK>MSY  12/29/16 Jetblue - transfer 31,250 MR points to Jetblue, $41.65 plus $11.20 in fees (or pay $408)
* MSY>OAK 1/3/16 Southwest - transfer 35,000 UR points to SW, $11.20 in fees (or pay $518)

Total:
69,750 MR
35,000 UR
3,000 Jetblue
$75.45 in fees

versus paying $1,370 in cash

And, if you have any destination suggestions besides New Orleans, I'd love to hear your ideas! The only things we rejected are Mexico beach towns, ski vacations, and Europe and Japan since those are our other planned trips."

42,(Relatively) Frequent transcon Flyer out of JFK debating status - worth it at my level?,2,d7yn3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/d7yn3r/relatively_frequent_transcon_flyer_out_of_jfk/,13,2019-09-23 03:58:53,"I've been flying for business more frequently for a little over a year now and reflecting on the numbers, I'm wondering whether I should more seriously pursue some level of status with an airline for 2020 (I got geeky and made an Airtable base to track flight mileage).

I didn't take it too seriously before and have mostly flown JetBlue because I don't/didn't think I'd fly enough to get any worthwhile status on another airline, but am reconsidering and would love some thoughts from the group here. I really like their product and service all around and the frequency/timing of direct flights from JFK to the west coast, but realizing even if I hit Mosaic status, it's not really helpful as you don't get upgrades with it, and with no alliance/without many partners, I mainly get more JetBlue flights.

I also have heard from many people (and here) that since there are so many hardcore business flyers out of JFK, the odds of getting regular upgrades on my routes at a lower tier of status are pretty slim. Would consider opening another credit card to speed up/amplify benefits/miles earned. Currently use my CSR for everything.

My priority is to make my primary travel (to the West Coast) as comfortable as possible, but miles and upgrades for my vacations and other trips would be a nice bonus, just not sure I'll get any of them. I like JetBlue & Alaska (experiences, product, companies), am indifferent to AA/Delta, and despise United (plus don't want to be stuck with everything being out of EWR).

I like Delta's ~~transfer partners~~ alliance a bit more and my recent research makes me think I'd do okay with them. How's the product on the transcon flights on the 757? Would I actually \_get\_ any upgrades with Delta gold? (Maybe could even squeeze out Platinum if I shifted some of my other travel).

Thoughts?

Stats:

* I'm based in NYC, my preferred airport (by a long stretch) is JFK.
* Generally, I fly to the West Coast (SFO or LAX) for work at least 6 times a year, as well as various other ad hoc trips. Most domestic, but occassional international popping up as well. I'd generally be in Premium Economy but can sometimes get Business Class fares in my range.
* For personal travel, my future MIL is based in LA, so we usually go out there at least 2 more times a year. Plus other trips/vacations (3-4 times a year, sometimes domestic, sometimes international- South America and Europe recently and the near future).
* I'm on track to fly a little over 55k miles this year, likely the same or more next year as well."

49,[award advice] Two JetBlue flight certificates (anywhere they fly) but must use before October; where to go?,2,6j84pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6j84pk/award_advice_two_jetblue_flight_certificates/,11,2017-06-24 17:23:37,"Hi friends,

I got super-lucky last year and won a sweepstakes, but have no imagination and it's causing decision paralysis.

My girlfriend and I won two tickets anywhere in JetBlue's system. RT between any origin / destination pairs (but no Mint business class, and apparently no Cuba?).

We've both been really busy with work and haven't taken advantage, but now realize we only have until late September to use these passes before they expire. My girlfriend is changing jobs in August, so it finally gives us a 2wk window to use these without negotiating vacation time.

* We're both East Coast based (DCA / BOS), and Mosaic.
* Anything goes: we love city / exploration vacations, and speak relatively fluent Spanish, but flopping on the beach is also great.
* Have >200K SPG and >200K UR points if there's an awesome hotel / resort to build the trip around.

I'm aware this is a first world problem, but have been mildly stressing over where to go and would love your help!"
50,Trying to get 2 RT tickets to the Dominican Republic for my sister's honeymoon in November.,5,5py8hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5py8hy/trying_to_get_2_rt_tickets_to_the_dominican/,11,2017-01-24 22:40:07,"So for my sister's wedding present I'm trying to get her 2 tickets (economy) to Punta Cana, DR from Williamsburg, VA (flying out of Richmond, Norfolk, or Newport News) for her 6 night honeymoon. She's a bit flexible with her dates so that's a plus. Her friend is also having a wedding during this period so she needs to be down there for 6 nights and have time to get to the rehearsal dinner and wedding between Thursday Nov 2nd, 2017 - Saturday Nov 4th, 2017. So as long as she there's for those dates the arrival and depature dates can flex a bit as long as it doesn't go over 6 nights.

I'm currently working with these points:

UR - 16k
MR - 31k
AA - 206k
Barclycard Arrival Plus- 57k 

I've tried pricing this out on Jetblue or SW (was thinking about picking up their card and using my arrival plus points for the other ticket) but the prices are the same. 

Unfortunately it looks like all the saver award space has been taken so flying out of Richmond with 1 stop on AA and back looks like it's going to cost me 55k + $110 in fees (I also have $200 in AA giftcards so that should take care of fees)... so 2x that'll be 110k + $220.. 

It looks like if she flies back Nov 8th or 9th the return tickets could only be 12.5k each, but unfortunately that'll mean she'll have to fly out the day of the rehearsal dinner and if something were to happen she'd miss it. I feel like 55k is a lot for one RT is pretty high... is this as good as it gets or am I (probably) missing something? "
51,best option for EWR to MCO/ JAX?,0,cd9k9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cd9k9w/best_option_for_ewr_to_mco_jax/,11,2019-07-15 03:00:04,"I plan to travel RT to central FL on Aug 2 to Aug 5 with my GF, and I see direct flights from jetblue and United.

I think 45k UR is worth more than jetblue, so I'm leaning towards using my 52k JB points. 
52k seems a bit high for a short domestic flight but then again, it's for 2 people. Is there a cheaper option before I pull the trigger? I have 40~100k delta miles I can use as well."

I am looking to book a flight from SMF/SFO -> New York (open to any airport really, with slight preference to LGA) departing either 5/13 or 5/14 and returning 5/19-5/21.

I would prefer a non-stop flight, but I am open to a stop if needed!

Notes (I tried to do some due diligence beforehand and stretch my own award travel booking muscles, but ultimately could not figure out the best value redemption):

* It looks like JetBlue has some decent prices for a round trip flight from SMF->JFK (5/14-5/19 is $383 RT, so that's about 25K UR if I book through the Chase portal, but I value Chase UR as > 1.5 cpp)
* Southwest seems to have plenty of availability as well, but all the Southwest options have 1 stop and seem to be more expensive in terms of points than the JetBlue flights so it seems like an inferior option to JetBlue, at least for the time being
* United seems to have their cheapest flights priced at 50K United miles round trip since there's no saver availability for these dates, so that's an even worse option than Southwest/JetBlue.

What are the best options you all would recommend? Thanks in advance for reading!"

At all times the contractor is saying we can continue to live in our place -- we just may not want to, especially during the week. So I have been researching alternatives like airbnb, to fill in the times we may want to vacate the premises on short notice. I already travel a fair amount for business (about 40-50%).... and it occurred to me like a big d'oh that I could play this points game for free hotel stays... in our own town. 

I.e., no flights, just hotel stays, is our goal. We don't even care that much if it's a fancy hotel, as long as it's spackle free and close enough to work. 

Though I travel for work I have never really been interested in collecting points because long ago I used to be a couponer and I burned myself out on that game. I figured points were similar. But now I have motive... if even just for the short term.

I don't have a lot of points to start (about 40K Jetblue, 5K SPG), but I do have some travel coming up and will continue throughout the reno period. For work I nearly always stay at either a Starwoods or a Marriott. At home, we live in a big city with just about every option. I just signed up for Marriott Rewards and submitted some recent folios hoping they might comp me. I also signed up for the MR CC for the 80K points. I otherwise have little interest in becoming a churner. 

So... if you were in this situation, how would you play this?  What would your strategy be? "

I'm hoping one of you can give me some simple advice. 

Here's the deal: I earn a decent amount of Amex Gold reward points (about 500/month). I live near an American hub, but AMEX doesn't transfer directly to AA, so I've been transferring them to BA, because I've read that you can then transfer them to Iberia and then AA (or something like that? -- like  I said, it's confusing to me). We also have a lot of JetBlue flights here and we fly them a couple of times a year, so it would be really easy for me to transfer my Amex points straight to JetBlue instead, but I've read that the transfer rate isn't so great. Also, I'm Platinum on AA and would like to keep my mileage with them pretty high. So I guess I'm asking what you would do if you were in my shoes? 

Also, we do have 2 daily BA flights to London from here, so I could potentially use the Avios straight up if I accumulate enough of them, but then I would also have to pay BA's exorbitant fuel surcharges (sigh).

| Location/Date | Cash/Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
Costa Rica Feb 2018 | Hyatt free night along with some points and 50k Skypesos | My annual free hyatt night was coming to expiration. I really wanted to put it to full use at the Andaz in Costa Rica. Moved some UR over to make it a long weekend trip. Blew a bit more skypesos than I’d like but I really wanted to get away for Prez weekend. The Andaz was a beautiful property. The base forest room was really nice with a shower that opens up to the patio. Delicious mangos and really fun cocktail and ceviche class. Highly recommend people to burn their free night here. Love to come back.
March 2018-April 2018 Break | Break | Trip break, needed to focus on work and even with freeish flights/hotels, the cost does add up.
Hong Kong May 2018 | **75k Aeroplan Eva Air, 115k AA Cathay Pacific F** | After two months of no flying, I really wanted to get the hell away for Memorial Day weekend. CX F availability finally opened up from HKG-JFK. I really wanted to try out EVA Air J so this was perfect for 75k Aeroplan. Booked everything on a Monday, flew out on Thursday. Drank so much on Eva, that I didn’t even made my seat lie flat. I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in HK. The location couldn’t be more perfect. Easy to get around. My last night I blew my IHG free night at the Intercontinental HK due to a friend’s recommendation. Gorgeous fuckin lobby but the location was a bit further away and I felt like the rooms were a bit outdated. The bathroom was huge though. The main reason I went to HK, was to fly on CX F. I lounged hop all of CX’s lounges. The Pier and The Wing was best. Love the Cabanas tub/shower. The food was great. And wow the CX F seat was wide as fuck. Sleeping in it was so comfy too. Much more comfier than SQ Suites. I do think the tv monitor could use an update.
Cancun June 2018 | 2 free hyatt night, 25k hyatt | My bro had his hyatt night’s expiration coming and so I moved my points over to make it 3 nights. Took him to Hyatt Ziva Cancun. I honestly really like this property better than Zilara. All the kids there don’t really bother. So much more food options. I think I gained an extra 10 lbs with all the food I ate. Would come back here instead of Zilara. Blew some Delta gc and Jetblue points to get/leave CUN.
Chicago June 2018 | 6k Jetblue, free Hyatt Stay | This was an extremely spur of the moment trip for me. One of chefs I follow, Wagyumafia was having a pop up in Chicago. I flew out on a Saturday morning to Chicago, dined with him at 1am, flew out the next morning. Stayed at the Hyatt The Loop. Got a corner room, huge ass room. Def recommend this hotel. Forgot how much points I paid for this.
Jordan and Egypt July 2018 | 25k Merrill, BA Avois, Cash flight | Went on this trip with some churning friends. Found a great cash deal from CAI-JFK on Air Italty’s converted old Qatar planes for $500. Booked using my Merrill(I love you). I knew if I wanted to do Egypt, I needed to do Petra, Jordan as well. Got a cash flight to Jordan. We spent a couple days in Jordan and did Petra, Wadi Rum and Crown Plaza Dead Sea. Highly recommended it. Spent a night in Sun City Camp in their Martian Bubble Tent. The stars were beautiful. Dead Sea was nice and holy shit did it burned all our eyes. We used Avois to get to AMM-CAI, forgot how much. Egypt isn’t my favorite place but seeing the Pyramids in person was nice. Air Italy’s J seat wasn’t bad at all but not really to write about.
San Diego July 2018 | Delta Companion Cert | My yearly trek to SDCC. Used my delta companion cert with a friend. Tamed SDCC year due to no Marvel Studios or GoT. 
Buenos Aires August 2018 | **48k Skypesos**, 20k Park Hyatt | I didn’t get a chance to make it to South America last year in my travels so I had to make up for it. Months ago, Delta had a flash sale for South America. I could not resist. Nice getaway from the humid NYC Weather but man I did not expect it to be that cold in BA. Stayed at the Milhouse Hostel, a great party hostel, shitty beds. All my dorm mates were making fun of me cause I went out to eat steak almost every night. My last night, I booked Park Hyatt Buenos Aires because I could not turn down a chance to stay at a Palace. The PH BA has two buildings, the palace and the tower. Roomed at the tower with a corner view of the Palace. They offered me a room with twin beds and asked they can make it a king bed, wtf? What they really did was just push the two beds together which ended up even better because it was wide as fuck. Ended missing my flight out due to traffic but luckily I had enough avois in my account to book on AA the next night out. Burned 30k IHG for a night stay at the Intercontinental. Room felt outdated but whatever, I needed a room for the night and it was free. Went back to the hostel party and club afterwards and flew out the next night.



- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends. Except for Buenos Aires, spend 10 days there a bit long for me.
- 6 trips in the last 4 months was fun. 
- How much points do I have left? Idk, I know its over a million across the board but under 2 million. Still got 400k UR, 340k AA, 300k MR off the top of my head.



The next trip I have booked is St. Regis Maldives again in Feb 2018. Managed to catch the 340k marriott during the merge. Was hoping to go this year since I’m Plat due to the Ritz for free breakfast but Feb will give me a longer time to save money. How to get there? Idk yet. 

Really hoping to fit a long weekend in Tokyo before the year’s end."

I checked United MCO-AKL flights and it shows that the cost with First and Polaris is 800K points for 2 people - is that too much?.. ANA doesn't show any availability. Am I doing something wrong?"

Is there an avenue for selling this credit?

76,San Juan trip in January,7,d7wijq,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/d7wijq/san_juan_trip_in_january/,8,2019-09-23 01:04:32,"My partner and I are going on a cruise in January that departs from San Juan on 1/4, returning 1/14.   We booked the cruise in cash via Costco Travel (very happy with the deal we got there), but we now need airfare and pre-cruise hotel.  I have some options but I'd love to know if there's something better.  I have \~100K each Chase UR points and AMEX points, and \~75K CapitalOne points.  Gold Status with United and Marriot, but not many points banked in either.

**Flights**

RT travel PHL -> SJU, 1/3/2020, returning 1/14/2020.  2 people, economy is fine.  

Outbound flights appear to be \~double the cost of return flights.

AA is hubbed in PHL and flies direct, \~$560 cash -> 76K Chase points via Chase travel.  I don't have enough AA points to book through them directly, and I don't know of any way to transfer in.

BA only offers reward flights for the return, non-direct (8h vs 3.5h) for 36K Avios total = \~25K MR points at current rates.  Then I could book the outbound leg via Chase points for \~48K, total price 73K.  That helps me use some MR points (which I've been having difficulty doing) but is a much crappier return flight.

I can't find any United Saver availability, and JetBlue and Delta would each take close to 100K points for the trip.  SW doesn't fly there on our dates.

Short answer, I think I need to book with Chase UR points.  I know the 1.5 cent value isn't the best I can get, but I don't think I can do any better on this trip.

&#x200B;

**Hotel**

Marriott has one Category 3 hotel in San Juan, a Courtyard, which is bookable for 17.5K points, or 14K Amex points with the current transfer bonus.  The hotel is currently booking for $250 per night, which seems par for other hotels in downtown San Juan.  This seems like a slam dunk - anybody see any downsides?"

We could do December 24 - January 3 as an alternative. 

We are basically open to travel anywhere (Europe, Puerto Rico, caribbean, etc) and are looking for suggestions based on the points we have etc. What will make the most sense, fun, etc. 

Based on initial research it looks like Colombia could be the best option. It will cost $900 roundtrip from IAD to MDE (Medellin). Domestic travel within Colombia is cheap. $70 one way from MDE to Cartagena. Using points for this trip looks like a massive rip off, with Delta wanting 120k points roundtrip from IAD to Cartagena, and United having black out dates for January 2-3. 

Another potential option would be for us to fly to Ft. Lauderdale, relax for a few days around Miami, and then fly to Havana from Ft Lauderdale. The roundtrip flight from Ft. lauderdale to Havana is only about $400. I don't know how spending NYE in Havana will be however...

With that being said, it does NOT have to be colombia, but I have looked around the Caribbean, Europe, and South America, and everything looks to be a tremendous rip-off. When using points, I think I would be open to anything that is about 50-70k points for roundtrip. I still want to get relatively good value on my points. Otherwise I don't mind using cash, but again, I am looking for the best bargain.

My points:
Cap One - 44k AA - 34k UR - 140k AMEX MR - 122k Hilton - 97k Delta - 64k Marriott - 11k United - 73k Barclaycard - 46k JetBlue - 3k

81,Favorite uses of SPG points?,3,526dpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/526dpn/favorite_uses_of_spg_points/,8,2016-09-11 05:52:25,"After having met the minimum spends on both the SPG Personal 35k and SPG Business 35k, I'm sitting on 78k SPG points. I don't plan on earning anymore since they're so hard to earn and the bonuses are once per lifetime, and since the program may go away in the next couple years I figure I would run down my balance.

However, SPG points are the most valuable points currency in the world and I'm almost scared to use them. I've been doing a bit of research and I think some of the best hotel redemptions I've seen are at their lower end hotels...

The Aloft Cancun, for example, is a mid-range hotel in a prime location near all the luxury beach all-inclusive resorts (Ziva, Zilara, etc) in Cancun and rates can approach $200 a night at this hotel. As a Category 2 property, however, they require only 4,000 points a night, or 3,000 on the weekends. That can be 5+ cents per point in value!

JAL, a unique transfer partner of SPG, offers some great promotions, such as 30,000 miles roundtrip to Brazil on oneworld partner TAM. Given that roundtrips to Brazil from NYC are currently about $1,500 in economy, and you only need to transfer 25,000 SPG points to get 30,000 JAL miles, that's a value of 6 cents per point... 

I know a lot of people liked to transfer to Alaska for good redemptions in J/F on Emirates, but recent devaluations made this less appealing... if there are still good uses for transferring to Alaska, I'd like to hear about it...

If you were able to get in on the Virgin America+JetBlue points match promotion, then you could have gotten 50,000 Virgin America miles matched to 75,000 JetBlue miles for the cost of just 40,000 SPG points...

Even if you missed out on the Virgin America/JetBlue promotion, Virgin America has some great partner redemptions like 40k roundtrip in economy (35k SPG points) or 80k roundtrip (65k SPG points) roundtrip LAX-SYD on Virgin Australia...

I've heard about some great SPG Moments... but never really found one that I would want to use my precious SPG points for.

What else do you like using SPG points for that really sets it apart from other programs?"

* Large stash of UR, Hyatt points, United Miles, Jetblue Miles
* Looking to stay at an all-inclusive for 5-6 nights

My Plan:

1) My plan is to fly out of YYZ as I don't think there are direct flights out of any of the others.  I don't want to risk connecting flights in the winter (also, ROC and BUF are more likely to have delays due to lake effect snow). 

2) Using United Miles on Air Canada seems like the best bet for flights (at 35k per person round trip).  Does anyone see a better value?

3) I would book a suite at the Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall.  I believe it would cost 12.5k additional per night for the 5yo and the 2yo would be free.  Is this right?

4) Anyone who has been to Rose Hall Ziva or Zilara, will I have any issue with my children on the shuttle to resort RE: Car Seats?

I said fine, and now I'm trying to figure out how to plan my flight. 


For me, I'd like to pick her up in Korea at least and go to Osaka with her on the same flight (or at least the same time). I have 190k UR, 13k Korean Air, 50k jetblue. CSR card. My airport is LAX.


I originally thought about an open jaw korean air so I'd do an Lax->Inc->Osaka-> Lax, but turns out there's no direct Korean air flight from Osaka to LAX and I'd have to go through Incheon again which I'd rather avoid.
Maybe I should do one way Lax->inc->osaka korean air and then another airline from osaka->LAX? 


Not to mention my mother, in which I think the best plan would be to just get a roundtrip Peach flight from Gimpo/ Incheon to Osaka and back. 



I'm going mad, any advice helpful."

I don't really have a preferred airline, I guess what I'm struggling with is what points are worth.

I like the idea of using the Citi Prestige travel credit, but I could just buy a Southwest gift card to finish it for this year and I'll inevitably use it on fees (eventually).  I fly out of BOS typically (sometimes MHT) - also difficult to decide because I don't know what my future travel plans will be.

Trying to redeem four seats on Hawaiian  from KOA to HNL on 16 March using American miles.

Is this a glitch in AA website? Or is Hawaiian blocking award space for these dates? I can see multiple Hawaiian flights operating on these days. I can also see award space on United but I want to redeem American miles. Why would only certain days not be available for redeeming?

Any advise on a workaround? We are all set for our dream Hawaiian vacation (we have never been) but this is really hindering us. If I can't make AA work then what are my other options? Can't use UA.

Thanks for being such a helpful community - have learned a lot from you all.

We are based in NYC, so we have the luxury of being able to fly out of JFK, EWR, or LGA.

**Trip 1**

We would like to visit **Banff** and **Lake Louise**, since all the pictures we've seen are absolutely breathtaking. [[1],](https://images.trvl-media.com/hotels/1000000/20000/13700/13652/13652_81_z.jpg)[ [2]](https://images.trvl-media.com/media/content/shared/images/travelguides/Lake-Louise-10115-smalltabletRetina.jpg).

 - I am thinking that we fly into YYC, and rent a car to drive out to Banff (~1.5 hrs).
 - All of the flights seem to get in later in the day, so we will probably stay for one evening in **Calgary** (hotels seem relatively cheap, probably can do points + cash at a hyatt/ihg)
 - I’d really like to go here in **May**, because I love to golf and their [course](http://www.fairmont.com/banff-springs/golf/) looks awesome. (My SO does not golf, but I'm sure she'll do a yoga class or visit the spa).
 - Seattle had also been in our sites, although I hear it's rather expensive once you're there. Nonetheless, I'd love to take the ferry around to the different islands, and rent a car to visit **Olympic National Park** and **Mt. Rainier**. I'd originally wanted to do a quick trip out here back in March, but realized it's best to see these parks in the warmer months. 
 - This trip would most likely be for 7-8 days, or just 4 if we only go to Canada.

Originally I was thinking to book the flights to Calgary through American (**30k each roundtrip**), but some of connections are a little ridiculous (SEA + LAX in the return to NYC…)

 - Cash tickets are also only ~**$350-375**, so **1.1-1.2 cpm** isn't that great.
 - Thinking it would be better to book through **Alaska** using cash and the **companion pass***, but am not sure if I can book a multi-day layover in Seattle.

**We'd love to go to Hawaii, and realize this is probably the best use of the Alaska companion pass. However, Hawaii is extremely expensive, and we feel we'd enjoy our time better there in a few years when we have a little more money.*


**Trip 2**

We'd also really like to go to Southeast Asia, and see **Bangkok**, **Phuket**, **Saigon**, and **Singapore**. Looks beautiful, and it all seems relatively cheap once you’re there. 

 - I’d like to hit Bangkok for 1-2 days (have a friend teaching there, so i'd like to pay him that visit I’ve been promising him.
 - Some other places we’d like to see are **Phang Nga Bay** and **Pattaya**, **Ko Samui**, **Phuket**, and **Ko Phi Phi** (really touristy, but so beautiful)
 - For this trip we’d be able to go for **10-15 days**, the hotels are all really cheap so this saves us a lot.
 - I am weary of the rain starting to pick up (May-Aug seems bad), so we’d like to do this trip ASAP
 
Seems we'd need to fly into HKG, PEK, NRT, or SIN to get a flight to BKK or HKT.  Another option is take Qatar and transfer through DOH. 

  - I heard you can’t do much on a layover in NRT, so we’d rather transfer through SIN or even HKG (and maybe do a day trip).
  - It seems each leg is **40k** on United, so that would be **160k** between the two of us...
  - This seems like a really bad redemption, as I’m seeing flights for 650-700 round trip (0.8 cpm).
  - The only way I could justify it, was if we got some sweet open jaws that allow us to visit SIN, BKK, HKT, and/or SGN on the same ticket, but idk if that’s possible


A friend who’s been living/teaching in Korea suggested scrapping Thailand and just going to **Bali**, so I was wondering if anyone had any input on awards flights there.  I've researched the destination and agree it's awesome, but it may need to wait for another time.  Would be nice to do some sort of open-jaw/extended layover in **SIN** or **SYD** with a connection to **DPS**, but not sure if this is possible.

**Other Ideas**

Part of us wants to see the world while were young, and another part just wants some nice R&R. We used our two free nights at the Hyatt Regency in Aruba and had a ***blast***. We paid ~$500 in advance to book a third night, but were upgraded to an room oceanfront room that goes for $650/night! We made some newb mistakes like forgetting sunscreen ($15 in gift shop…), but overall it was a great time!

 Another trip we were considering was flying into Cancun and staying at the [**Fairmont Mayakoba**](http://www.fairmont.com/mayakoba-riviera-maya/). Flights to CUN are really cheap (especially on JetBlue), and we could get lucky using the room + suite upgrades. I saw generally good reviews on FT, and there’s also a PGA [golf course](http://www.mayakobagolf.com/course.html) next door… I am not sure if we’d do an all inclusive here (5 nights is a lot), but we may stay for 2 nights and see if we can get a suite upgrade. The other days we rent a car to visit Tulum, and maybe backtrack and stay a night in Cancun.

*Yet another* trip is **Costa Rica**, but this also does not seem like a good place to use miles/points. We could fly in relatively cheaply to Liberia or San Jose (JetBlue has great deals to LIB), and can get around to the different destinations via [Nature Air ](http://www.natureair.com/) (flight + sight seeing in one). 
We would go to the Arenal Volcano Area, but also have also heard Manuel Antonio National Park is really cool as well.  This place looks awesome, but there seems like so much to hit. I don’t mind faring towards the more touristy areas, I heard some parts of the country don’t have paved roads and you could kill a whole day in traffic/getting lost. I’d love to do some all inclusive travel tour that takes care of all that stress for you, but the price is out of our budget for now.


**Final Note**

I realize this post is really long, and probably not the best organized, so thank you for reading it. I don't want to be one of those people who collects points and never uses them, but I also don't want to waste them. It's my understanding the real value is in business/first, but I also hope there's value to be had in economy/coach.

**Edit**

I am aware of close-in booking fees, and too my knowledge the changing the date trick doesn't work anymore (except maybe for Untied?). This is *yet another* reason why cash might be better for Asia, but any input is greatly appreciated!"

This is the first time I will be redeeming reward points and I am in a bit of a dilemma. I would greatly appreciate any help. 

I have PTO planned for 17 days from 9/30/16 to 10/16/16. This vacation can move up a week to 10/6/16 to 10/23/16 if needed, however I wanted to make sure I get Columbus day in there as a Federal Holiday. 

I've been looking at flights and the reward flights suck getting to Lima. 

On 9/30, there is a 10:30am - 11:30am flight from DCA to Lima on JetBlue using 18.9k points + $20 fees. This flight is $320 out of pocket. *I would be transferring my Amex points to JetBlue*

On 10/16 - there is a 8am-9pm flight on AA using 17.5k points. I think this is a great deal. 

So getting to Lima is the problem. I waste an entire PTO day on Friday because of the flight time. There is an attractive option on Thursday to fly from 6:30pm -5:30am (arrive Friday morning) from AA, but AA is pricing that flight at 50k reward points. 

So I really have two options:

1) Pay $608 out of pocket for AA round trip for Thursday 6:30pm-5:30am (Friday morning) - this way I gain the entire Friday and it won't be wasted. 
- I have a $600 negative balance on my AA platinum card, so I could put the charge on there.
2) Use 18.9k JetBlue points (Transferred from Amex) and 17.5k AA points, and lose out on most of all of Friday. By the time I get from Lima Airport to my hostel, it will be midnight...

Points totals:
Amex - 150k
Delta - 60k
AA - 57k (but soon should be 82k after they credit me from AA gold card)
United - 75k
Chase Ultimate - 27k

Thanks for all the help in advance!

I go to NYC once a month and have been mainly using UR points until I got the Amex Plat bonus. Despite the MR having lower cpp, the UR seems more ""valuable"" to me since there is more flexibility and higher redemption through their travel portals. 

MR only transfers to Delta and Jetblue (250:200). UR transfers to Delta, Southwest and United. UR portal redeems at 1.5 cpp and MR portal redeems at 1.0 cpp. 

With this in mind, should I use my UR points for better redemption or use my MR points for lesser redemption to conserve my more ""valuable"" UR points?

United has no availability on anything in premium, Delta is charging an obscene amount, and AA has no saver availability so UR –> Avios is out. JetBlue has award and revenue availability for the SFO-JFK leg in mint, but we have no JetBlue miles, no way to earn them quickly, and the cash price is a bit high right now.

Can someone please let me know what would be the best flight award redemption to go to any of those places? And if it is possible, to use points in between for flights to the originating Asian country to the second Asian country? I don't mind using USD to pay for flights between Asian countries, but if there are good redemptions, I would love to use that. 

If there is a super cheap redemption to an Asian country, I don't mind checking that country out either. I'm very flexible and just open to new cultures/countries.

I'm kind of new to travel awards and I need some help to figure this out. I was hoping to find a good deal but I haven't been lucky so far, like I have in the previous years. I currently have 300K UR points.

These are my flights:

* **#1:** 12/23 Boston (BOS) -> Phoenix (PHX) -> $493 (American)
* **#2:** 1/1 Phoenix (PHX) -> Denver (DEN) -> $119 (Southwest)
* **#3:** 1/4 Denver (DEN) -> Boston (BOS) -> $185 (Jetblue)

**Total: $797 (x2 for my wife - ouch!!).**

Let's break it down:

* 1) This flight is the most expensive of the 3. Way more than I have ever paid! The UR's website has the same flight for the same price of buying directly from American but it's also offering 33K points for it. I would use 66k points (me + wife) for it, instead of $986. I personally think it's much, right? What do you guys think?

* 2) This one could be cheaper, but it's ok. Southwest offers the same flight for 7K points (compared to $119). I have 4k with Southwest and my wife has 9K, so I would only have to transfer 3K points from my UR to Southwest. We don't mind using the points we have with Southwest for this trip, and 3K from my UR doesn't seem to much. Is this worth it?!?

* 3) Finally the last flight. UR's website is offering the flight for 12K points (compared to $185). Is this worth it?!?


I might be wrong, but I don't think it's worth spending 66K points on the first flight. But I could spend 3K on the flight #2 (and compliment with existing points in our Southwest accounts) and maybe (depending on what you guys say) another 24K for the flight #3.

Ideas? Suggestions? What should I do?? 

Thank you so much for your help.

This is a semi-award/semi-churning post but I figured the main question belongs here. Goal is to take the SO on a trip to San Juan. We'll be leaving from NYC and want to know what the best way to get there via points is. 

Based on my research so far, I'm thinking either Jetblue or AA is our best bet for non-stop flights (which would be ideal). With Jetblue's program we would pay about 44000pts+fees for 2xroundtrip in mid july whereas for AA (booked with avios) we would pay 40000+fees. Our dates are pretty flexible; anytime in July but only July. The nice thing about Jetblue is that if there is a seat available, you can get it whereas there aren't many award seats left on AA. 

Assuming I can meet the minspend in the 1st month, should I go for Amex PRG and transfer pts to jetblue or maybe go for the chase BA and book thru avios? What is award availability for SJU routes on AA/BA like in the summer? Any other thoughts on award travel JFK-SJU?

I currently have the following cards:

Chase SWA with 35000pts

Barclays A+ working towards min spend

Citi AA plat select just approved 


I have kinda earmarked the AA points for a different trip so I wanted to add one more card as I mentioned above (obviously what I have now wouldn't get me too far)."

3. Spirit cash fare for $779 total plus all the fees in the world.  I am rather against this.

My family is going to NYC this Spring (from April 5 thru April 15 or 16). The first part of our trip will have to be LA to NY (we already have tickets to Hamilton on April 7). Beyond NYC, part of our wishlist is to see Niagara Falls and then head over to Toronto (train perhaps, or take a short commuter flight from JFK or LGA or EWR).... continue on to Toronto (spend a 2-3 days or so) then fly back to LA (either from Toronto, or from Buffalo, or other suggested airports).

Current points balance
UR - 125K
TYP - 80K
MR - 130K

I checked JetBlue, and I believe they have $54 one-way flights from JFK to Buffalo. I have not ruled out renting a van and drive upstate, I'm just not a big fan of driving over 400 miles. Train-wise, Amtrak quoted me around $305 for 6 passengers (an 8-hour train ride). Could possibly be a great experience, not exactly sure what scenery we will see from Manhattan to Buffalo. Or would it better to fly (for instance with JetBlue - total $318 for 6 of us. We will not be checking in any luggage, we travel with carry ons only.

Just not exactly sure what combination of awards I can use to help us get back to LAX. We could fly back out of Toronto, or I would it be cheaper to fly back from Buffalo?"

I live in Chicago and sitting at home, so I don't need a hotel. But my Saturday is ruined already (arrive at 5am in the morning instead of 11pm). 
What is the best way to handle this with company? Should I expect another flight or ask for some sort of compensation here? Delay is due to weather and previous flight, (6 pm flight is delayed too), so it's combination of both(was told that by rep).

154,Frustrated by Amtrak Guest Rewards,6,4k2ioj,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4k2ioj/frustrated_by_amtrak_guest_rewards/,3,2016-05-19 17:44:54,"Ever since Chase lost Amtrak as a UR transfer partner (coinciding with Amtrak switching to a revenue-based rather than zone-based award system), I've really been missing the ability to take quick trips from NYC to DC, PHL, or BOS using my points.

I'm considering signing up for the two Bank of America cards which offer 20,000 and 12,000 Amtrak points respectively, but I'm concerned about how Amtrak has redeveloped its award program.

They advertise 'no blackout dates', but this seems to be a false promise. For example, when looking for a train from NY Penn to Washington, DC on 9/2, which is admittedly around Labor Day (peak travel period), there are tons of redemptions that are listed as 'No Price', meaning no award availability: http://i.imgur.com/JI9hwwV.jpg They are not sold out, however, plenty of revenue fares are still available: http://i.imgur.com/cOmd2VK.jpg

I was under the impression that one of the points [no pun intended] of a revenue-based frequent rider program (like JetBlue and Southwest) is that as long as there is a seat available on the flight, you can book it with points, it's just that peak period and expensive revenue tickets will cost more points. Seeing dates four months away with 'no availability' on a revenue-based frequent rider program seems ridiculous to me.

For the 'No Price' redemptions, Amtrak says:

>""No Price"" is displayed for Redemption Booking
>
>During peak travel periods when demand is high and capacity is limited, some departures are available at a higher point cost and some seats or classes of service may not be available for redemption. Amtrak Guest Rewards members with Select Plus(SM) and Select Executive status may find expanded access to use their points for travel during those peak times. For best results, we recommend members log in to their Amtrak Guest Rewards account before searching for available itineraries.

So it seems that they are blacking out certain trains for non-elite members, which is ridiculous on a revenue-based frequent rider program. If I want to spend more points for a more expensive ticket, what's the problem?

I plan on getting 6 one way tickets from Buffalo, NY to LAX on April 15 (currently available)....and if paid in cash = $942. If paid using the current MR to JB ratio, the one way will cost us 10,600 pts/person or 63,600 JB points + $33.60. I'll be using 80K MR in order for me to get 64K JB points.This flight would be a DIRECT FLIGHT.

The other option I thought about transferring UR to Southwest as well. The # of points needed/person is 10,340/person or 62,040 UR points + $33.60. This is NOT A DIRECT FLIGHT. 

I also checked another option since we will also be visiting Toronto. If we do a one way from YYZ to LAX  (direct flight) = 75,000 Aeroplan miles + $734 CAD. 

I also tried American Airlines from YYZ to LAX (direct flight) = 150,000 AA points + $285.

I'm leaning towards the JB option (because it's a direct flight), and I also tend to value UR points more. I might have answered my own question, and I think writing it down helped me rationalize things.

So the issue is (and I knew this going in) is that Jetblue only flies to BOS and JFK from my airport. And I don't have plans to go to either of those places anytime soon. I have used some of the points already to book a trip for my parents and they paid me a cent per point. I'm happy to keep them on tap, and getting a cent per is fantastic, but I've been thinking about liquidating them a little sooner. 

I have a business class booking on Aeroplan that I'm planning on making soonish, and I'm 39k miles short.

I have never used any of the minimal points that I've saved up and don't know where to start other than using google flights.  Hoping someone can help me find flights to visit my sister in Indonesia.

* 1 round trip ticket for only myself
* Seating class doesn't matter
* Departing NYC: 12/21 (kind of flexible on that, but wanted to arrive ahead of Christmas Eve)
* Departing Indonesia ahead of 1/5

American (OneWorld): 91,300
JetBlue (TrueBlue): 42,800

I know that my minimal points won't cover the entire trip and I will have to pay some amount of out pocket.  Also realize I'm flying over a major holiday and that can make it more difficult.

I have ~200K UR points, 50K US Airlines miles, ~100K southwest. 
 
My plan is for myself and my SO to fly into SJO around 3/17/15, stay a week to attend a wedding, then fly to LIM for another couple of weeks.  

So far my research suggests that getting ourselves from SMF, or SFO to PHX which is a ""sweet spot"" for using Avois miles and then being able to book for 12.5K Avois miles, but I'm having difficulty actually figuring out if this actually will work, and the SJO-LIM seems to be the hiccup.  I used this as a guide: http://travelisfree.com/2013/06/18/best-use-ba-avios/

I'm also considering that maybe United is the way to go as the Star Alliance Route Map shows SFO-LIM stopping at SJO after routing through Chicago, and LAX-LIM through SJO.  Does anyone have any input or experience with this or a similar plan? Thanks for any input. 

**TL:DR**

* 200K UR points, various other SW, US and JetBlue points.
* Flying from CA (SMF, SFO, LAX?) to LIM (or other Peruvian airport)
* Stopover in Costa Rica for a week (SJO or LIB) 
* Timeframe: Middle of March
* Current Plan: Either SMF to PHX and Avois miles from there or Star Alliance flight with Stop Over in SJO (~40K miles)

Dates: 10/3 - 10/20 (+/- a few days) 
Needs: 2 tickets (my wife, my 2 year old, and a lap infant, but my ticket will be reimbursed by work)  
Class: economy 
The Bhutan Ticket will be purchased as a separate RT ticket KTM--Paro 

I like the BOS--KTM Emirates flight and the BOS--KTM Qatar airlines flight. 

This is what I have: 
320,000 UR Points 
50,000 American miles 
75,000 Delta skypesos
10,000 JetBlue miles 
(62,000 United miles - but need to pay $250 to get them reinstated, as an aside is this worth it ?) 

I am not in need of using points for these Nepal flights but maximizing the value of my UR points is a priority. so if that means buying these Nepal tickets no problem and using UR points through the portal at a later time - that's fine. 

To me the best options by itinerary are these one stop options:
1.) Emirates (short layover in Dubai, PP lounge) 
2.) Qatar (long layover in Doha, would require a hotel) 

Emirates doesn't appear in the chase portal and Qatar airlines does but not a good itinerary (longer layover). 

Questions:

If I purchase Emirates or Qatar airlines can i earn miles in a partner that's useful to me ? Or are miles earned at such a low rate it's not worth considering ? 

**Is there some transfer of miles I'm missing that would allow me to purchase the Emirates or Qatar ticket at a rate better than the standard Chase UR discount ? **

Thanks so much for reading!! Any tips are welcome.

awardhacker has flights on american airlines in economy for 35k rountrip and business for 55k roundtrip. The route should be JFK - SJU - EIS. Anyone with experience booking this route?

It looks like AA does not have direct flights to SJU from JFK when searching individual segments on the AA website. I have thought about doing a jetblue award flight (obtaining 3k jetblue miles is not a problem) for 2 people from JFK to SJU for 52,000 JBLU points (around 1.56 cpp). Then calling in to book AA partner flight on seaborne from SJU to EIS for 2 people roundtrip for a total of 30,000 AA miles, would like to use up my AA miles.

Seaborne flight BB4588 departs SJU at 12:45 PM, arrives at 1:30PM at EIS

Return:Seaborne flight BB4514 departs EIS at 3:25 PM, arrives at 4:10PM at SJU
Jetblue Flight 1804 7:21PM departure from SJU, arrive at 10:27PM at JFK

How troublesome is it transferring between two airlines on one trip? Any concerns with the timing of the connecting flights?

I have seen commonly that people will fly into St thomas and it is a PITA to travel from there to EIS where the scrub island ferry will pick you up. I am trying to minimize the transfers reasonably.

Any tips on 7 nights in BVI would also be appreciated. Counting on ""breakfast amenity"" since program merger will go through of SPG and Marriott and I have platinum status.

Also, if anyone has any insight on what is the best way to book a flight from LAX to JFK, depart December 14, 2018, returning December 23, 2018 with the least amount of points, it would be appreciated. I am seeing some availability on the 14th for 12.5k points through airfrance, but remember reading some time ago air france will freeze accounts with no other activity on them. The problem I'm seeing is availability going back to LAX.
