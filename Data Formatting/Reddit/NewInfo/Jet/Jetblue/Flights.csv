0,Advice on which rewards plan/airline to utilize,4,9crzp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/9crzp1/advice_on_which_rewards_planairline_to_utilize/,14,2018-09-04 07:23:40,"Hello,

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

Now that I have a better job, I dont *have* to fly Spirit.

Side note: Expedia doesn't even list JetBlue as an option when I tried to book a flight earlier which is weird. Only saw AA, Delta, & United yet when I went to JetBlues site, I found the flight I wanted."

I booked some flights that are scheduled for late November, but now--due to some customs/immigration complications--we probably won't be able to make it, as there is a possibility that my SO could get refused entry to the US.

Has anyone had experience getting a refund from either Orbitz or JetBlue--or any airline for that matter? The fares purchased were marked as ""non-refundable"", but it seems preposterous when the flight is still 4 months out.

Anyhow is my money for these flights as good as gone, or is there any hope in kicking up a fuss with customer service?


Thanks!

The trip is about 3 months out.  JetBlue had nonstop options, good times, and decent prices.  However, once I settled on the dates and times, the prices kept creeping higher.  The travel wiki and other sites say to setup a price tracker 3 months out and watch for a price you feel comfortable with.  They claim that the price often rises, but falls back as the dates get closer.  

Help me not panic that I missed the best deal.  So far, the best times and dates for us have risen by $500 total.  Also, since JetBlue doesn't really have a deal for round trip, should I grab the return flight now that it is at a good price and monitor just the outgoing flight price?  Worst case I'd have to pay the higher fare if it doesn't go down or starts filling up.

I know you can't predict the fares, but should I just trust that prices are likely to drop again?  I mean, who goes to Florida in August anyway?"

I’m a fairly inexperienced flyer and have a flight booked for Friday 3/23 and want to make sure I have a grasp on how it works. 


I am flying CLT-BOS on Jet Blue and then BOS-DUB on Aer Lingus. I booked my ticket through Aer Lingus. When I arrive at Charlotte Airport I will check in with Jet Blue, but will they provide my Aer Lingus boarding pass as well? Or can I check in for both flights online?


And then coming from DUB to BOS, will Aer Lingus in Dublin provide my Jet Blue boarding pass for BOS-CLT or will I need to check in to Jet Blue separately? Our layover in BOS is only 2 hrs and I don’t see how we would get a Jet Blue boarding pass before flying home to CLT.

Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed.
Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.
Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts. Not from a morality stand point, thank you; I can make that decision myself and don't need the internet's thoughts on right and wrong. I'd like to hear if anybody knows how this will play out.

Current plan for this year is to fly into Phoenix and drive to the ski areas in southern Colorado. This would be sometime in mid march. Just in general, I'm wondering if it would be better to A.

Return Dec. 13 from Kharkiv to Istanbul, Istanbul to Boston on Turkish. Then I take a JetBlue from Boston to Pittsburgh. 

I call Turkish, they tell me to book online to save $50. I hang up, try to book through Turkish website, it's $3002. So I call back and talk to another woman. She now says that Turkish can't book the JetBlue flights. So I call JetBlue, they say to book through a travel agent.

So why does Google Flights give me this option as a 1-ticket trip? Is Turkish lying, or is Google lying? Is there any other options?

36,How strict is JetBlue with pet carrier size?,0,9bqfrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/9bqfrw/how_strict_is_jetblue_with_pet_carrier_size/,2,2018-08-31 08:07:28,"I’m moving my cat across the country in a few weeks! Which, is stressful enough to begin with. I have a soft-sided carrier for her, but the height dimension is about 2.5” taller than what’s on the JetBlue website. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Will I be okay because the carrier can “squish” a little bit?

Thanks for any help and for making my upcoming move a little less stressful!"

39,Bit of a hard question here...what happens if a flight is canceled due to weather and the next connecting is with a different airline?,0,97epxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/97epxc/bit_of_a_hard_question_herewhat_happens_if_a/,1,2018-08-15 06:45:11,"TLDR; I booked a flight with 2 connections the first flight, from Boston to Mexico city is with JetBlue, the 2 connecting flights after are with LATAM. Since these flights will be during the winter, and sometimes the winters up here in the northeast can get wild, and snow can fall once a week, I was wondering what would happen to my flight if my first flight with JetBlue got canceled because of weather conditions.

Long story; I had one flight before that had to be delayed because of a snow shower that happened the night before the flight. Gladly I had enough time during the layover to get to my next flight and didn't have to get anything rebooked but either way I was flying with 1 airline not with multiple airlines. 

So let's say it snows the day of my flight and they have to send me on the next possible plane or send me the day after. What would happen to my next 2 flights that are with LATAM? As it would be LATAM's responsibility had that flight been a LATAM flight, would there be a way to get my other 2 flights rebooked since it wouldn't be LATAM'S responsibility?"
40,Help needed with the incoming storm [Noreaster],2,5z63al,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/5z63al/help_needed_with_the_incoming_storm_noreaster/,1,2017-03-13 20:48:14,"Hi guys. My fiancée is due to leave today from RDU in NC to JFK, then to LIS (Portugal), then to ORY (France).

She's flying with JetBlue from RDU to JFK, then TAP from JFK to France via Portugal. We booked the flights as ""one itinerary"" so they are all classed as connecting flights, to my understanding. We booked everything with TAP.

JetBlue just emailed us and said the first flight is cancelled due to the weather. I phoned JetBlue and they said ""our system is down, we can't help you, you booked entirely with TAP; go to them"". Their online function is broken to change flights.

I phoned TAP and they said ""well our flights aren't cancelled, that's your problem if Jetblue cancels"" - even though we booked entirely through TAP.

I have absolutely, no idea where to start. I'm in JetBlue's 30 minute+ telephone queue right now, any advice urgently would be appreciated on what to do here.

Edit: JetBlue have pushed our flights back a day. I made this post in a bit of a panic. The storm may well last until tomorrow however. I'll keep this post updated for anyone who's interested."
41,JetBlue lost bag. What should I be expecting/do?,8,cyb6ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/cyb6ns/jetblue_lost_bag_what_should_i_be_expectingdo/,1,2019-09-01 19:18:36,"Arrived at baggage claim, but my bag was not there. The JetBlue rep I spoke too wasn’t sure if my bag left my departure point or not. It’s also possible it was stolen. Hopefully it turns up soon, but it was a huge duffel bag with virtually all my clothes in it, upwards of $400-$500 worth of clothes. Almost none of that am I going to have receipts for. I think there’s fairly generous compensation just for the bag being delayed, but if it never turns up, do I have any shot of being compensated for the lost clothing?"

I was wondering if anyone perhaps had any insight on whether something like that is coming around anytime within the next week or two? 

Hopefully this is the appropriate place for such a question. Thanks in advance. "
