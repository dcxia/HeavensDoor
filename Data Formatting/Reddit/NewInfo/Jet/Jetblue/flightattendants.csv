0,Looking for advice from flight attendants,12,ba1inn,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/ba1inn/looking_for_advice_from_flight_attendants/,18,2019-04-06 10:21:07,"Hi flight attendants of reddit
I’ve been browsing this subreddit daily for a while. I’m not a flight attendant, but I started following because I developed a crazy fear of planes around two years ago.  I’m afraid I’m of crashing, but also probably more afraid of sudden extreme turbulence.  The fear is irrational and totally came out of nowhere.

Flight attendants have always been really good to me.  Last year I was flying back from Norway, and (I didn’t know it) I was having my first hypomanic/manic episode. I was having a really hard time and the flight attendants just let me sit on the floor in the back of the plane.

I flew to Portland from the Bay Area last week and did fine. But this summer I’ll be flying JetBlue to New York for the first time by myself, and I am probably flying Bay Area to Lima a few months after that.

The irony of this all is that I’m a mechanical engineer.

Any reassuring advice from you all would be greatly appreciated, it already helps quite a bit to think that there are people who do this as a career and fly multiple times per day and don’t die.

Thank you for all of your hard work and for making flying better for people who are irrationally scared. "

I've got a question, are my numbers way off, and if they aren't, how do you all do it? Some flight attendants buy their own homes and I don't understand how that is possible. Anyway, best!

The largest difference is definitely how AA is legacy, but I'm seeming to block out any general cons between the two. 

This is also not intended to spark any negativity towards either airline... I just need some general advice."

The American airlines I am considering are Southwest and JetBlue airways. I was also wondering is it mandatory to speak the language if I work for an international airline? like Emirates for example. I was also wondering when is the right time to apply for a flight attendant position? Do I have to wait until I turn 21 or can I apply a month or two before I turn 21?

16,Jumpseating Etiquette,3,3bbtjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/3bbtjd/jumpseating_etiquette/,4,2015-06-27 22:49:29,"Hey all! I'm interested to know if your airline has a specific protocol/etiquette for FA's who are jumpseating. By that I mean traveling using a reciprocal jumpseat agreement on another airline, but sitting in an available cabin seat. Are they required to check in with the CA? Do they fill out certain paperwork? Is there a difference if they're in uniform or not? What if the FA isn't in uniform and has taken their badge off? Should they still check in with the lead FA? Are the working crew members told who is traveling via jumpseat agreement? 

I ask just out of curiosity because I've encountered so many different attitudes on this while traveling! At my airline, the pilots don't ever want FA's to check in, and the traveling FA's don't have any forms to fill out or give to the CA. We're never given a manifest, so we never know who is a revenue passenger and who isn't. I've noticed at US Air that the FA does fill out a jumpseat form, but most often the CA doesn't need to keep a copy. I was told once on JetBlue that it was absolutely required every single time that I check in with the pilots. Ever since then when I fly on JetBlue, I talk to the lead FA and ask if I should check in with the pilots. Half the time they get confused and say no. 

So I'd love some insight on your airlines rules or etiquette on the matter! I've read our reciprocal jumpseat agreements, but they all seem to have the same verbiage despite a lot of airlines having different protocols. "
17,JetBlue or Frontier?,7,agudjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/agudjw/jetblue_or_frontier/,4,2019-01-17 08:09:16,"I received an offer from both JetBlue and Frontier airlines but I’m not sure which one to accept! 
JetBlue pays significantly higher and has better benefits and travel perks, however it would require me to relocate to Boston (which I would like to avoid!)  and be on reserve for several years. 
Frontier on the other hand has bad employee reviews on Glassdoor, but I wouldn’t have to relocate and I would get off reserve pretty quickly! Plus I had a much more positive experience interviewing with them. For example, Frontier flew me out to Denver for free, the recruiters were much friendlier, and they served coffee. 
JetBlue seemed like the obvious answer at first but after interviewing with both companies, I’m lost! Should I not base everything off first impressions? 
Does anyone have any advice or suggestions from either airline? Any comments would help! Thank you so much! "

As the result, I have been mostly been applying for big 3 American airlines (I currently living in the US) and JetBlue (that was my sister's recommendation as she has been flying with JetBlue), with the mindset of aim big or go home. However, I have only been getting TBNT so far.

I am 23 years old right now, finished with my Bachelor's degree in Psychology, and I was only started working since August 2016, as a part time retail sale associate. I had some unpaid internships and work-study experience, but they were not as ""formal"" and were mostly in campus settings. I have been talking to people who had worked as flight attendants before, and they said the best way for me to be more compatible as to have experience working the in Airline industry. One even said that I should be starting at regional first.

Am I really just being too ambitious for what I am worth as for now?"
