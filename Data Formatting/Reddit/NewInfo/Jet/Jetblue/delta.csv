0,Question about flying with an Autistic child,13,dgmczv,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dgmczv/question_about_flying_with_an_autistic_child/,21,2019-10-12 02:30:12,"So we're thinking of visiting Chicago in April and it would be my son's first flight. He'll be almost 6 at the time but he's Autistic. He loves car rides so as long as there's movement he's good. We'd also bring his tablet and lots of snacks. The flight is relatively short as well.

Here's my issue:
JetBlue is usually the preferred airline option for most families with Autism. In our situation I weighed the costs vs pros/cons. My husband and I are both big - he's over 6 feet but we're also heavier. If we did JetBlue we'd have to get very specific flights so the plane was 3x2 or 3x3 so we'd be together, and Economy seats are pretty tight. 

The other option is Delta.

Delta has a Canadair Regional Jet 900 that they use for NYC to Chicago flights. In First Class that's 1x2 seats. 

Taking cost into account I realized the difference between Economy JetBlue and First Class Delta was only $150 difference! Delta would mean significantly more room, less people to possibly disturb, and a flight attendant much closer if we needed anything. I'd also inform the airline ahead of time that he has Autism.

My question is this: has anyone taken a First Class flight with a child? I know I'm paying for a service but I don't want to get nasty looks from other passengers, as that's a real issue when we're out in public. He's pretty well behaved in that it's not like we let him run around screaming and hitting people, but he could potentially get scared during takeoff and landing and he could stim at times.

Is it generally frowned upon to seat a child in First Class? 

Has anyone flown with an Autistic child on Delta? If so, how was your experience, especially if you've also flown JetBlue."
1,Is Comfort+ worth it for a short domestic flight?,3,dlbeku,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dlbeku/is_comfort_worth_it_for_a_short_domestic_flight/,7,2019-10-22 06:38:28,"Normally when I travel domestically, I stick to JetBlue or Southwest. However, I managed to snag a great deal on a Delta flight even considering the $30 bag fee. Anyway, the trip is RIC->ATL then ATL->MIA, both of which are between 1:30 and 1:45 long. Is it worth paying $35-60 for each leg (or even one leg) given how short the flights are to upgrade from Main Economy to Comfort+? I see a lot of people talking about it as an upgrade or for a much longer and/or international flight, but not really in my situation."
2,Trying to switch,3,ctnmj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/ctnmj9/trying_to_switch/,6,2019-08-22 01:46:01,"So, I decided that I would look into switching loyalty from Jetblue (I'm Mosaic) to Delta. I'm NYC based and fly approximately 12x a year all over, usually one international trip. I have the Delta Amex reserve and have already hit the MQD waiver.  JetBlue has been frustrating with their labor issues (causing delays because of lack of personnel) and their limited footprint - especially International. So I started switching to Delta and have been pleased until today. I am booking travel for a meeting in Palm Springs in November (11/17 not Thanksgiving) and my wife will be accompanying me on this trip. The best fair in Comfort + -was $2200 (with a change in SLC). before booking, I looked at JetBlue and found direct for $689 and then upgraded to even more space (I used points because I'm mosaic  - but would have cost $360) for a street price of about $1050. I dont fly enough to split airlines and keep status on both, not sure if Delta is a good fit. ANyone have any tips I might be missing. Thanks"
