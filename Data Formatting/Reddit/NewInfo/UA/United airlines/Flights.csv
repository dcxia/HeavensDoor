Need to vent.",2,ca9axc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/ca9axc/flight_cancelled_with_aa_found_another_on_delta/,28,2019-07-07 21:22:16,"My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

&#x200B;

1,Looking for a new airline,0,afzpjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/afzpjx/looking_for_a_new_airline/,26,2019-01-14 23:02:45,"After flying most of my life with them, Southwest finally pissed me off with their constant delays and poor service (which it really is once you peel back the layers; they just sugarcoat how they're screwing you). I realize that Southwest was considered one of the ""good ones,"" but I'm now shopping for a new airline. I fly between Dallas and DC 25+ times a year for work.

Problem is, I already have reasons to hate American and United, pretty much the only other options I have (I have no reasons to hate Delta but they are never a low enough airfare for me to expense it).

I have Southwest A-List but it looks like status matching isn't an option for me, because American has that weird status challenge program that I don't think I'd be able to meet the requirements for (nor do I want to pay for the privilege of trying it), and I already have Premier Silver at United through my Marriott Platinum Elite status.

What's most important to me is customer service when it comes to dispute resolution (i.e. making it right after a bad experience), timeliness of departing/arriving flights, and lastly, benefits I'd get through the FF program.

Who should I pick and why?"

Booking honeymoon from Ohio to Italy for feb or March of 2020. Must be feb 16 or after. Any time in March. Two week trip. Literally any date in that time frame is fine. Also willing to do 13 day trip or 15 if that gets me a deal. 

A lot of search options but I can’t seem to find anything lower than 1200 each. 

Preferred departure from Dayton Ohio, will also depart from cincinnati or Columbus. 

Will fly into Venice, Florence, wherever I can get the best deal. 

So far I’ve looked mainly at flying into Venice or Rome and flying out of the opposite. 

Checked Skyscanner, google, kayak. 

Also checked delta, American Airlines, and United’s website specifically. 

I will pay 1200 each ticket if that’s what’s required, but I’m trying to find the best deal possible. 

Any sites I’m missing? I don’t know if I have too many search possibilities and that’s why it’s more complicated for me to search effectively. 

Any help appreciated!!

I had a first class flight from DFW to Chicago scheduled for 5:30pm or so today for a 4 day work trip. The flight kept getting delayed and pushed back, so they gave me the free option to switch to another flight. 

I picked the 7:30pm flight, which got delayed to 8...then 9....then 9:30...then 10....then cancelled - moved to tomorrow morning at 9:30AM. I just came back home and looks I'll be waking up to go to the airport tomorrow morning.

I have a 5-star hotel reservation for my stay (4 nights) in Chicago that has basically gone to waste for tonight, so not happy about that.

It seems DFW and ORD have both been a total CF today with the # of delays and cancellations.

What are my options for getting compensation from United? 

Not sure but I think earlier delays were due to weather in Chicago, then we literally got on the plane here and apparently air traffic control at both DFW and Lovefield basically had outages or something (wtf?), and they deplaned us, by which time, there's weather issues here.

So I don't even know anymore. I'm hoping since I paid a full fare first class ticket, there is some kind of compensation..."
5,United Airlines - Question about Same Day Flight Change,1,91c3bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/91c3bh/united_airlines_question_about_same_day_flight/,17,2018-07-24 03:21:49,"
I’ve recently purchased a ticket from FlightsBird to take me from SFO to Las Vegas, which departs on August 3rd at 6:45 pm. I recently learned that the appointment I have to attend to is at 11:00 AM instead of PM. It looks like according to the website, it will cost me $160 to change the flight to be any time earlier, plus an additional $50 because I purchased the ticket from a third party.  I.. really can’t afford this amount of money. 

Since I’m just a single person, it seems like there’s a high probability of me finding an available spot at an earlier time. I’ve never done a Same Day Flight Change before and I’m wondering if anyone here knows about it, specifically for United Airlines. If I show up at the earliest flight and there is room for me, will UA only charge me $75 (+$50 since I bought from a third party) to change my flight? Or will they no matter what charge me $160 + $50 = $210?

Sorry if this is an odd question. Thanks!"
6,Unable to choose seats on my ANA flight (flight cancellations involved),7,cxzyrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/cxzyrx/unable_to_choose_seats_on_my_ana_flight_flight/,17,2019-08-31 23:51:21,"Hi people!

I am afraid of the response I may receive here but would like to double check anyway in case of any new ideas you may come up with. My situation is the following:Originally booked the following route through ANA website and paid for it directly to them (including prepaid seat reservation of 50 USD so I could ensure 2 window seats in the twenty-something rows of the plan as I had originally wanted it):

\- Buenos Aires - NYC (United)- NYC - Tokyo - NYC (ANA)- NYC - Buenos Aires (United)

All was fine with seat reservation as I wanted, until United chose to discontinue their Buenos Aires - NYC route 2 weeks ago. Because of this problem (including not being able to visit NYC when we wanted, having our route changed), we went to United Airlines offices in our city (ANA local offices said they could not help us unfortunately) and they issued new flights, going through Houston instead of NYC, without additional costs (and these included Buenos Aires - Houston - Buenos Aires flights by United + Houston to Tokyo and back in ANA flights).

When we went back home with our new tickets, we were shocked to discover that even though the new flights were now present in my web reservation (in ANA.com) we had been put in the last seats of the plane (seats in rows 41/42 basically) for each leg between Houston and Tokyo, next to the bathroom + food carts, which was not at all what I expected, and less so after having paid for a prepaid seat reservation fee with my initial purchase. After this, I contacted ANA local offices again, they said they could not help so I called ANA in the USA (with the high costs involved) 3 different times + United local offices several times, without success in obtaining better seats. While ANA USA tells me that because United booked these new flights (which are indeed ANA own flights...) they have no power at all to change my seat reservation, When I speak with United, they tell me that it is an ANA flight and that they cannot do anything about it....

So, basically, even though having bought the flights initially through ANA website, paid for prepaid reservation fees to get the seats I wanted (plus booking almost 8 months in advance to ensure I got those seats), I am now left with the worst seats of the plan without any possible solution I can think of.

Do you know what else I could do? Any recommendations as to how to proceed?

Thank you!"

in September I am travelling from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then from Frankfurt to USA.

I bought tickets through Momondo, not directly from the airline company.

Flight from Zagreb to Frankfurt is Lufthansa (operated by Air Nostrum (?)), while flight from Frankfurt to USA is operated by United Airlines.

There is 1h 30min layover in Frankfurt which is plenty to get to my 2nd flight, but here's the catch.

I've been checking flight history of a flight from Zagreb to Frankfurt and most of the time it's delayed for 1 hour, sometimes more, sometimes less, meaning, I might not make it to my 2nd flight. 

What happens if I don't? As it's not my fault that I did not make it, do I get some kind of compensation, like priority boarding on a next plane or something else? What should I do in that case?

This time around I really was looking to buy the cheapest tickets. Today I decided to buy one and the only option to buy it was through United website where I went and tried to purchase, however, no matter what I did it just gave me an error and I decided to call United where I was told they do not service Google Flights...

So, I then went on looking for more tickets and I had found something through Hipmunk, for even cheaper than what I found on Google Flights. Then it took me to a website called ExploreTrip that is where I checked the flights once again and then inputted all my info and (bought?) the ticket, I then received an Itinerary from them stating all the flights I picked and I thought that it was way too easy and then I started questioning where do I see the confirmation of the flights, choose seats and so on. I tried to go back to the website, but on their main page all you could do is search for more flights and some contact information.

So, I started googling the website and got upon multiple bad reviews and red flags saying that the service is bad, where people had bought the ticket and then were told that it was canceled, credit cards charged multiple times, the list goes on... At that moment my soul just dropped deep down low to my heel. I started panicking a little and called that company right away where I was greeted by a customer rep with a fairly difficult to understand accent. I told him my order # and so on, and asked him to confirm that I indeed got the tickets and how where I go about picking the seats. The rep sent me a confirmation email saying that the tickets did go through, this time the Itinerary had more information with PER-FLIGHT order number. My entire trip was to go through United Airlines, Swiss and Lufthansa. So I picked my first flight which was through United AL, and checked the flights status on their official website, and to my surprise everything seemed fine, it right away popped all of my flights at once which was a slight relief.

Am I tripping out too much? Am I actually fine? What could I do to further confirm that yes, that indeed everything went through just fine and so on, since the price was a little too hard to believe. I was also able to choose the seats for some flights too. How could I make sure that I was not scammed? How can I be sure that I won't get told that my ticket doesn't work upon registering for the flight at the time and day of the flight?"
15,Advice on which rewards plan/airline to utilize,3,9crzp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/9crzp1/advice_on_which_rewards_planairline_to_utilize/,14,2018-09-04 07:23:40,"Hello,

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

Last night I've gotten an email saying this:

> Please call us. 
> We are trying to reach you with an important message regarding your upcoming United flight(s).
> Please call us at 800-451-2461 regarding confirmation number [...]

The confirmation number is the right one; the phone # at least [seems to be legit](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/united-airlines-mileageplus/1647821-check-your-ua-itineraries-schedule-changes-what-do-after-one-archive-73.html). I've called them today, and after some 10 mins of waiting loop, learnt that the forward leg (Jul 4) of my flight has been cancelled (the flight itself, or just my booking of it?) and that my only option is to book another flight (or the same one?) at a higher price. The whole idea struck me as strange and I dropped the call, suspecting a scam -- but checking the United website, I realized that the forward leg had indeed disappeared.

What are my options, and what is the best one? Can I just cancel the back leg as well and work with another carrier? (I could even try booking the same flight through Lufthansa, if it doesn't fall afoul of Fly America.) Is it normal for them to just cancel my booking? I don't have a ticket, just a ""printer-friendly purchase confirmation""; one thing that *might* have happened is that my script blocker has somehow messed up the booking process.

Also, is there a way to handle these things other than by phone?"
20,Advice on United nonrev (standby) travel from Colorado to Japan last week of March?,4,7c3d50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/7c3d50/advice_on_united_nonrev_standby_travel_from/,12,2017-11-10 22:28:58,"Hey there, /r/Flights!


I am planning a two week trip to Japan, flying from DEN to NRT on March 24th and coming back on April 9th. In order to make the best use of my time, I chose the non-stop United 143 & United 142 respective outbound and return flights (about $1900).


However, I have an awesome family member that works for United and offered to add me to his buddy list for this flight, which would make the flight about 80% cheaper. This would be a huge savings, but at a risk. For those who don't know, flying on a buddy pass is referred to as a non-revenue ticket or ""nonrev"", meaning the airline doesn't make a profit on it. On a nonrev you fly standby, so there isn't a guarantee that you will have a seat the moment the plane boards. But if there are available seats, any standby passengers get any remaining available seats.


So my question to you all is whether or not I should take the risk of flying standby for the crazy discount. I'm trying to factor in the following:

I'm not flying over a holiday or major festival, even though it seems to be the peak of cherry blossom season and coincides with spring break.

I don't have a hotel reservation I have to stick to (staying with someone I know).

The price of a guaranteed ticket will obviously go up the longer I wait to purchase it, if that's the route I take. For the next few weeks the price shouldn't change, though.

The nonrev ticket price shouldn't change at all, even up until day-of and I don't pay for the ticket if I don't get on the plane.

When I got the offer a week or so ago, I checked on a comparable flight 3 days out on a Saturday and it still had 20+ seats available. If I am really traveling during a not busy time, the same should hold true - [this blog post appears to support the idea](http://www.clearedlist.net/fly-standby-april/).


I'm hoping you fine folks here in /r/Flights will have some good advice for me!"

This is my first flight of this nature and I don't have a preference for any of these airlines based on past experience. I've mostly flown Southwest and American within the US. And American is more expensive for this particular flight so I crossed it off the list. Planning to book directly with airline, not a third party site (prices are basically the same).

I'll be booking on a Capital One Venture card and will earn 50,000 miles with their program for this flight so not interested in comparing airline-specific card deals to sway my decision."

American Main Cabin Extra (MCE), Delta Comfort Plus (Comfort+), United Economy Plus (Economy+) are economy cabin seats with some enhancements, they are not comparable to true premium economy service from airlines such as BA or Lufthansa.

In the last year we have seen several corporations convert from Premium Economy services on European airlines to Economy Plus on American airlines based on ""better pricing"". This is a downgrade. These services are not equal, American MCE can't compare to BA World Traveller Plus, United EconomyPlus can't compare to Lufthansa Premium Economy.

Unfortunately, this is catching out many unfamiliar corporate travellers who are not aware these Economy Plus seats are vastly inferior with much reduced leg room and seat width as well as regular Economy food and drink.

If you do have any say in choosing between these services or influencing your corporate travel agreements, please compare products directly rather than assuming equivalence from names.

Although I always remind any personal travelers I am looking after, not all agents are doing this as our commission is fee and not based on price, so personal travelers used to European standards are also being disappointed after flying the American choices."
26,Baby due next month. What are my options for flying my family out given the uncertainty of when the child will arrive?,8,74rq2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/74rq2s/baby_due_next_month_what_are_my_options_for/,10,2017-10-07 04:25:24,"My girlfriend is pregnant and due on November 5. We live in Los Angeles.

My family is excited to meet their grandson/nephew. They live in New York.

I'm trying to figure out the best option for them to travel out here since we can't say for sure when the baby will arrive. They can't stay indefinitely as everyone needs to minimize time off work. Here are some options I've already explored through American and United:

1. Buy a fully refundable ticket. This is absurdly expensive; it's cheaper to just buy a last-minute ticket.

2. Buy a last-minute ticket. Obviously better than option 1, but this still runs about $700 per round trip ticket. Yikes.

3. Buy tickets now and hope the baby comes on time. But changing flights incurs a $200 fee plus the difference in airfare, which is more than option 2.

4. Use rewards miles to buy them tickets now. If they have to change flights, I'd only need to make up the difference in mileage required. So if I get my mom a ticket for Nov 5 for 15K miles and my gf goes into labor on Nov 1 and a last minute ticket is 20K miles, I'd just have to fork over the additional 5K miles. But I can't make up the difference in cash, so if I don't have enough miles (like if the last minute ticket is 75K miles), then I can't do anything about it. And if she doesn't end up using the Nov 5 flight at all, I have to pay a fee of $150 to reclaim those miles or I forfeit them.

5. Use trip insurance. Buy separate flights for Nov 1, Nov 6, and Nov 11. If the baby doesn't arrive by Nov 1, cancel that flight and eat the insurance (like $50). And then repeat for the second flight, and definitely fly the third (baby can't come much later than that). The only problem is the fine print on those insurance policies; I think you can only cancel your trip if you have qualified excuses like a medical problem, etc. How stingy are airlines about using the insurance? Can you just say, ""Hey, I'm not taking this flight"", and they just say, ""You have insurance, so no worries."" This plan also requires laying out money for three flights, but that's what credit cards are for, I guess.

Does anyone have any better ideas? It doesn't seem right that families should have to choose between paying triple the normal cost of a flight or meeting their grandchild. They used to offer bereavement fares, but apparently those are gone now. I was hoping there was something similar for births. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Some advice from experienced fliers would be greatly appreciated!

The situation: I work in London, but have been invited to interview for a couple of PhD positions in California. The interviews are a couple of weeks apart, so I can’t batch them into one trip (and I’m not allowed to take more than four consecutive days off from work anyway). As a result, I’ll be making two rapid-fire trips from London to California and back (2.5 days on the ground for the first, 1.5 days for the second). I’ve never flown so far before, so I’m quite nervous.

Complications: I need to be performing as highly as possible for the interviews of course, and fully functioning at work the morning after I get back from each trip. (Otherwise it counts as taking additional unapproved holiday time.) These two trips take up all of my accrued holiday, and my company can’t know about these interviews, so I’m not able to extend either trip. The universities will only pay for the basic economy fare, and I’m just not able to cover the increase in fare for premium economy myself (+£1100/$1500 for the first trip alone), so I’m stuck in coach. I’m worried about seat width as I am fairly tall (5’11”). I only have 8kg of luggage allowance. Oh, and I’ve never been able to sleep on planes, not even with heavy-grade sleeping medication. 

(I’m not entirely sure who my first flight is with. I booked it through Austrian, after booking they said it was actually operated by United, and it has a Lufthansa flight number. I plan to call Austrian this weekend to see if I can confirm the underlying airline and get their booking code, and then see if I can upgrade to an exit seat or something.)

So my question is... is this manageable? Or am I a wee bit screwed? 

Specifically:

1. How do I manage such long and densely distributed flights?
2. Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of being alert at the interviews and at work after?
3. Any advice on keeping my luggage under the 8kg? I plan to wear my interview shoes on the plane. 
4. Has anyone else balanced international interviews with a high-pressure job? How did it go?

Thank you!!

Tl;dr: I have two weekend interview trips from London to California coming up this month, and I haven’t flown that far before. What do I do?"

It's a bit tricky question and all the airlines are giving me generic answers so thought I'd seek some insights here.

My original flight is with Aerlingus from Barcelona to Dublin and to Chicago. My final destination in the US has changed to Austin so I'm now looking at domestic flight from ORD to AUS for next Friday... What I want to do is purchasing a United Arline ticket leaving that night from Chicago to Austin which will only leave me 1 hour and 30 minutes to transfer in Chicago. 

My flight from Dublin to Chicago is co-operated by United with Aerlingus. In the past I have purchased two different United flights AUS - IAD and IAD to DUB under different booking numbers because somehow separating them was cheaper. When I checked in in Austin, the lady found my another booking made under my name and made my final destination to Dublin so I don't have to get my baggage and recheck it in Washington. 

I was hoping somehow I can do this and ask to make my final destination Austin instead of Chicago when I check in in Barcelona but I wonder if it would be doable because it's a different airlines in Barcelona. My US customs will be cleared in Dublin so I don't do that when I land in Chicago but if I have to recheck in would an hour 30 be too short given the fact I'll have to move from Terminal 5 to Terminal 1 to recheck in though it's a domestic flight...

39,My Flight Itinerary Changed and now I have a 30 minute Layover instead of an hour layover at San Francisco International.,2,6lbbtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/6lbbtl/my_flight_itinerary_changed_and_now_i_have_a_30/,8,2017-07-05 06:32:16,"My girlfriend and I will be flying to Hawaii this November for a much needed vacation. We already have our flights booked and just a few days ago, I received an email saying that our flight itinerary has changed. We went from having an hour layover in San Francisco to a 36 minute layover. I am very stressed about this because we have a hotel to check into when we arrive in Hawaii around 4PM. So my question is, is anyone familiar with San Francisco International? Is it easy to move around in? Are the gates pretty close? We are flying United Airlines all the way there.

40,Transfer on LAX questions and schedule rearranging from UA doubts,1,ajiax5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/ajiax5/transfer_on_lax_questions_and_schedule/,8,2019-01-25 01:48:04,"Hey guys

&#x200B;

So, Ill make a travel to Japan on April from SJO (Costa Rica) to Japan. I have two transfers in the US, specifically, on Houston and later on LAX. This last one is the one I am most concern. 

Im expected to arrive to LAX from Houston  at 23:36 on April 11 and transfer to leave at 00:50  to Japan, therefore, a window  of 1 hour 14 minutes.

Would you consider this is enough time, considering I did migration on Houston already?  Into consideration would be that a person travelling with me doesn't need wheelchairs but it does have to walk at a relative normal to slow pace (basically no rushing). This is what LAX says about the  walking time on their page: [https://www.flylax.com/en/inter-terminal-connections](https://www.flylax.com/en/inter-terminal-connections). Thanks for any input here, basically I'm kinda scared since from past experiences I normally have delays and plus the walking length from United Airlines terminals (terminals 7 - 8) to International, it seems I dont have much of a window, and I would really hate to lose the flight to Japan and miss a day.

&#x200B;

The second, kinda related topic, is that before I had a 1 hour 51 minutes layover but they made a reschedule. Due to this I tried to call and change my flight but they say that the connection is guaranteed and they wont change me to another flight (the option is one that goes out in the early morning from SJO and have considerable more time of layovers in Houston and in LAX). They address that they have the right to change schedules (which i understand and have no issue) but I found that in their page they also say that if they reschedule for more than 30 minutes an arrival or departure time  a change can be made.  [https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/help/faq/schedule-changes.html](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/help/faq/schedule-changes.html)

After prompting this to my local Call center they just insist the first rule the apply is the contract of carriage [https://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/contract.aspx](https://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/contract.aspx)

&#x200B;

Does anyone have had similar experience and is there a possibility to keep asking on higher managers to help reschedule or is a lost cause?

I will try to keep this as brief as possible. In February I booked round trip plane tickets from SJO, Costa Rica to Manado (MDC), Indonesia for a scuba trip in October. I was able to book this entire trip through the United Airlines website. Recently, I decided to use my confirmation number to check on the flights and noticed that my flights from Tokyo to Manado through Jakarta were missing. I double-checked my original email confirmation of the purchase, and everything was there.

After talking to them on the phone, it appears they are unable to confirm my seats for these tickets. Their explanation was that these tickets were through a different airline, and they could not force them to accept my reservation. They never notified me of any issues with my reservation. I coincidentally noticed the problem. Obviously I was a little frustrated, I had imagined booking everything through the United website guaranteed me these seats.

Now they have offered to change my flight to roundtrip to Singapore (free of charge as a courtesy - thanks United) and recommended I book round trip travel for the remaining itinerary on my own through another airline. They are unwilling to offer any additional discount or compensation for the $1200 tickets I will be responsible for.

I can't help but feel like United dropped the ball and are trying to fix their mistake in the cheapest way possible to them. I have heard that there are certain rights for airline travelers but am not sure how they would apply to this specific situation."

Currently I'm looking at a round trip flight that goes BNA -> LAX -> NRT, with a 3 hour layover in LAX. Normally, this wouldn't be any concern, but the trip is listed through Kayak's hacker fares, so its actually two tickets (one round trip BNA/LAX through Delta, another LAX/NRT through United). 

I've done some research, but I'm still not entirely sure how this will affect my trip and would appreciate if someone could help clarify a few main points. Primarily:

1. How will this affect my baggage? (ie. will I need to go to baggage claim in LAX and recheck everything in since it will be with different airlines, or can I still have it follow me straight from BNA?)
2. If my BNA -> LAX flight is delayed/canceled (or NRT -> LAX on the return) and I am not able to reach the next flight in time, will the airline(s) still work with me to get me on another flight?
3. Depending on the answers to the previous questions, will a 3 hour layover in LAX be too tight/risky? I don't fly often and I'm not familiar with LAX so I'm hoping someone with some more experience could give some advice.

This was for a family trip. 

While in Beijing, my dad got very sick. We took him to the hospital, he got medication, and started on his path to recovery. He went to the hospital the day of our flight, and given that he was very weak and sick, we decided it would be best for him to stay behind in Beijing and not travel on with us. I figured it would be a fairly easy refund with it being medical and all. 

So I reached out to Vayama to ask how to go about getting a refund. Turns out it's more complicated than I imagined- they want all kinds of official documentation, such as a letter from the attending Doctor, on the hospital's official letterhead, explaining that there is no possible way this person could travel with this medical condition, etc. 

And that's *totally* doable that we are going to get that information from a doctor we saw one time in a city we were temporarily in. *rolls eyes*. Plus, given the timing of it, we simply didn't have any time to even collect all this information. Our return flight went Chengdu to Beijing, brief layover in the airport to meetup with my dad, then return flight to the US. 

What's my next possible route for refunding the ticket? I thought that I would be covered with a travel protection plan because I bought it under my MilagePlus card but now I can't seem to find any info regarding travel protection on non-United flights. 

I don't even care if we don't get a full refund, but at least some of the money would be nice to have back. 

Should I just send Vayama the medical documents we have (in Chinese) and see if they will accept it? The thing is, his condition wasn't life threatening, but it was miserable enough that he felt more comfortable staying behind, and I feel like airlines probably don't give a crap about how you feel, but how the doc diagnoses you. 

Anyway, what should I do next? I appreciate your input, especially if anyone can enlighten me on if I have some sort of trip protection through my card. "

I've only flown a scant few times in my life and next weekend I'm going to be flying out on business and during that journey I'll be encountering two firsts - my first layover and my first experience on regional jets.  Both legs of my departing trip will be on United regional carriers.

I'll be departing from Westchester/White Plains via Wisconsin Air and going to O'Hare.  After a 55 minute layover I'll be taking SkyWest to Boise.  What I gather from other posts is that the ""sweet spot"" for domestic layovers is typically an hour, so my 55 minute layover is at least close.

What I'm wondering is about bags.  I know that my bag will not fit in overhead (it is regulation size but not for smaller planes), and even if it did fit, I've never flown United before and do not have priority boarding so I suspect whatever limited overhead capacity there is will be filled up well before I board.

My understanding is that when doing a layover on jetliners they will forward your bags to your final destination, but it sounds like regional planes have you retrieve your bags on the jetway and then take them to your next plane.  If so should I anticipate a potential delay here as if I had to go to baggage?

I guess I'm just trying to plan for any potential problems - a delay in getting to the gate + a bag delay + navigating a very large airport for the first time could mean that 55 minute layover disappears in a hurry.  Unfortunately it seems there are very few direct flights to Boise so I need to make this work or else I think they'll send me on a second connection somewhere.

Any feedback or experience with making connections on regional airlines would be appreciated."

I'm asking because the e-mail I got says it's United Flight 8266 (Operated by Air Canada), United Flight 803 (doesn't say anything, assuming it's by United), then United Flight 7971 (Operated by All Nippon Airways).  

My confusion is the whole, Air Canada, United, Nippon.  I've only ever done multiple legs with the same airline. I highly doubt AC will put my bags on a United flight for me ....

Thank you! If you need more information, please let me know.  "

(Note: My grandma has the same type of bag to stow under the seat, and she is also taking her purse separate, so if this is something to genuinely be concerned about she needs to figure out what she is going to do too.)

I've had no issue with taking more than one ""personal item"" on other airlines with the exact same one-item-per-passenger policy (I actually got away with three different bags on a United flight once), and I understand it varies between airports/employees working at the gate.

I should also add that I have flown Spirit in the past and enjoyed the service, although that time my parents were also driving to our destination with a rental car (and everybody's luggage, so we basically got on the plane with nothing but our phones and wallets/purse) so this wasn't a potential concern then."

One flight that I like (because it doesn't involve connecting in the USA), is Calgary to Vancouver, Vancouver - Brisbane (all aboard the dreamliner!!), Brisbane - Christchurch.

Only issue is that on the way out the flight only has a 55 minute layover in Brisbane. Now, I've done tight connections before in Denver connecting to Vegas with United Airlines, but that was one airline connecting in one terminal. Here's where I'm getting confused, I'm used to flights where if theres a connection or two it's either all one airline, or it's a 'codeshare' flight within Star Alliance. However, in this case, the first two legs of the flight are Air Canada but Brisbane to Christchurch is a Qantas flight which isn't a codeshare and as far as I can find out Qantas isn't part of teh Star Alliance, even though Air Canada is selling it to me as part of one ticket on their website.

So I guess the question is:

If the YVR-BNE leg is delayed somehow causing me to miss the BNE-CHC flight, is Air Canada responsible to get me Christchurch because they sold me the ticket with a 55 minute connection, or am I on my own? "

I'm planning to book a flight for Saturday, November 26 - Monday, December 5, 2016, leaving from IAD (Dulles) and heading to KIX (Osaka, Japan). I already know the flight I want to take:

1.5 hour layover at SFO

Departing Mon, Dec 5  
6:20 pm Osaka, JP (KIX - Kansai)  
2hr layover at SFO  
Arriving 9:15 pm Washington, DC, US (IAD - Dulles)  
Washington, DC, US (IAD - Dulles)  
  
I've been monitoring the flight over the past few months and the price has been slowing creeping down from the $1400s to the $1300s. I was hoping for it to fall in the $1200s before I bought my ticket. The 3-months-out mark was last Friday and I was holding out to see if there would be a price dip. To my horror, when I checked the flight on Friday it had jumped roughly $700 in price, up to $2049 for the trip! I'm pretty much panicking right now. Based on experience, do you think I need to give up on this flight?   

P.S. I know there are other much cheaper flights available that involve a layover in China, but I've done that in the past and have no desire to do it again.

I've never flown before and don't really know what I'm doing so I apologize in advance if anything I say sounds dumb.

I bought an international ticket (Montreal - Chicago, Chicago - Shanghai, Shanghai - Osaka) through google flights, with United Airlines (last leg is Jungyao Airlines) at the beginning of April. I got my ticket and confirmation number and everything was swell. I got curious today to see how much the same ticket would be if I were to have bought it now, two weeks before departure, and it isn't listed on google flights anymore. I panicked thinking maybe the flight was cancelled so I went on the United website's ""My Trips"" section, entered my confirmation number and family name, and the flight is still there, it's listed, waiting for me, nothing says it's changed or cancelled or anything.

Can somebody tell me why this can happen? Was the flight sold out? In that case will it most likely be overbooked? Do they stop listing flights in order to promote other flights? How does that work... Just trying to understand. Thanks guys!"

Well I got an e-mail from an airline that only goes out of a city 30 minutes away with a $126 round trip deal to Los Angeles and packages from various airlines out of LAX to be around $800-$900 per person. So my main questions are: What is a reasonable amount of time should I aim for between landing in LAX and the flight to HNL? Also, how do I make sure to get our luggage tagged to get on the next flight to HNL? Like, if I used Hawaiian airlines for the LAX-HNL part (which isn't an airline in the city near me) will my luggage get tagged for that flight or will I have to leave the terminal in LAX, get my luggage, and then recheck it?

I already have a frequent flyer membership with United but I book only ANA codeshare with them as opposed to actually flying United.

I don't ever plan on flying on United after that fiasco (this might sound extremely petty), so the frequent flier points I get would only be from the rate of the lowest tier.

I plan on flying ANA for about 5 of those trips.  I could just book directly with ANA but I just got my Chase Sapphire card and it turns out I can transfer my Chase Sapphire reward points to United. Chase is not partnered with ANA unfortunately so I can't transfer it to ANA.

I also almost have gold with EVA Airlines but again Chase isn't partnered with EVA so I can't transfer directly to from Chase. I only have about 25k points in both EVA and United after using them for some purchases leftover, so it's not too much loss.

Should I use my Chase Sapphire to book directly via ANA and actually be able to get tiers or via United even thought I will never able able to get to the next tier in their frequent flier program,  allowing me to use the Chase points to pay for the United Flights?

I asked if I can see the credit through UR or my United account, but the UR rep told me the only way to book the flight is to find a flight schedule I like and call them up.

I have described the context of the situation below, please could you let me know if you think I’m eligible for compensation or not?

This flight was booked through British Airways but operated by American Airlines. The issues started when our initial aircraft was discovered to have a hydraulic leak in Miami and consequently was put out of service whilst a replacement aircraft came in from London Heathrow. This delay was approximately 1 hour 30 minutes.

Once we were on the aircraft we were taxiing to the take off when the plane abruptly stopped and an announcement was made asking if there was a certain individual on the plane. Once it became clear this individual was not on the plane the plane returned to the gate. It became apparent that a passenger on the plane had accidentally picked up a piece of baggage that did not belong to them and the person who it did belong to was not onboard the flight, therefore for security reasons the piece of luggage had to be removed from the plane.

Once the security staff had interviewed the passenger and carried out a search of the aircraft we departed from Miami. We landed at London Heathrow approximately 2 hours 30 minutes later than expected. However as we began taxiing to the gate our path became blocked by departing aircraft. The key fact is here that by the time we got to the gate and the First door opened on the plane the time was just past 12:01, meaning that the plane was now over 3 hours later (3 hours 1 minute). Under EU regulation, the time of arrival is the point at which the aircraft door opens and the first passenger was able to disembark.

I received this reply from AA today:

As you have correctly identified, European Union Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 of the European Parliament and Council has established common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of cancellations or long delays of flights. Under this regulation, in the event of a flight cancellation or delay, passengers are entitled to established levels of compensation. However, this regulation does not apply when a flight is cancelled or delayed for less than 3-hours, flight is departing from the United States or a flight is cancelled or delayed due to weather or Air Traffic Control issues. Since flight 1529 was delayed because of non-qualifying reason situation, American Airlines is not required to provide the compensation you have referred to.



Based on the above, do I have any grounds or is it dead in the water? I can’t see how it isn’t a qualifying reason?

Additionally, could I have any recourse with BA?

Many thanks in advance"

From the pictures I've seen NA premium looks like the mid-2000's United, Lufthansa, or Aer Lingus business class cabin before they introduced the newer lay flat seats.

Overall a couple of questions-how comfortable are the seats in premium class? Do they have enough leg room? As I'm a fairly tall guy.

96,United Airlines Baggage Sizer,1,49xw2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/49xw2t/united_airlines_baggage_sizer/,3,2016-03-11 11:23:14,"Hey /r/Flights!

I'm flying United on Saturday night, and I was wondering how their baggage policy works -- specifically having to do with the personal item and carryon. I have a soft [backpack](http://cdn1.ebags.com/is/image/im8/277918_1_1?resmode=4&op_usm=1,1,1,&qlt=80,1&hei=1500&wid=1500&align=0,1&res=1500), and a larger [Swissgear bag](https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/dkPTz5ULdNHNjbYeQ7Fa/Vv-960x582/v1/c700x420.jpg) (that is actually a bit smaller in height than the one linked).

I'm worried that one of both of these bags won't fit into the sizer. (each is about an inch or so too large in one dimension). They're both soft bags, so packing them properly would allow them to squeeze into the required dimensions. Does anyone have experience with this?"
97,United Airlines connection (too short)?,1,azbct8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/azbct8/united_airlines_connection_too_short/,3,2019-03-10 06:54:18,"Hi folks,

I am not much of an air traveler; taking an international flight after a while.

My itinerary: UA 1972 (from DC to EWR) --> UA 48 (from EWR to Mumbai). The connection time is 1 hr 3 mins on paper. I originally booked it because I wanted the connection to be short, but due to a screwup (I thought the connection time was 1 hr 50 mins for some reason when booking the flight), it is \*too short\*.

I am traveling with 2 kids. Changing/canceling the ticket is going to be very expensive and is probably going to cost me the entire price of 4 tickets (me, spouse and 2 kids).

Scenario:

\+ After multiple back and forth calls with United, I am able to ascertain that we would not have to do another security checkin at EWR and our connecting flight departs from the exact same terminal we arrive at (terminal C).

\+ United does have a later flight at 10.20 PM that goes to Mumbai via Paris. This route also looks less crowded (as the more popular option is the direct flight that I have booked right now), so I am thinking we can get booked on that flight.

\- We are traveling with 2 kids, and while we are ok with missing the connecting flight and taking the next available one, the thought that terrifies me is having to spend the night at the terminal. Our connecting flight departs at 8.10 PM and the last flight according to my research leaves EWR at 11 PM. If we don't get booked on any flight that day, will United host us in a hotel room on the airport premises? I don't want my kids to sleep on the floor as much as I can avoid it. Any advice/anecdotes here would be hugely helpful, since I could not get a straight answer from anyone on the phone.

What would you guys do if you were in my situation? Am I overthinking this, and should take my chances, or is this my-house-is-on-fire situation and requires drastic measures even if it results in me losing upwards of $3k?

Thank you!

\*\*\*\* UPDATE \*\*\*\*\*

Thank you everyone who replied to the thread. Sincerely appreciated!

\- [gt\_ap](https://www.reddit.com/user/gt_ap), all great points! To be clear, I was fine with the possibility of missing my connection \*with the expectation\* that my \*worst case scenario\* was being able to spend the night in a nearby hotel. What confused me was this - would I even be allowed to exit the terminal since I was already in transit? I posted this same question on tripadvisor, and I was assured by the experienced travelers that I certainly would be able to leave the terminal since I was still in the US. This did alleviate my concerns. I was prepared to shell out my own money to stay in a hotel of my own choice if it came down to that.

\- [tariqabjotu](https://www.reddit.com/user/tariqabjotu): I was wrong about the information on connecting flight (in my haste, I looked for alternative flights originating from IAD, whereas I should have done my search for flights originating from EWR). The alternate flight \*originating from EWR and reaching Mumbai\* is actually scheduled at 8.45 PM and connects via Munich. However as [FriendlyCrustaceans](https://www.reddit.com/user/FriendlyCrustaceans) said, taking a flight that connects me a second time through someplace else is only exacerbating the risk. In the vein, it would be better to simply take the direct flight from EWR to Mumbai and I might have to wait a full 24 hours to do that! Obviously, I was not prepared to lose a full day of my vacation.

\- I made this post after I already talked to United reps \*on the phone\* asking them to reschedule my IAD to EWR leg. However, the \*draconian option\* they gave me would cost me: $300 (penalty) + $50 (third party booking fee - Orbitz) + \~$650 (fare difference!!!). essentially, they were trying to rebook my entire itinerary essentially costing me the price of a new ticket altogether and also messing up my currently friendly return flight timings. This made the transaction an impossibility.

\- In my final attempt, I decided to reach United via their Facebook page. I messaged them, and within approximately \~2 hrs, I was engaged. The rep on the Facebook page was clearly more knowledgable and it took me only 2 roundtrip messages to explain them the situation which they understood perfectly. The response time after engagement was \~10 mins (not bad!). Immediately, the rep offered me to change my IAD to EWR leg at \*absolutely no cost\* due to something they called \*flight misalignment\*. I believe the rep was kind and used an internal technicality to make this change, and I took it! There is an alternate United flight from IAD to EWR leaving 12.30 PM. The issue now is I will wait \~6 hrs at EWR but at least, there will be peace of mind. I also have flex work arrangement, so I can even get some work done at the airport.

&#x200B;

All is well that ends well. Thanks everyone again, and I hope this post helps someone who finds themselves in the same situation."

I recently bought a RT ticket through United from Philly to Salt Lake City. About a week later me and my friend decided we would stay longer, drive south and check out the Grand Canyon and eventually fly out of Phoenix.
We leave March 31st and return on April 7th.

Yesterday I called United to see about changing my departure location and was informed there is a $200 cancelation fee + the cost of the new flight from Phoenix to Philly. 

So I booked the new one way flight from Phoenix, and skipped the fee.

Currently the 2 flights that I had originally booked on my return trip are selling for $157 and $357. Would it not be beneficial for the airline to know that I won't be on the plane so that they can rebook these seats? 
Is there any way I can talk them into giving a credit/miles? 

I always look at that ""buy insurance"" and say ahhhh I don't need that. Lesson learned.

TIA for any input. 

EDIT: Forgot to include that the second $357 flight is sold out. It would surely be booked?"

On United Airlines website they have details on sports equipment in the following link, https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/baggage/sports.aspx It states the following for Ski and Snowboard Equipment: . . United accepts one item of ski or snowboard equipment per customer as checked baggage. Equipment must be securely encased in a suitable container. An item of ski equipment consists of: Water skis Up to two snowboards in one bag Up to two pairs of snow skis and associated equipment in one bag and one ski boot bag. If the combined weight of the ski bag and boot bag is over 50 pounds (23 kg), applicable overweight charges apply. A boot bag without an accompanied ski bag is considered one bag and normal baggage fees apply. First or second checked bag service charges may apply. Ski equipment in addition to the baggage allowance will be assessed at the current excess baggage charge for a single piece, whether or not it is presented as a single piece. Ski and boot bags weighing more than 50 pounds (23 kg) that contain other items in addition to or in place of appropriate ski equipment will be subject to the applicable overweight checked baggage service charge. United is not liable for damage to water ski, snow ski, or snowboard equipment. Excess Valuation may not be purchased for water ski, snow ski, or snowboard equipment. . . . I've tried calling United and get a different answer each time in regards to being charged an oversize baggage fee. Since majority of adult snowboard bags are larger than 62 inches (158 cm). The description states if the bag is more than 50 lbs than it will receive a overweight baggage fee, however it states nothing about oversize baggage fee. I'm not sure if sport equipment overrules that because it does not state it. . I'm wondering if others just pay the standard $25 checked bag fee or if they are charged $200 for oversize baggage. .
