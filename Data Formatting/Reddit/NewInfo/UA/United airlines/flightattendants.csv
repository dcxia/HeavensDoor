I‚Äôve been applying to every airline under the sun over the last few months, but I‚Äôm just not having any luck üòï
Recently, I‚Äôve had F2F interviews with SkyWest, Frontier, and United. I‚Äôve also completed a handful of video interviews for other airlines. I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm going wrong, but I‚Äôm starting to become slightly discouraged..

How long did it take you to land your position? Did you also have to go through multiple interviews before receiving a CJO? I know this is a very competitive industry, so I‚Äôm trying to keep my head and spirits up! Any advice would be much appreciated ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thank you!"

What airlines do you recommend? Or what airlines do you recommend as a good airline to get my feet wet, or at least in the air? Not some super strict I'll lose my job airline. These are the airlines I've applied to:
United- had a f2f 6 months ago, so my time is coming back around
Frontier-rejected
Republic-VI (didn't do)
Virgin America- VI rejected
Delta- VI Archived.. Whatever that means
American Airlines- rejected
Skywest- couldn't make the hiring fair
Horizon- f2f rejected
Alaska- f2f rejected (but told me they'd recommend me to Horizon.. not sure if they meant recommend to apply or recommend me to the hiring team)

Edit: I currently work at a bank and have a wrist tattoo so I understand professionalism but not sure if that plays a factor in deciding airlines.
 
Also I've heard Omni and Envoy are good airlines"

My only concern is that we had preplanned a European vacation between 3/25-4/5, with everything already paid for. 

Can she contact HR and inform them of the situation and ask to report a little later 4/6?, or will she have to apply in the next round or with a different airline, as we really aren‚Äôt planning on throwing away this upcoming trip (already rescheduled once from thanksgiving).

Darn, but as it was my first attempt, I'm not totally heartbroken.  However my heart is really set on working with American Airlines as a flight attendant, and I totally plan on applying again when the next opportunity arises, but I need to look at my other options as well. What can I do in the meantime? 

&#x200B;

I'm definitely applying for other airlines and keeping an eye out for when Delta and United start hiring (for more than just a bilingual position). I have no experience as a flight attendant, and find myself wondering if I could get experience with another airline - would that make me more desirable as an applicant? Since Mesa airlines have a partnership with American and United is there a possibility of that being a good step in the door? 

&#x200B;

Or would it maybe be better to go another route by applying for a different Job with American? Getting my name and work ethic out there and known within the company, and so when there's later on a chance to apply for my desired job they know who I am, and I am doing so internally. I see that they have a Customer Assistance Representative position open, and as I have several years of customer service under my belt this wouldn't be a hard jump to make.

&#x200B;

Any advice, or opinions on this matter would be greatly appreciated."

I am looking to apply as a flight attendant for either Delta, American, or United. I'm trying to figure out which airline would be the best for me to work for, and wondered what the differences are between the three that I should be most aware of, especially as a newbie FA. I would greatly appreciate your expertise and advice as professionals in the field. :)

My plan was to apply for these companies in the fall when (I thought...) the three applications would all open at around the same time, but United just opened, so I have slightly less time than I thought to mull this all over. 

Questions I have:

1. Differences between Delta, American, and United I should consider in choosing? (Salaries, Unions, Scheduling, Time off, etc and more I wouldn't think of yet)
2. Benefits of Unionizing vs not (as I know Delta is not unionized)
3. Which airline would it be easiest to get a base out of California with? (I am definitely willing to move, but if I can be based in CA with easier access to friends and family that would be the dream.) 
4. I am a German major, and have fairly high conversational German, though I hesitate to call myself fluent- Is it worth trying to apply as Language of Destination/Bilingual? Can I apply to both bilingual and normal positions, or do I only get one application per airline?
5. (United Specific) The application for United that just opened is showing for Chicago- would it be basically guaranteed I would be placed in Chicago (initially at least)? 
6. Odds of starting out with international flights rather than domestic? (I am an International Studies major and dying to get back out into the world again:) 
7. Anything I should do to bolster my application/resume? 
   1. I have so far: Double degree in International Studies and German, a year and a half experience living in Europe with a lot of travel experience, German and Spanish Intermediate/Advanced language skills, working as a waitress now to get more customer service experience, and I am about to take an adult and pediatric CPR/AED/First Aid class.

Thank you so much to anyone who has taken the time to read this and answer any questions!!

&#x200B;

So I've been out of a job for a while and I'm excited as hell for this interview. Young, single, enjoy travelling so would really love this job! I need to crush the interview. I'm based out of Chicago interviewing for United Airlines and O'Hare is 15 minutes away from door to door.  I have some concerns regarding this position though and was hoping for insight.

&#x200B;

\- On the United page there were a ""Special Hiring Event ORD for FA"" and ""Flight Attendant ORD"" separate applications. After realizing there were two, it stated not to apply to different positions while one is active otherwise I might get disqualified. Am I at a disadvantage for not applying for the more specific app?

\- Is it common to not get a VI request? I'm going straight F2F. The Job listing is maybe 2 weeks old tops and they mentioned training beginning late March/early April. Could [this article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-united-airlines-employees-selling-travel-perks-fired-20190307-story.html) have anything to do with it? Hopefully they have multiple positions to fill for higher chance of success.

\-How likely is it to get Chicago as my base if I live here? They surely take it into account...Right?

&#x200B;

Anyway thank you and please wish me luck! Any advice other than this is greatly appreciated."

I have tried multiple times to reconcile and have made a roller-coaster of progress but, am coming to the conclusion that it may not work out. However, earlier (during an up period) I scanned and sent the family's birth certs so that we may have benefits in the future and can fly for discounted price/free (or whatever UA gives).

**Now, I am worried that my SO may one day spontaneously regret their decision while having the ability to easily take my kids and run back to their home country.** (They basically just did it to get away to flight attendant school, so there is no reason to believe that my SO wouldn't later)

29,Tips and Tricks to Get Through,32,99emol,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/99emol/tips_and_tricks_to_get_through/,8,2018-08-22 20:08:49,"Everyone keeps wanting to know the same questions, so here is my summary as best as I can get. I have posted this before in and out of other comments, and hopefully this will narrow it down and help you. I applied to 4 regionals, got 3 interviews, (one I later declined), and got both offers from the ones I interviewed with. The one regional I didn't get was because I have more than 5 jobs in 5 years, and a non-visible tattoo. So, here is my thoughts to help you:

1. If you are serious about being an FA, it might take you a year or more to get through several applications before being hired. I strongly recommend you take any medical classes like 'First Aid' or 'Basic CPR' to add to your application. (both are generally one day classes and not expensive) Airlines seem to all screen for medical and fine dining backgrounds. I was an Emergency Medical Technician, and for whatever reason, it was on every application I did and helped me get through. Also, any high end waiter jobs are also VERY helpful as is bartending. Avoid having 'too many jobs' hurt me.  **** Before even applying, know the height requirements and tattoo policy. If you are too short or too tall or have a large visible tattoo you will immediately be cut. Don't even apply and go through the process as it's a waste of your time. **** Have a MATCHING passport and state ID. We had one applicant have a married name on her papers, but her maiden name on her passport and she was going to be cut. She could prove she applied for an updated passport and made it through barely. Make sure your stuff matches.

2. Have to do a video interview? Here is what you should know. Most video interviews are of you, answering a question in under a minute from your laptop or cell phone. Some you can do over and over until you get it right. I would actually set up a test ahead of time. Use your laptop camera and video yourself against a solid wall background. Wear a blazer and shirt, and make sure the audio is clean and clear. When doing your videos, avoid 'uh's and 'um's. Speak very slowly and also if you can, write down common phrases ahead of time and sprinkle them into your video interview. Things like 'I am a great candidate for your airline because I am on time, work efficiently, and am perfect at solving customer issues to retain customer loyalty."" Sprinkle educated phrases like this ahead to seem smart and confident. Anytime you can throw in '..helping you make an informed, intelligent decision about hiring me...' goes a long way. 

3. Going to your face to face? YAY! Here is what you should know. 

(A) If you are male, shave. No beards, hipster stuff, earrings, rings, tattoos, or anything that makes you who you are. Your goal is to look like a conservative bank teller. If you are a lady, dress conservative also, no wisps of hair in your face. use lots of spray and hair gel or product and tie your hair back in a bun. Hair should be off of the neck. I think if you have braids/dreads as long as it's tied back you should be ok. No black lipstick. No dangly earrings or anything like that. Google bank teller and that's what you want to look like. Dark blazers, dark pants. Conservative. Look the part. No hipster rings on your hands, or funky watches. One ring. One watch. Maybe a bracelet but I would avoid it. 

(B). Pick your favorite paragraph from your favorite book. Stand in front of a mirror. Try and smile and read it aloud. Read it very very slowly. You will be nervous when you do it, and so your brain will want to read fast, so read slow so it sounds normal when you do it. During the interview, you will be handed a safety paragraph you will be expected to read loudly. Smile, read it aloud slowly. You may be in front of a hundred people, so I hope you are confident in being in front of lots of people. I watched an applicant get up in front of a hundred people, freeze up and cry. Don't be that applicant.

(C) Customer turnaround. Know a well thought out story about a time when you turned around an angry customer into a happy one. Be able to smile as you are saying it, and get it to about a minute long. No 'um's or 'uh's. Speak slow, and with purpose. Pretend you are a stand up comedian in that you should be active, command attention, even talk with your hands if need be. If you stand up like a frozen nervous lump, you will get cut. I actually wrote mine out so I could practice ahead of time and could recite it reasonably well. 

(D) Interview. Mention in the interview how much fun it was to learn CPR and First Aid, and how fascinated you are in learning safety procedures aboard Aircraft. Try and slip it in there when they ask you why you feel you are a great candidate. It might help you get through it. Avoid cliche stuff like 'I'm great with people'. Instead say things like 'I am a master at creating dynamic solutions on the fly to help solve issues angry customers face'. They will look for steps to turn an angry customer, like 'Listen, empthathize, apologize, and propose a solution. (L.E.A.P.)

(E) RESEARCH your airline. I guarantee they will ask you 'What do you know about us?'. Go to the airline's website and know that they operate a fleet of 150 jets and fly to over 180 US Destinations plus Canada and the Caribbean. Know they have about 5,000 employees. Know they have 5 US Bases.

(F) If they ask you if you will relocate, ALWAYS say yes. 99.9% of the time you know the base you are hired for so you know where you have to move to. You can always decline later if you are about to start training and feel you don't want to relocate. 

4. Pay. Before you even apply, make sure you have two full months of money set aside as most training is not paid. Regional training is 4 weeks and up to two weeks for your 3-day initial operating experience. This means it can be two full months before getting a paycheck. Also, $18/flight hour is NOT $18/hr but rather about $9/hr. You don't do this for the money. Regional Airlines like Compass/Endeavor Air/SkyWest/PSA/CommutAir are domestic and fly from Canada to the Bahamas. Mainline such as Delta/American/United fly internationally and can pay as much as $28/flight hour, which is substantially more. Know the money and the facts before.

Anyways, this is my summary so far. I may edit it in the future, but I hope this helps all of you get through and join me in the air. Best of luck!"

I am a few weeks out from heading to training with United Airlines for my first time as a flight attendant (!!!!!)

As this has been a lifelong dream, I'm obviously over the moon about the chance to work for United and live the dream. Here's my personal concern; I applied for this job many many months ago, before I met my amazing partner. In the middle of making many plans for travel and growth in our future, I received the email from United that I got a F2F interview. My partner was, of course, so incredibly supportive in so many ways I could have never imagined. I got the job (!!!!) and he's maintained the viewpoint of ""I'm all in, I will do whatever it takes to make this work, we'll take it one day at a time, I will need communication...etc etc""

But what I'm wondering is, how taxing is it REALLY to have your partner back in your hometown, while you are flying and relocated. (Before/if they join you is different, I'm sure, but until that point....) I'm scared to lose the person I love over the love for the lifestyle I've always dreamed of. I want to know what it's truly like to be on the move, and if those relationships really work.

38,The Flight Attendant Pay -in 9 to 5 (US airlines),14,2o6sca,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/2o6sca/the_flight_attendant_pay_in_9_to_5_us_airlines/,7,2014-12-03 23:36:11,"All aviation pay is tricky. Lets compare it to the 9 to 5 worker,as best we can. Submitting only 1st year pay, no aviation professional(pilots or fa) may receives over time, and using 80hrs as a base rate/guarantee of hrs for the month. Per diem will not be included as the federal government does not recognize it as income. Just to add, an average per diem may be  $1.75/250hrs a month to equal around 437.50 a month. Profit sharing can not be included in this scenrio as many airlines do not have a program for it or its to specific of a  program for their work groups.
(confused yet? good!)


In a month(30 day month) an average 9 to 5 worker has 8 days off and works 8hrs a day, that is 176 hrs a month. Most airlines give a set guarantee of days off and hours a month to a flight attendant. In this scenrio we will be using the 11 days off and 80hrs of pay a month. ( flight attendants can work up to 14hrs a day and receive anywhere from 4hrs of pay-8hrs of pay depending on sit times, efficiency of flights, etc)

They are likely to be looking for the same characteristics as the airlines that they work with and I'm pretty short on time to come up with a new resume, a new face, or a different life experience so unfortunately I'm gonna have to go with this same,  set lol :D I'm a very upbeat and optimistic person, but I do want to be realistic about my plans.

In theory, if I omit I have such a tattoo will either of these airlines find out if I conceal it well, while it is getting removed? Do they have someone inspect you body to look for visible tattoos?

I got video interviews for both within a week of each other. And within a week of each other I got very generic ""you haven't been selected"" e-mails. 

Notes: 1) I have short hair that's not quite to my shoulders. Didn't pin it back. Mistake?
2) I don't wear make up at all, so I didn't for either video. Mistake?

I also don't have exactly customer service experience but I tried to spin my job, I work in home healthcare, as such. Is this also hurting me? I was kinda expecting it for AA because I got really nervous and stumbled over my words, had to pause for a good 5-10 seconds. United I felt miles better about though, so it's a bummer as this is really something I want to do.

I'm going to apply to Delta-- I think it opens in June?-- and would love some insight if I made some critical mistakes. Also, no amount of googling answers my question: when United/AA open again (when?) can I immediately apply again? 

And how do I find out which companies are hiring when?

64,Future FA.,8,9ow6tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/9ow6tg/future_fa/,3,2018-10-17 10:40:28,"It's been my dream career for years to be an FA, preferably for the big three (...really partial to Delta but have had an Amazing experience with AA that has me considering my loyalties.) This is mostly because I want to work my way into the international routes. Might be a hot topic but any opinions on these three and where they rank internally?

To be completely honest I've based my past  jobs around this dream to gain experience. I've worked in nothing but customer service since I was 15. Food/retail and a five star hotel. I worked a stint as a TSA officer so I know most of the safety rules for airlines on the ground and a basic understanding of air safety as well as the unseen dangers FAs face.

I was embarrassed to say it at one point but I've had three F2F with AA. 2 with Delta. 2 with United. Then a few regional group interviews. But the more I see how competitive it is I have just been working on myself. I'm independent but I do have moments where I am more reserved. I also have a very hard time bragging on myself. I'm confident but its awkward to sell myself just because of the way I was raised. (Always taught to be extremely humble). I feel like I always undersell myself. I've been getting farther and farther the last few though. 


Anything traits that should be really focused on when speaking of myself? Generically I guess. I studied french, Japanese, and mandarin in college. I've used each in life situations but do not consider myself in anyway fluent. Is it worth mentioning these? "

As an example:  United states that they will let you know where you'll be based in the second week of training, and that you have to live within a certain distance of that airport.  Now, none of the flight attendants I know have worked in the US within the past 15 years, but those that did all lived somewhere else.  

Do they really stick to this, and is this common across airlines in the US?  Thanks much"

Does this mean don't apply if you have flight attendant applications on file with any airline or just United? So if I haven't applied with United yet, I'm okay? thanks!"
67,Question for current flight attendants,4,78blh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/78blh1/question_for_current_flight_attendants/,3,2017-10-24 02:58:36,"I have a question for some existing flight attendants.

I used to be a flight attendant for a regional airline for a few months back in 2012. I was fresh out of college and had dreams of being a flight attendant. The airline had a newer crew base where I lived, so I figured it was a perfect fit. The base was only open for a few months and then the base was terminated. I was informed that all of us would have to relocate to the IAD base. I had some personal family health issues and I was not in a spot in my life where I felt comfortable enough to relocate. The company literally only gave us a week to relocate before the base shut down. I ultimately decided to quit. I did not give the appropriate two weeks before leaving and therefore am not eligible for rehire.

I received my FAA flight attendant certificate in September 2012. I have applied for both mainline Delta and United‚Äôs flight attendant openings recently.  I do not list the regional on my resume because I feel that would only hinder my chances when they see I was a flight attendant for only a few months. 

I interviewed with mainline American about a year after I left the regional and actually got to the f2f and actually got pulled aside with a few other people to speak with additional airline representatives after they escorted a large group out. The reps asked more detailed questions about my experience at the regional and also my reasoning for leaving. I was very honest with them. After, I was very confident and thought that I had it, but ultimately got a tbnt email about a week later. 

I feel that being open about my experience and my ineligibility to be rehired definitely hurt my chances with American.

Regardless of listing the regional on my application, I am still searchable on the FAA website.  My question is, If anything did happen with Delta or United and I passed training, would already being in the FAA Database and not mentioning my previous experience be enough for them to rescind a job offer?

Any input is appreciated! Thanks!"
68,Aspiring flight attendant with a neck tattoo‚Äî American Airlines,1,acfndb,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/acfndb/aspiring_flight_attendant_with_a_neck_tattoo/,3,2019-01-04 10:01:49,"Got a F2F with AA coming up soon‚Äî also have a tattoo. A little larger than a quarter, smack on the back of my neck. It can be hidden with a neck scarf and my hair (which is a tad past my shoulders, maybe an inch, and can be nicely pinned back out of my face with Bobby pins). 

If they ask if I have any visible tattoos, do I tell them they are covered and not visible while in uniform?

This is my third face to face with a major airline in the last 6 months. United did not ask about my tattoo during the F2F, and neither did Delta. I do not want to spend 400 dollars removing my tattoo if I don‚Äôt have to- especially if I‚Äôm going to be supporting myself for 7 weeks with no pay.

Update for Delta employees: I've been a non-rev companion for the past 4 years. The employee that i've been a companion rider of was working with EasyJet. EasyJet and several other airliners had a partnership with Delta, United & American. These contracts were no renewed and now most of you flyer should see just ""DL"" airliners in the standby section. This will probably make it easier for non-revs to fly. Just thought i'd share the news."

I'm willing to part with the one of my wrist for the career choice if it comes down to it (laser removal)  but I was just curious how closely they check you for them in 2018. I've done a little research from previous posts here on reddit and other websites and it seems like United isn't as strict as some other airlines when they check for them during the hiring process. I have a friend that works for them currently and she has tattoos on her wrist but she got them after she had been working for United for a couple years and just wears long sleeves when she works now. My question is basically how hard do they check when they ask/and or physically check for tattoos? Thanks all!

Thank you in advance. The question is relating to a future trip we do not know what airlines but it most likely will be delta or United. From IAH to EWN. I just have read some people have problems with it and some don't. If I knew the reasons behind why it's prohibited I could figure out what to do.

It's a chicco key for 30 and a 15 month old he falls asleep in the car seat and the Physical therapist we had said we should always try to use one. He had a birth injury erbs palsy so now that his arm is working we are trying to keep him from getting hurt again.

It has a FAA sticker on it. I'm just not wanting to reject something or hold a plane up with un installing it after being told no.

Also if we can't use the car seat (we will need to bring two car seats 1.5 year old and 3.5 year old) anyways to drive them around

Combine all those reasons with buying a ticket for an under two year old (lap rider?) then not getting to use it.

I think the duration is 2.5 hours.

Please help I'm sorry 
I'm not being non compliant but I'm trying to figure out what to do.
