0,Diamonds: How many domestic MQMs you get this year? I'm really curious.,14,ae9bxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/ae9bxp/diamonds_how_many_domestic_mqms_you_get_this_year/,36,2019-01-09 20:52:02,"I'm really curious how many other people fly domestically as much as I do. I've been Diamond since 2008 when they started the 4-tier system. But I've always flown United as my second airline and maintained a Platinum status with them, even making 1K one year in 2012. I decided to only get Silver with United this past year and have upped my Delta flights because of this. Delta is way better anyway!

I'm based out of the PNW and fly to the east coast a lot and hit 176,656 MQMs (~21,000 rollover), 141 MQSs, and $22,553 MQDs. On United I had 29,185 PQMs, as well as ~11,000 miles on Alaska, and a measly 1,302 EQMs on American. A grand total of about 197,143 if I did my math correctly.

P.S. I quit spending on my Reserve card because eff that $250k!"
1,Flew First Class for the First Time Today,41,d1lvb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/d1lvb8/flew_first_class_for_the_first_time_today/,29,2019-09-09 08:11:04,"I started a new job in February where I have to fly from my home airport of GSP to BOS and back once a month, which through Delta usually necessitates a connection in ATL. Before February, I've only flown a handful of times over the years. 

My company's reimbursement policy is for ""the most economical fare class available"" and anything above that comes out of my pocket, but they do reimburse for checked bags. I started out flying Basic Economy, but after a couple of months figured out that Main Cabin was also reimbursed with no issues. 

Last month, the hotel that is recommended by my company was booked up and I found a bundle deal on Expedia for a slightly-less-fancy hotel and Comfort+ that was cheaper than just the normal rate for the recommended hotel. I did the same thing this month, but the bundle included a First Class ticket from GSP-BOS and Comfort+ on the return trip on Friday. Plus, since it was a bundle, I paid for the hotel + airfare weeks ago and have already been reimbursed by my company so there were no issues with my bundle deal making it past the bean counters.

I think I'm ruined for Main Cabin and Comfort+ now. I'm a bigger guy, and having the extra space in First Class where I never touched the person sitting next to me was by-far the best perk. Here's how I rate the rest of the experience. 

Great perks for First Class: 

* All the space. Since only two seats go into a section the width of three seats in C+ and Main Cabin, the seats are wider, there's almost a foot of armrest ""neutral ground"" between the two seats, and there was plenty of legroom. I actively avoid putting my backpack under the seat when possible because it always takes legroom away, but I don't think I would have even noticed it today. The seats also recline further, but I usually don't recline my seat so I didn't test this out.

* Free priority checked bags - I normally just bring a carry-on to avoid extra fees that I sometimes gate check, but this time I checked my carry-on and with the little yellow ""Priority"" tag on bag it was one of the first off the plane. Once I deplaned, went to the bathroom, and made it to the baggage pickup area, my bag was waiting on me. A great experience.

* Drink Service before take-off - It's awesome to get a drink before you take off. Normally, I'm used to grabbing a coffee or soda to bring onto the plane on main cabin, because it can take a while to take off and get to cruising speed, plus another 20+ min for the cart to get to my location, but in First you don't have to think about it. Just show up, board, and get whatever you want within 5-10 min. Awesome. 

* Multiple free drinks - I get a single free drink in C+, but it was nice on my flight from ATL-BOS to get a coffee w/ Baileys, a Bloody Mary, and a Bourbon and Coke Zero. 

* Drink service in first even when the rest of the plane doesn't get a drink service. The short 30-min hop from GSP to ATL never gets a drink service, but I had two coffees with Baileys in first, one pre-flight and another in the air. Awesome. 

* Free meal - I received an email a few days ago asking about my meal preference, and I chose a chicken sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. It came with a fruit plate and Chobani blueberry yogurt. It's no different than any other meal I could have gotten in the airport for $12, but I didn't have to worry about finding a meal before boarding. It was nice to just walk around during my layover without getting into long lines for food while trying to make a connection. 

* Pillow and blanket - first class domestic passengers get a little pillow and a blanket. The pillow made the already-comfortable seat even better. I didn't use the blanket, but it seemed decent. Another advantage of first class - you don't have to plan ahead to bring these things—just show up. 

* Flight Attendant attention - the flight attendant for First Class routinely checked to see if any of us needed anything. It felt like being at a nice restaurant rather than having your meal dropped off at a QSR. The attendant on both flights was also much more personable than in my previous non-FC flights.

* 150% mileage - a great bonus. I'm going to hit silver by EOY (I flew a few times on AA and United to figure out which airline to commit to), but this will help out greatly next year when I chase gold. 

Not awesome, but still nice: 

* When my boarding pass was scanned, the flight attended took the time to look at me, saying ""Enjoy your flight, Mr. <Amator>. I've never had that happen before on a flight. 

* Small water bottles waiting on the seat tray. Nice to have early in the morning when I was a bit thirsty and could have an immediate drink. 

* The armrest with built-in cup tray. It was nice to have a place for the drinks to sit without having to extend the table. 

* The table was a fold-out from the armrest and not the standard seat-back tray table. This way, I didn't have to worry about someone leaning back in their seat and spilling my drink. 

* Little niceties like ceramic cups for coffee, cloth napkins, hot towel, and a little tablecloth for the fold out table. 

* Extra pockets in the seat back - gave me a place to park my Kindle and phone while I watched IFE on these flights.

* First class lavatory - I didn't use this on either flight, but first class gets its own lav so you don't have to wait and I've heard the amenities are a bit nicer.

All in all, I feel like FC has ruined me for other seating classes. I'm going to try and book a similar package with FC flights on both legs of the trip in the future. All of the other little perks are really nice, but having the extra space is definitely the best reason for me to fly FC."

Holy shit, I get treated better in economy on Delta than I am today in business on AA today.  I’m going to pick future vacation locations based on the airlines that fly there.  If I have to fly AA or United, I’m vacationing somewhere else."
3,Am I in the wrong program?,0,cwegko,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cwegko/am_i_in_the_wrong_program/,16,2019-08-28 06:15:49,"Hello.  I'm happy to have found this subreddit!  I have a new job this year that has me traveling internationally quite a bit.  My company allows me to book business class and since January I've spent about $45K MQD and just became Diamond.  It's been 25 yrs since I was a frequent flyer and I'm awestruck at the complexity and limitations of the skymiles program.   Simple things like an upgrade certificate are NOT simple.  Regional vs continental vs domestic vs US upgrade certs.  Which fares you can and can't use them with.  When you can use them, where you are in priority queue etc. 

Beyond the complexity issue, there is fundamental value to me as a frequent flyer. As a Diamond member, I get complimentary domestic upgrades, but I don't fly domestically so this is of no value, and I get almost nothing for Global flights.  I can get 4 global upgrades which would be nice I guess to move me from Business to First on a partner carrier with a special first class(that's probably not allowed, I don't even know) but I'd like to actually use it for a global trip with my family, but that doesn't work because there are 5 of us and I'd have to buy a fare class that's 50%+ more expensive to be eligible for an upgrade and unless you book 364 days out you are unlikely to find flights with upgrade slots available?

I am flying to Europe with my wife this weekend actually.  We could have purchased ecomomy class ticket for $1100, but had to pay $1700 for a ticket that was eligible to upgrade with miles.  65K points each, each way (not including the inter Europe portion after a connection which is economy) totaling 260K miles.  I have not accumulated enough miles so far this year so we are flying home economy.  You see when you fly partner airlines you get some diminished value of points (don't ask me how this is calculated) and often if you book Delta to Seoul, for example, the fare is $6K for Korean Airlines and $8K for Delta(codeshare with Korean Air)  So the same flight is 40% more booking on Delta vs the partner airline.  I have to do the right thing for my company and book the Korean Air flight, but I get dinged on points?? 

Bottom line....My $45K MQD isnt even enough to get 2 business class upgrade to Europe.  I get no value on my global flights and I'm going to spend about $100K with Delta on flights this year and when I fly to Australia with my family next spring, I'm going to fly economy with another carrier.  I want to be loyal to a carrier!  I will pay extra to my carrier and even do stopovers to stick to a carrier, but Delta is certainly not that carrier for me!

I think maybe I'm with the wrong carrier?  I've been told that United is the better program for international travelers like myself?  I expect their program will be equally complex but hopefully that the benefits will align better with my goals for rewards and be more valuable for the type of travel I do.  I'm planning on doing the status match and moving to United starting in January.  I'd welcome your thoughts."
4,Question about TSA PreCheck,3,8vocjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/8vocjv/question_about_tsa_precheck/,11,2018-07-03 05:53:21,"Hey everyone,

I'm going to be flying on Delta from Sacramento to Atlanta tomorrow. About a month ago, I flew from Sacramento to Pennsylvania on United, and I was eligable for PreCheck, as it was printed on my boarding pass.

Does TSA PreCheck stay with you, even when transferring to another airline? I don't believe I did anything sketchy / had any change in personal info that may void me of PreCheck.

Thanks!

*Edit:* I printed out the boarding passes for me and my brother (who is most likely also eligible for PreCheck), but there was no check mark or symbol saying we have PreCheck.

*Another Edit:* So I got it randomly during the last trip; that explains a lot actually, despite how weird the system is lol. Thank you for those who responded! Fly safely :)"
5,An Open Letter Regarding Corporate Social Responsibility,0,81ugzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/81ugzs/an_open_letter_regarding_corporate_social/,9,2018-03-04 04:04:42,"To Whom It May Concern:




As regards the current state of affairs in which our collective State/Federal government/s and societal interest groups find themselves, I must say that I am truly not that surprised or unappreciative of the possibilities/opportunities that the political-economic system of the United States now affords us. I refer, of course, to the rising wave of organizational political consciousness that has sprung from some unforeseen depths following the tragic deaths of 17 persons on Feb. 14, 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Highschool in Parkland, Florida. 

This event has once again shaken the American public to depths of despair that are always of the most grievous of magnitudes. And once again, as the people come together to air their grievances publicly, clearly, and loudly to their government officials, they are met with open arms to extensive hearings, platitudes, assurances, and half-hearted measures drug forward and discussed by equally half-hearted legislators. It seems that we are doomed to waiting until the next mass-shooting to give it another shot.

But wait, amidst the dark and bleak routine in which we have found ourselves, something interesting rears its head: economic powerhouses such as Delta Airlines, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, MetLife, Symantec, et al. publicly, perhaps even brazenly, rebuking those who many within their stakeholder groups see as central to the gun crises of the United States. The subject of the collective ire is, who else, but the National Rifle Association (NRA); an organization that has spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars obstructing and repealing legislature aimed at preventing these tragedies and many others like them from happening in the first place. 

Now, this is not some rant about how we “need to bring down the NRA and those money-grubbing politicians who support them” or anything of the sort. Frankly, I truly cannot blame the NRA membership for exercising their Constitutional Rights to collective reasoning, discussion, and representation (i.e. founding/joining interest groups) and allowing the organization to represent and bargain for them in the political arena. We all have these same Rights as both members of the United States of America as well as the greater human species and we all exercise them to whatever degree we see fit. We honestly cannot begrudge the NRA member for their membership as it is none of our business nor concern why they have entrusted their voice to and provided a platform to the NRA.

Similarly, I cannot blame the companies (and their many predecessors who forged ahead and stood against societal ailments, wrongs, and barriers before them) for doing as they are and removing policies regarding politically contentious/sensitive organizations. As organizations, and people themselves , these companies are exercising their own Rights to express themselves as they see fit.

Some companies, of which Delta  seems to be the most recent and sharply relevant example, experience the costs and penalties associated with breaking the norms and mores of the special interest group—business/economic enterprise—legislative bargaining policy-making dynamic (Figure: 1) that exists in contemporary neoliberal economies. 

Costs come in many forms and can never truly be predicted when an organization takes a risk and publicly acts against a powerful special interest. For some, it means simply losing face in the endless war of public opinion and for others it may mean losing suppliers or a shifting customer base. For some though, that risk results in a not insubstantial and immediate legislative blowback in the form of a $40-million tax break being shredded by Georgia State lawmakers.

This is where things get truly interesting. For, as collaboratively devastating and hopeful as this collective chain of events has been in terms of the “debate” on guns in the United States, it still wasn’t anything new up to this point. There are serious implications and social precedents being set in this rapidly unfolding story. When legislators decide to throw a thinly-veiled fit and trash an economically feasible and widely-favored proposal over a perceived political opinion/action, they send a dangerous message (read: threat) to any organizations who wish to exercise their right to political speech contrary to larger benefactors.

The legislative response to Delta’s policy change, escalates tensions between legislators and their business-counterparts by drawing a proverbial line in the sand and standing squarely behind a wall of implied-consequence. It is an intriguing and unforeseen move by the legislators and it can truly be interpreted only one way by business leaders: this is the point where conversation ends. Delta Airlines has now become an example of the limits of governmental patience when dealing with organizational speech. 

There is, however, an obvious problem here in that as long as these legislators are acting in their capacities as elected representatives, they are making decisions in the name and interest of their respective constituencies. Their sabre-rattling is therefore that of their voters and we now must ask: who are the constituents of these politicians? Their electorates or their economic benefactors?

And although I don’t truly buy the “politically divisive nature” argument Delta, you are doing the right thing in instigating a movement to disassociate business interests, legislative organs, and special interest groups in the United States. The fact is that these relationships have just gotten a little too cozy in recent years. Just look at the business-political “revolving-door” if you aren’t quite sure of the problem. And sure, it is good for them to get along and be friendly, but a good friend also lets you know when something needs to be addressed. In Delta et al.’s public disassociation with the NRA, they are doing just that.

It is my hopes, as well as why I have written this open letter, that this inspires a larger trend among business lobbies. Now that legislators have very openly shown the new game that is to be played, I implore organizations to begin to take similar stands across all industries and socio-political stances. You cannot allow yourselves to be subjected to the will and blackmail of vindictive legislators who act according to those with the largest checkbook. And in the name of “not taking sides” in the political turmoil of the United States of America, you must openly declare who it is that you are not aligned with. You, and companies like you, are some of the most powerful players in the court of public opinion and it is time you start utilizing that influence.

If this does not sufficiently appeal to your sense of corporate social responsibility, let me offer some economic incentives as well. This is largely a battle of public opinion and as the clever business-people you are, you know that perception is a key driver to profits and long-term economic viability. Understanding and anticipating the needs, wants, and expectations of customers is the name of the game and right now, the public is clearly saying one thing: “it is time to act on gun safety in the USA.” 

Now while the singular act of removing the NRA discount was largely symbolic and likely will have limited impacts for Delta, it adds to a collection of actions that collaboratively change the image of an organization in the eyes of the public. By working together across industries and contexts, large companies can profit simply by not being a competitor. And while everyone wishes that political stance/affinity wasn’t a primary driver in consumer decisions, we all know that it is. 

Therefore, I think all of us (both organization and consumer alike) should think very long and hard about what the Delta-Georgia-NRA fiasco is telling us about the current state-of-affairs in the legislative halls of the United States of America. Legislators are not only clearly showing their bias, they are openly acting upon it in their capacities as representatives. Meanwhile organizations who appeal to public opinion (inadvertently or otherwise) are publicly chastised for doing so. 

The social context in which this has taken place is definitively tragic. The easily preventable deaths of 17 human beings and the terrorization of countless others should never be the engine by which we achieve legislative change; the fact that we find ourselves in this position again is frankly sickening and that we are still having this conversation is akin to psychological torment. 

Companies: take this opportunity to affect real change across our great country. For those economic conglomerates out there, what benefit do you stand from “remaining neutral?” 

The root of the problem is systemic. The sickness may be symptomized in the lawmakers, but its causes lie deep within our socio-political cultures and socio-legal structures. And while I am aware of the legal and political implications of limiting political spending (i.e. “speech” ), we must find ways to make the effects proportionate across parties and stakeholders if we are to maintain the legitimacy of and trust in our governmental processes. The threat of legislative blackmail through virtually unrestricted political spending by disproportionately influential interest groups and PACs is a threat to everyone’s security, well-being, and opportunity.

6,Cancelled Flight Today- First time Delta let me down in last 219 flights!,3,axfxq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/axfxq8/cancelled_flight_today_first_time_delta_let_me/,9,2019-03-05 05:36:26,"Yes, I have flown 219 segments with Delta in last 12 months. I know all the ins and outs of travel with Delta and they are definitely my preferred carrier in the US and transcontinental. 

My flight today was cancelled 3 hours in advance due to equipment issues. I appreciated the advance notice and was actually thinking last night of switching flights and routes today to accommodate my schedule. 

Lo and behold, Delta couldn’t find another flight for me today on their metal and rebooked me on United. I am grateful that they went ahead and did this, don’t get me wrong. 

My issue is that I always pay for Comfort+ and had received an upgrade to first class, as usual, 5 days prior, however when Delta rebooked me on United, I was put in the last row of coach, middle seat, for an east coast to west coast 6.5 hour trip. I called Delta and was told that their carriage contracts with their customers and with the other airlines only requires a seat, not class accommodation when receiving a courtesy rebooking. I could care less about losing the upgrade but at 6’ tall I wanted the class of service I paid for. I searched United and they were selling Economy+ seats so availability wasn’t an issue. 

Never have I been rebooked on another carrier’s equipment so this was a brand new experience for me. 

Also, since I am TSA PreCheck, but not enrolled with United, I was also to use the regular security lanes and strip down and empty briefcase and toiletries, etc. a major inconvenience for me plus having to wait in a long line. 

Interested if anyone has had a similar experience or am I a whiny entitled Diamond member? 😥

7,Delta says the next big battle between airlines will take place on the ground,16,cgf5zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cgf5zw/delta_says_the_next_big_battle_between_airlines/,7,2019-07-22 20:09:33,"* **Recent profits and a strong U.S. economy are giving airlines the opportunity to invest more in the airport experience.**
* **Many airports are setting new monthly passenger records.**
* **Delta thinks it can get a leg up on the competition as the edge on fares and in-cabin services becomes more limited.**

&#x200B;

 [*https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/delta-says-next-big-battle-between-airlines-will-be-on-the-ground.html*](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/delta-says-next-big-battle-between-airlines-will-be-on-the-ground.html) 

 

The airline industry is experiencing strong financial performance — [Delta Air Lines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DAL) recently hit a record stock price, and [United Airline Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UAL) grew profits in its latest earnings as the U.S. economy continues its decade-long run.

In fact, airline industry conditions are so good, longtime airline-stock hater Warren Buffett of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BRK.A) became one of the sector’s biggest investors in recent years after a wave of consolidation brought the fleets closer to the almost monopoly conditions he looks for in businesses.

But other recent highs in air travel are not so positive: Airports all over the country are setting new records in monthly passenger levels, making the airport experience one of the worst “legs” in a traveler’s journey. As a result, major airlines flush with money for reinvestment are making the on-the-ground experience a greater focus of their efforts to out-compete rival carriers.

“I think the next area of competition in air travel is in the airport,” Paul Jacobson, executive vice president and CFO of Delta said at the [CNBC @Work Human Capital + Finance conference](https://www.cnbc.com/work/) in Chicago last Tuesday. “How do you continue to streamline the on-the-ground experience. It is a big part of how passengers rate the experience.”

In major metro areas the two biggest issues in airport satisfaction are access to the airport (with so many major airports far from city centers) and the terminal itself, at No. 1, according to J.D. Power.

“The most common PR headline from any airport any month is ‘X airport sets new monthly passenger record,’” said Mike Taylor, J.D. Power’s travel practice leader.

But that does not necessarily mean it is good PR with so many airports so dated.

 

There are some aspects of the airport experience that airlines can’t do anything about. Only 6% more airports have been built in the U.S. since 1980, despite 181% more domestic passengers.

“They can’t build another four-lane highway to the airport,” Taylor said. “Most of the airports are shoehorned into areas never meant to handle this much traffic.”

Those problems don’t end once at the airport, either: Many parking lots closest to terminals at some of the busiest U.S. airports are now completely full and closed on multiple days per week. This is the type of on-the-ground frustration that leads to missed flights, and missed flights lead to the blame being placed all around.

“People are more stressed on the airport and airlines side of things, and they blame both,” Taylor said.

For the airlines like Delta, it does not matter that some of the terminal experience is beyond their control. Taylor said that when an aircraft closes and sits on the ground because the FAA is holding them there, passengers do not complain about the FAA. “They paid the airline, and they pick up the cocktail napkin and swear at it.”

Scott Mayerowitz, executive editorial director of travel information site The Points Guy, said the airport experience is unique in the travel journey as being so bad, and it is an important part of the journey that is underexamined. “Until my head hits the pillow in a hotel room, I am on the go, and it all matters,” Mayerowitz said.

Delta is collecting as much data as it can from passengers to improve the travel experience. [“We survey everything,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/whats-the-most-stressful-part-of-your-trip-delta-wants-to-know.html) Jacobson told those attending the CNBC event in Chicago. “A lot of that comes down to the psychology of the customer and understanding what each leg in the journey makes the customer feel like.”

## Wall Street is watching

Wall Street is focusing more on the airport experience in its analysis of airline stocks. Hunter Keay, a Wolfe Research analyst who covers Delta, wrote that the Delta CFO is correct in his focus on the airport as a competitive key. Keay wrote in a late 2018 research note that Delta’s major investment in “investment-starved airports” like New York City’s LaGuardia “are not so much an act of generosity but a strategic decision that we believe will further widen DAL’s competitive advantage to peers by driving up costs for marginal competitors there that lack scale, pricing power, or both. ... This is literally a 20-year competitive advantage DAL is building today, arguably the hardest one yet for competitors to copy.”

Delta is investing $12 billion over a five-year period investing in its airport infrastructure, primarily at New York City’s LaGuardia, Los Angeles International, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

“Airports have always been a challenge for airlines who haven’t been able to crack that code due to more pressing capital needs internally, fear of committing to longer-term, big dollar projects due to business cycle risk with questionable balance sheets, or the challenges of driving buy-in or consensus with the government agencies that run these airports. But it seems to us that DAL is figuring this thing out,” Keay wrote.

One of the terminal chokepoints where Delta made an investment is through a stake it owns in biometric screening company Clear. Jacobson pointed to the Clear investment as part of its efforts to streamline the passenger experience through investments in technology. “We’ve made big bets in technology in the past few years thinking we can turn it around into revenue generation,” the Delta CFO said at the CNBC event. Jacobson said technology like Clear should ultimately improve the experience beyond the security checkpoint.

“I think ultimately the technology around identification, whether facial recognition or fingerprints, is coming to all transactions,” Jacobson said.

“Delta has recognized that security is a horrible headache for people,” Mayerowitz said. “[Clear is at many more airports](https://www.clearme.com/where-we-are/?p=GOOGBRAEX&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwmtDpBRAQEiwAC6lm4_5SRPJeH1iXNFpzLmr3hK4Db775gDPmp55sLlbhgVcATBnYKT0vjxoCr-EQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) than before because of the Delta investment, and they’ve done saturation at their key hubs. ”

Mayerowitz, who is a Clear member, added, “In two to three minutes at LGA or JFK, I can make it from the curb to the other side of security. Clear gets me to the front of the precheck line, and I just put my bag in and walk through and I’m done.”

## The timing is right for airlines

A focus on future revenue is one of the reasons why Delta is making the investments now, before a recession hits and operating conditions weaken.

Yael Taqqu, a senior partner at management consultant McKinsey, who spoke on a panel with Jacobson at CNBC’s @Work Human Capital + Finance conference, said investments like the ones Delta is making now are designed to be “revenue enhancements” out ahead of the next downturn. “In a downturn, the wedge between digital haves and have nots, which is already wide, will get wider,” said Taqqu.

Taylor said the timing is right from an airline industry perspective too. “You have to have three things happen to really expand airports. The economy has to be good, the airline has to be making money, and policies have to be right. These days, we have all three of them working in the airlines favor. ... When they are not making money, those things get put on hold. They would like to have everything set up for the passenger to be happy before getting on the craft.”

Airlines also are running out of ways to improve and “disaggregate” — price-tier — the in-cabin experience.

“Right now airlines have healthy profits and are reinvesting,” Mayerowitz said. “Delta likes to brag that they have the most inflight seatback TVs of any airline, and they’ve built a business around what they say is a superior product in the sky, and it commands a revenue premium, people willing to spend $10-$15 extra. But at the end of the day, there is only so much you can do to increase costs in the sky.” He added of Delta’s focus on the terminal, “They are right, especially as airlines cram more seats into planes and come up with hideous slim-line bathrooms just so they can get an extra row of seats in.”

Delta is among the airlines that have cut down bathroom size in some cabins to add an extra back row.

Some of the on-the-ground improvements won’t be available to all passengers — in fact, they are designed to find ways within the terminal to extract greater revenue and reward elite levels of passengers.

“Space dedicated to lounges will continue to grow,” Taylor said. “They are looking for more space in which to hand out perks and do the same thing as they are doing in the cabin ... and trying to monetize some of it.”

Mayerowitz, who holds 19 credit cards offering access to many different terminal lounges, said that frequent flyers need better club options because classic lounges at big city terminals can often be “packed.”

Lounge investment is not limited to the airlines. [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AXP) has its own series of luxury lounges for elite car holders, the Centurion Lounge. “Centurion has really upped the game in design and food offering,” Mayerowitz said.

Airlines including American Airlines and United (Polaris Lounge) have added multiple-tiers of lounges in addition to the classic options (e.g. AA’s Admirals Club).

“The lounge is crowded for most of these airlines and they are trying to differentiate it. ... If you’re paying $10,000 for a one-way flight, you better be getting something better than a $450 traveler on the same trip. That’s why they have separate entrances for check in,” Mayerowitz said. He added that international travel already features some of these perks, but a passenger flying domestic will has not historically seen this level of service except to limited cross-country routes.

Luxury perks also have extended to travel between terminals. United offers Mercedes Benz cars for elite passengers that need to transfer between terminals for ground connections, a perk that Mayerowitz says can make quite an impression. “Elite members are whisked in these luxury cars around big planes to their next flights.”

Delta offers Porsches; [American Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAL) uses Cadillacs.

All the airlines will spend “multi billions of dollars,” in all, Taylor said.

Better food offerings and private dining on demand for top-tier travelers is coming. “Why have cheese cubes and crackers at the lounge when you can pay for fresh made?” Mayerowitz said. His credit card collections makes sure he always has options and he is seeing more of the benefits as lounges improve.

“I was just in Las Vegas and went to a lounge, got in thanks to my Chase Sapphire Reserve card, and it was great. Nice views and good snacks and a perfect place to unwind before heading out on the next part of my journey.”

But there are limits to how far the airport improvement era can take the passenger.

Mayerowitz is not getting his hopes up too much. “Airports are just pretty bus terminals. There is only so much you can do.”"
8,Receiving texts for Delta flights I am not on?,8,an4wq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/an4wq4/receiving_texts_for_delta_flights_i_am_not_on/,7,2019-02-04 21:55:32,"Hello r/delta,

Hoping to catch the attention of someone at Delta Airlines for an answer here as calling customer service was ineffectual to say the least..

I have for the last week now been receiving text messages from a message service alerting me of either gate changes or ETDs for various flights leaving LGA Terminal C

&#x200B;

I have not been to New York in close to 10 years and haven't flown since October of last year to Denver and that was on United I am not sure when the last time I even flew on a Delta flight tbh.  I seem to be getting a decent amount of them so either someone has entered in my number erroneously or my identity has/is compromised.

I have no confirmation numbers or anything other than a few flight numbers and gate/terminal numbers.  The texts come from the number 245-28 which brings up nothing on any search I do so I have no idea what ""service"" to call.

I called Delta customer service and they informed me they cannot look up my phone number in such a manner in the system and I was promptly forwarded a few times to various departments only to start over again at the beginning of the phone tree.  I tried again, was told the same info from another CS employee.

&#x200B;

I figure I could text STOP but may want to use the service myself if I ever find myself flying Delta in the future.  Really just hoping to find a way to see if someone else is using my number (maybe they would also like it corrected to receive the text?) or to verify someone isn't using my phone number in some nefarious manner that could come back to haunt me later.

&#x200B;

Does anyone in redditland know if there is a way for me to  figure this out?  I would greatly appreciate any serious thoughts here."

We always fly Delta, but they don't seem to fly to the remote village she needs to go to (Kotzebou, AK). Looks like only 3 airlines fly in there - and the only one I've heard of is Alaska.

Is there any way we can make it most of the way on Delta? I'd hate to book multiple tickets and then due to a delay miss a connection in Fairbanks, but the alternative seems to be going United all the way.

Any thoughts/suggestions?"
11,"An update to my months old post, AKA why i just book delta now",25,97fytu,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/97fytu/an_update_to_my_months_old_post_aka_why_i_just/,2,2018-08-15 10:11:48,"So a couple months ago I posted here about trying to get my wife to Kotzebue, Alaska for her artist residency. (https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/8d2fg6/flying_to_the_middle_of_nowhere_alaska/)

Delta doesn't fly there so there were good suggestions about just booking a big layover in anchorage. Unfortunately that didn't work out as she needed to be ASAP after alaska in a wedding. So we ended up booking a united flight. 

On the way out it was delayed, I was on hold for 45 minutes only to get told I had to contact a partner airline of united. That seemed odd. But I called them, only to have them tell me that since United owned the ticket they couldn't do anything.

Another 45 minutes on hold and we were finally able to rebook my wife to a flight some 12 hours later.

Now, right before she's scheduled to fly back she get's a google alert saying her departing leg is canceled. No word from united on her overall ticket. I call them and wait 45 minutes on hold. They say that it's not their problem, since it's a carrier out of alaska. I remind them they own the ticket, so they need to make it work.

After another hour(!) on hold they tell me they've rebooked her but she's going to have to leave 12 hours early and is getting in to the next city she's traveling to over 16 hours early. And they won't give her a hotel voucher.

I told the CS agent that I was texting with my wife and that she wasn't happy. The United CS agent said that at least they were getting her out of Alaska.

All in all, a terrible performance from United. So why am I posting this on the Delta subreddit?

Well I told the CS agent that we usually fly delta, and only because Delta didn't fly to the middle of nowhere Alaska we ended up booking United. She said ""well if your wife knew what  we spent to rebook her she'd be a fan of us"".

Such garbage. We just booked two more fall trips through delta. Thanks for the great customer service, delta! You don't make loyal customers when everything goes great, it's how you deal with adversity. And that's why I book Delta even if it's a bit more."
