I was removed from a plane and my rebooking was greater than two hours, and the airline paid me 400% of the one way ticket value. What’s worse is that they are supposed to cut you a check at the gate, but the agent didn’t tell me and I didn’t know. I asked for a partial refund once I got home and the customer service agent said sorry nothing we can do, even after I told them of me being kicked off. Begrudgingly I accepted it, a few days later, just out of curiosity I googled removal from plane policies and that link popped up from DOT. I submitted a claim with them and told the airlines of the regulation, and a few weeks later I was told I would be getting a check for over 900$.  Yay."

5,Who gets booted first due to airline overbooking (in light of United Airlines incident),40,64lun9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/64lun9/who_gets_booted_first_due_to_airline_overbooking/,67,2017-04-10 23:41:12,"Hey everyone, I'm not a regular to /r/travel, but I think I have a little research others might find valuable. In light of the [doctor being violently dragged off of a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/64jmub/doctor_violently_dragged_from_overbooked_united/) and the resulting social media backlash, I decided to do some digging into what airlines do when it comes to overbooking. All of the below information came from each individual airline's Contract of Carriage, which can be found on their websites (I've provided links to the ones I researched). Naturally I'm not going to have everyone's preferred airline, so don't hate on me too bad if I didn't include your go-to. 

Per regulations, every airline asks for volunteers to give up their spot for compensation. After that, airlines can set their own rules to decide who gets left behind. Now then, in no particular order...

**United Airlines** looks at several variables: Fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and time of check-in without advanced seat assignment. Basically if you're not a loyal customer and/or early bird, you might not want to get too comfortable in your seat. [Read United's full policy here - Rule 25](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec25)

**Southwest Airlines** is pretty simple. The person in the last boarding position will be denied boarding, regardless of fare. [Read Southwest's full policy here - Page 39](https://www.southwest.com/assets/pdfs/corporate-commitments/contract-of-carriage.pdf)

**American Airlines** bases the decision primarily on check-in time, but also takes severe hardships, fare paid, and frequent flyer status into consideration sometimes as well. [Read American's full policy here](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#oversales)

**Delta Airlines** has a pretty complex policy. Essentially, if you paid a premium fare, you have nothing to worry about. That said, passengers with boarding passes are safer than those who don't have them or didn't check in. In those cases, rebooked passengers or frequent flyers are safer than a passenger who didn't check in and doesn't have a boarding pass. Exception: Special needs passengers (disabilities, unaccompanied minors, etc.) are likely good to go no matter what. [Read Delta's full policy here - Rule 245 on Page 42](http://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract_of_carriage_dom.pdf)

**Frontier Airlines** has a policy about as simple as Southwest. Passengers who check in after all seats have been assigned won't get a seat. [Read Frontier's full policy here](https://www.flyfrontier.com/legal/contract-of-carriage/)

**Alaska Airlines** favors the early bird. Anyone with a confirmed seat assignment won't get booted. Don't have one? Show up early and you're more likely to get a seat. [Read Alaska's full policy here](https://www.alaskaair.com/~/media/Files/PDF/contract-of-carriage/Alaska-Airlines-Contract-of-Carriage.pdf?INT=AS_Legal_||20160816_CoC_ENG||)

**So you've been involuntarily bumped. Now what?** If they can still get you to your destination within an hour on a different flight, airlines aren't required to pay you anything. If you get there between 60-119 minutes after your scheduled arrival, you're owed 200% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $675). If you arrive 120 minutes or longer, you're owed 400% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $1350). There's other small print to go through, but that's the gist.

Hopefully this is a little bit helpful. It was somewhat eye-opening to realize that this wasn't just a United Airlines thing."
6,Possibly flying Wow Airlines. Are they as bad as their online reviews suggest?,26,7qjyuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7qjyuz/possibly_flying_wow_airlines_are_they_as_bad_as/,64,2018-01-15 17:24:49,"I'm planning a trip from Detroit to Reykjavik and the cheapest possible option to do that is on Wow Airlines. I understand that it's a budget airline, so I will have to pay for literally anything beyond the seat I'm sitting in. After reading the online reviews I am skeptical to fly with them. 

I am not checking any luggage so I am not concerned with lost items. My biggest concern is flight delays, as that seems to be a pretty frequent complaint. 

The trip is the first week of September so there shouldn't be any weather delays but I am unsure if it's worth saving $500-$800 flying with Wow instead of Delta/United if travel delays are that commonplace. 

Does anyone have any experience flying on Wow Airlines? Any advice on whether we should save the money and book Wow versus spending extra to fly a more reputable airline? "
7,Too Much Free Time: Here's The Ultimate List of Money Saving Tips for Travel,274,60ammm,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/60ammm/too_much_free_time_heres_the_ultimate_list_of/,58,2017-03-19 19:40:31,"One of the beauties of being self-employed and living in the boonies is the option to spend the better part of a day compiling shit posts for Reddit while cuddling with your cat.

While I sincerely hope this post is far from shit, here goes – The Ultimate List of Money Saving Tips for Travel

**Flights**

- First and foremost…[Read the /r/travel Airfare Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/airfare) – You’ll soon be transformed into a cheap flight guru and save /u/jippiejee an ulcer in the process.

- Sign up for airline newsletters: I know your inbox is already overflowing with crap from JCPenny’s & Old Navy but some of the cheapest tickets I’ve ever purchased were direct from the airlines during a flash sale. This technique is especially good for domestic flights or shorter international routes.

- Get to know the budget airlines serving your hub or hubs you plan to visit. Most of these airlines don’t show up on flight search engines….WOW, Wizz, etc. Just Google <budget airlines *airport name*>.

- [Sign up for Scott’s Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/) – Also, http://www.secretflying.com/ & http://www.theflightdeal.com/

- Roll the Dice with 3rd Party Booking Sites: OTAs will bend you over without lube should a situation arise where you need to access Customer Service – but if you’re 100% sure of your dates/times and are capable of spelling your name correctly, there are plenty of scenarios where CheapoAir, Expedia or Travelocity do find goofy flight options that are significantly cheaper than booking direct. Travelers willing to endure brutal layovers to save a few hundred bucks can score killer deals. Don’t rely on OTAs but don’t totally discount them during your flight search, either.

- [Massage Google Flights’ prostate:](https://www.google.com/flights/) [Here’s a good article from the Liberal Elite](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/entry/google-flights-tips-tricks_us_58062e82e4b0b994d4c1675a) on giving Google Flights the finger in a good way – Google Flights is a utensil you can’t afford to leave off your tool belt.

- Ask your parents for loads of free money: YMMV with this one. I’ve never had any luck with it but I’ve seen plenty of folks doing Yoga poses on rocks who have.

- [Listen to the fine people at Skyscanner.](https://www.skyscanner.net/news/20-money-saving-travel-tips-and-secrets) They certainly know what they’re on about.

- I don’t personally do it but /r/churning/ provides plenty with a MASSIVE travel boner.

- Try to be as flexible as you can…search for flights using the flight calendar whenever possible. The exact same flight from the same airline can often be 1/2 the price with just a 2-3 day shift.

**Accommodation**

- To get a nicer hotel room at a deep discount, [give Hotwire Hot Rates a go.]( http://hotwire.com/) A similar system is available at https://www.priceline.com/

- Search rooms on Booking.com but then contact hotels direct to see if they’ll meet/match that price. Properties lose fat commissions to booking sites and can be open to negotiating, particularly if it’s a small owner-run place.

- https://www.booking.com/ is also a pretty good resource straight-up for cheap hotel rates. 

- Believe it or not, a lot of people still have no clue about hostels…an important detail to note is that not all hostels are 20 to a room, loud, stinky dens of iniquity…some are (and that’s great if a good party and cheap bunk is what you’re after) but others aren’t. You can find super nice hostels that are more like boutique hotels with shared rooms than wild booze/sex dungeons for 20-somethings…and everything in between. Here are a few popular engines: http://www.hostelbookers.com/ http://www.hostelworld.com/ https://www.hostelz.com/ http://hostelzoo.com/

- Sign up for these Newsletters: https://www.travelzoo.com/top20/ & http://www.dealbase.com/#

- You’re probably a millennial. Act like it: https://www.airbnb.com/

- Caveat…I know nothing about this particular form of freeloading: https://www.couchsurfing.com/

- [Vacation rentals can be a killer deal if you’re traveling with a 
group:](http://vrbo.com/) Along the same lines, Google <vacation rentals in *town name*> to find local websites with apartment/house listings. 

- Ever considered camping? In particular there are a lot of nice campsites in Europe just outside major tourist centers. Even in Latin America it's often cheaper to camp than to stay in a hostel.

- Sometimes not booking ahead pays off. Often the cheapest lodging (especially in southeast Asia) can be found on the ground once you arrive.

- Similarly, you can save another $5-10 dollars a night if you forgo air conditioning. You'd be surprised how little you miss it when you have a powerful fan right above you.

**Transport**

- [Rome 2 Rio]( http://www.rome2rio.com/) is fucking amazing.

- Take the subway and don’t be intimidated by the public bus system. Buses are for losers who can’t afford to buy a car…if they can figure it out…you can figure it out. Or walk, you lazy bastard.

- For low-budget travelers, the old “take a night bus/train to save a night’s lodging” still works wonders…bonus points if you’re a normal sized human and can actually sleep in a chair.

- Rent a bike.

- Carpooling: https://www.blablacar.com/

- Hitchhiking: http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page

**Food**

- Follow the 6-block rule: Never eat within 6 blocks of a major tourist site. 

- You’ve been buying food from the supermarket your whole life. It won’t kill you to eat a peanut butter & jelly sandwich in Berlin.

- Eat local: Take a chance and wander into neighborhood joints where you have no idea what’s going on. Make the “I’m hungry” hand-to-mouth gesture to the wait staff and they’ll figure out that you’d like to exchange money for food.

- Along the same lines…ask locals, even the staff at your hostel/hotel, where you can find good cheap eats. 

- Pack Imodium and eat street food.

- Go Full Cliché! Ooh—la—la, baguette and brie on the green. Voila! Déjeuner bon marché!

**Activities**

- Research museum pricing policies and free nights: Many major museums/sites offer free entrance once a month or once a week. If you’re willing to wait in line you can schedule your visits accordingly. Feel free to use this wait time to whinge to fellow queue mates about your crippling student loans. 

- Most cities will have a “What’s Happening” site online or a free newspaper version around town…find free festivals, free exhibits and free whatevers. 

- Into art? Skip museums and browse galleries…just shave and take a shower first…don’t make it obvious that you can’t afford a goddamn thing in there.

- Learn to explore aimlessly…some of the most interesting cultural differences can be found wandering the aisles of a hardware store.

- Don’t be afraid to skip big name sites if they don’t interest you.

**Other**

- Follow your favorite airlines, hotels & travel sites on social media for first crack at specials.

- [Research destinations with this Travel Calculator]( http://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2016/10/14/free-travel-budget-calculator-will-help-find-perfect-destination/): It could be that there’s another trip just as interesting as the one you’ve got planned for half the cost.

- Don’t stress balls over it…but if possible, find a bank card with zero to no international withdrawal fees. The Yankee Doodles use Charles Schwab. (I use the same bank I always have and just pay 5 bucks because I am old and lazy.) If you do simply pay the fee (like me), take out the max with every withdrawal to limit the damage.

- Some people like to do backbreaking farm work in exchange for lentils and man bun tying tips: http://wwoof.net/

- And here’s a pseudo-legal way to find odd jobs to offset travel costs: https://www.workaway.info/

- Slow Travel: You’ll never see it all. Don’t try to. Spend more time 
in fewer places and you’ll save a bundle…my recommendation is to blow all those savings at the pub.

- Search Google for promotional codes…you know that little box at checkout? Promo/Coupon? You’d be amazed how often you can find a code to slap in there for an additional discount.

- Don’t buy a backpack full of garbage…it’s one thing to bring home a super cool keepsake or two but 90% of the shit I used to buy in the name of *souvenir!* is now collecting dust on a family member’s curio shelf.

- Skype is a dirt cheap way to stay in touch and is easier than typing out messages on your phone or finding a computer. You can call any phone in the world so cheaply it's practically free.

- A big part of saving money is to avoid losing money to scammers -- check out travelscams.org

- Got an early flight and don't want to pay for a taxi when public transport isn't running? Arrive the night before and sleep in the airport...some airports are better than others but here's a site that tells you which are the best/worst for camping out: http://www.sleepinginairports.net

**Stuff Not to Do**

- Don’t buy one of those stupid Lifestraws as if you’re living in a post-apocalyptic video game – just by bottled water like the rest of us…most places sell 5 liter jugs so the true penny pinchers can top up in the hostel.

- I personally refuse to support Hidden Ticket Travel but [here are the bozos behind the madness.]( https://skiplagged.com/)

- Above I said, “Don’t be afraid to skip big name sites if they don’t interest you.” Don’t confuse this with “Skip sites that DO interest you over a few bucks.” Don’t be that guy who went to Rome and was edgy enough to only see the Coliseum from the outside.

- Don’t be a fucking mooch. Don’t be “that guy” who fills his backpack with the free hostel breakfast, ensuring hostel goers with a hangover are left to starve because all the toast is in some hippie’s Jansport. Similarly, don’t whine and cry and bitch and moan and wail on to your new travel buds about how “poor” you are so they’ll buy you drinks or what have you…You’re not poor. Poor people don’t go on vacation. I repeat. Poor people don’t vagabond across the globe in search of Machu Picchus, foreign poontang and spiritual enlightenment. Poor people don’t own 200 Euro backpacks with Camelbak pouches.

**Addendum**

If you’ve got tips you’d like added to the list, just send me a PM and I’ll cut & paste them in:

- Time can be just as valuable as money. With short trips, if there's only a small difference, a 4 hour flight is more cost effective than than a 12 hour bus or train ride. (Hell, I once came across two flights, one was 36 hours long, cost $600, the other was 16 hours long and cost $650. Is $50 worth 20 less hours, probably.) Europe is lucky to have all of those budget airlines, but while they can be sweet, they will nickel and dime you for everything. They'd charge you for air if they could.

- Booking hostels directly is nearly always 10-15% cheaper than the booking sites out there, and they will price match. Also makes problems infinitely easier to fix. The one downside is you're open to foreign transaction fees, which leads into my next point, which you briefly touched on.

- If you're from the United States I highly suggest looking into a Charles Schwab checking account. Makes life easier, and safer so you don't have to pull out the max and walk around with a lot of cash. They will refund you all ATM fees and there are no transaction fees for foreign purchases. When you open one they give you a brokerage account, which you don't have to use, and there are no yearly fees on either account.

8,How One United Airlines Maintenance Guy in San Francisco Ruined Everybody's Trip to Sydney,31,2rsw0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2rsw0p/how_one_united_airlines_maintenance_guy_in_san/,59,2015-01-09 03:16:15,"Greetings, /r/travel - 

I'm still processing what ended up being one of the worst nights of my life on what should have been the trip of a lifetime.  A single United Airlines maintenance guy managed to ruin **everybody's** night, cost me $1100 and I never even saw what the guy looked like.  Hopefully, one or two things will happen as a result of this post - Someone might help me understand how to make this right with United ... I seem to be at a loss since our flight was 'cancelled' not 'bumped.'  Second thing, hopefully this helps you understand what happens when you fly United and what you can expect if the unexpected happens.  Here goes ...

***Here's What Happened***

We boarded our flight at SFO (UA863, if you want to know) and prepared for a 15-hr nonstop flight to Sydney.  It left at 10:30PM and when we boarded and went to the back row, we discovered that our seats were still in pieces at the back of the plane due to some 'maintenance issue.'  We got them back together, settled in and waited for takeoff.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.

They kept updating us every 15 minutes that a 'maintenance issue' was delaying us but they expected to leave shortly.  I took a nap and kept my 8-year-old occupied.  They took pity on us, passed out water and let us use the lavs.  I kept telling myself that the matter would soon be resolved and we'd be on our way.

I was wrong.

After three hours - it was 1:30 at this point.   They cancelled our flight.  The 270 people on the flight, all sleepy and pissed off, filed off the plane and we started making other arrangements.  Given that the flight was on 12/19, I knew it was going to be tough to find alternate arrangements since everyone seems to go down to Sydney at that time of year.  Called the 800 number, made arrangements to get booked on another flight, only to learn that the next available flight leaves Los Angeles two days later.  That created boondoggle #1, in which we discover that Expedia's non-refundable rooms really mean non-refundable.  Now we're out over $500 for the two days we won't be there.

So we stand in line anyway for another 2 hours to see if we can get a better option - it's 3:30 by the time I finally talk to a gate agent and find out, no, no other planes are leaving ... including the one that we just left.

And we didn't leave for a really stupid reason: 

Turns out - the only thing keeping us leaving that night was the latch on the crew sleeping quarters door of the 777.  I guess it wouldn't lock right and the maintenance guy spent 3 hours farting around with it instead of replacing the door, as he announced he finally would, just in time for the captain to say ""we're not allowed to fly after that amount of time so sorry, this flight is cancelled.""

I don't know about you but I've work in maintenance operations for a living and I know that you're allowed to escalate issues to replace non-working hardware when you can't find the simple answer in a short amount of time.  Had the maintenance guy been competent, he would have spent 30 minutes troubleshooting the door, replaced it in another 60 and this thread would never have happened.

***And Then ...***

We go downstairs to get our bags back.  Turns out, someone at United decides that everyone getting a bag back needs to file a 'lost bag claim,' creating another 2 or 3 hour-long line for us to stand in.  After about half an hour, we decide ""we'll check our bags when we return for our rescheduled flight"" and go home.  I'm glad we did - some people stayed there until 10 the following morning waiting for the one guy working baggage at 3am to get their bags.  Some of them never did.

It's now 4am.  Never having used Uber before, I approach a cab driver for a lift home.  He tels me that it'll cost me $150 to get home and United has already told me that I'll be compensated for my cab trip.  Fine, whatever, let's just go home.  We pile in and he drives us 45 minutes to get back home.  It's pissing down rain and it takes him (no joke) 30 minutes to figure out how to do a manual credit card receipt transaction since his reader isn't working and he won't take a check.  I have this guy yelling in Persian at someone on the phone in my drive way at 5am on a Saturday for half an hour - surprised my neighbors didn't call the cops.

***And Then ...***

We show up early to SFO 2 days later - I carefully check with United and Delta to make sure our bags were found and ready to go down to Sydney since my wife has time-sensitive medication and she only packed so much in her carry-on.  After several trips back and forth, they assure us that yes, the bags are checked ... we should be good to go.  We jump on the Delta flight, change at LAX and then down to Sydney.

When we arrive - sure enough - there's problems.  The bag with the medicine arrived (thank God) but one of our bags, the one with all of our fancy-dress event clothing is not there.  We file a 'lost bag' claim in Sydney, go out and wait for our clothes.

Next day?  No bag

Getting desperate, we go to the CBD and buy some last-minute clothing for our event.  Between the clothes, shoes and toiletries we were missing, another $400 down the drain.  Our bag eventually shows, but too late to do anything other than say ""yeah, that's nice.""  We put the whole thing out of our mind, even though I do file a claim with United for all of the money we lost as a result of the unlatched crew sleeping quarters door.

And Now
I just got an email today from United.  They offered a '$125 voucher' as a gesture of goodwill.  I declined and requested compensation similar to what they'd offer someone who has been involuntarily bumped from a flight.  They declined, saying ""  Please understand that our industry is vulnerable to a number of challenges that can, and do, affect our operation on a daily basis. For us to absorb our passengers’ incurred expenses or offer cash for compensation would not be a long-term business proposition we would ever be able to maintain.""

This is from the company that paid their CEO $8 Million last year and the last CEO $17 Million when he exited as part of the United / Continental merger.  I don't think asking for $1100 to compensate us is unreasonable, they pay as much as $1300 per bumped passenger.

**What We Lost**
I did the math:

* $130 for the cab ride home at 4am
* $526.78 in lost hotel room fees
* $45 for the Uber Ride Back (Never using SF Cabs again)
* $435.73 to replace the clothes we had to buy because our bag was lost in Los Angeles

All told - we spent $1137.51 because a United Maintenance Guy couldn't figure out how to get a crew sleeping quarters door latch to close in less than 3 hours.  United's offer of a $125 voucher' as a 'goodwill' gesture doesn't even cover the cab ride home, to say nothing of everything else we lost.

I'm happy to say that Reddit helped us enjoy our stay otherwise - the folks over at /r/sydney were top-notch as far as their recommendations go and we managed to have a great time down under ...

That is, as long as we didn't talk about United.

Suggestions?

***TL;DR - Flew on United, they cancelled our flight for a dumb reason and now we're out $1137.51***

EDIT - To clarify, I realize that many people feel that this is 'just one of those things' that United should not be held accountable for.  Let me add some information that I feel should be helpful:

* United had this 777 at the gate for several hours before boarding, I know because we were there to look at it.  Any maintenance issues with the plane had many, many hours to be handled before takeoff.  Whatever happened in terms of maintenance at 10:30 in the evening didn't have to wait for that point in time to be handled (i.e. - if my seat could be torn apart and put back together at 10:30, there's no reason it couldn't have been put back together at 3:30).  United didn't put a priority on having this plane passenger-ready for an on-time departure.

* The issue that caused our flight to be cancelled was something that could have been handled in a shorter amount of time had United focused on getting us in the air on time as planned.  Instead, the maintenance guy troubleshot the door for 3 hours before announcing that the door needed to be replaced, an activity taking, according to them '60 minutes', putting them over the amount of time they were allowed to fly.  Had United put a priority on getting passengers into the air, the maintenance crew should have been free to say ""You know, this is taking too long - let's replace the door and get these people out of here.""  I don't know the circumstances behind their decision to troubleshoot instead of replace, but when you're doing maintenance for a living and people's dollars are being lost for every minute you're troubleshooting, you're allowed to say ""do what you have to do, get these people back online.""

Are all of these things minor issues?  Yeah, sure ... but when minor issues are allowed to get in the way of the trip you've been planning for seven years, when those issues create a cascade effect of other problems that you were not budgeting for then yes, you're understandably disappointed.  You also expect the company whose decisions created the circumstance to make it right.  

Thanks for reading.

10,Advice on unintentional skiplag/hidden-city itinerary,5,5jas0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5jas0e/advice_on_unintentional_skiplaghiddencity/,48,2016-12-20 05:43:36,"Hi /r/travel. So I recently booked a Scott's Cheap flights deal to Copenhagen from Seattle with my girlfriend and a friend.  Originally the plan was to go into Copenhagen, and find some cheap Ryanair flights or trains to go to Germany and Stockholm.  As we were planning, we realized the connection for our inbound flight was in Frankfurt.  My girlfriend suggested we just get off and start our trip there.  We booked our entire itinerary including hotels in Germany, a one-way out of Berlin and trains between CPH/Stockholm.  

Just today, I have learned about the concept of skiplagging/hidden-city ticketing (not sure which term is most relevant).  I guess we accidentally booked a trip using this concept without realizing it was an issue and that airlines may cancel the return leg of our journey.  The thing is, we didn't do this to purposefully dodge costs to Frankfurt.  For all I know, the price to Frankfurt might have been similar.  We literally just had an idea on how to more conveniently book our trek and went with it.  

So my question is, what can I do now? I have a ton of non-refundable accommodations already booked.  Do I have any options?  Can we check-in for our flight and turn around or will the ticketing agent stop us?  Can we call the airline and explain our misunderstanding?  Does it help that the flights are on different airlines?  Our inbound is Lufthansa and outbound is SAS/United.  Not sure what options I have that don't involve purchasing another ticket.

11,$2k United Airlines Voucher - Where should I go?,14,6p90wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6p90wy/2k_united_airlines_voucher_where_should_i_go/,45,2017-07-24 19:16:57,"I recently acquired a $2,000 travel voucher from United Airlines for volunteering to get bumped (EWR>FLL, fyi) and I'm looking for ways to spend the voucher on a holiday trip. I am willing to spend *more* than the voucher price, as well. I appreciate any help or thoughts you may have.

Rules/Considerations/Research:

* I am looking to travel December 16 - 31 of 2017. I believe I need to land before midnight of the new year, PST. I want the trip to register to my United account before the end of the year to help me achieve Platinum status if possible. As a result, I'm especially interested in routes that maximize my PQD/PQM and to a lesser extent, PQS.

* I can only book flights through United.com. Depending on route, I can book other Star Alliance carriers via the United website.

* I will depart from the San Francisco Bay Area, any of the three airports is fine: SJC, SFO, OAK.

* I would like to go somewhere tropical/warm if possible but it really doesn't have to be. Just...not cold.

* BONUS: If I can stay in a Marriott property, all the better. Starwood property is great, too. Others, sure. Not a requirement though.

* Right now I am considering Mauritius, Seychelles, Maldives, Dar es Salaam, Malta, Sicily, Johannesburg, Burma, Auckland, and Sydney. I have tried and failed to find a Europe itinerary that drains the voucher and allows me to book on United. This is by no means an exhaustive list.

* I like going places where I can do things--I don't just want to park myself on the beach though I do enjoy some rest days. One thing I like about Mauritius is I feel better about patronizing a place that doesn't have (relatively) reprehensible societal and governmental norms.

* I'm interested in India but don't know where to start and am a little nervous about India for some reason. If you have great recs, I'd love that.

* There are a lot of closer, nearby, or more accessible places but I like the idea of using this free money to go somewhere I usually wouldn't spend my own money on. The kind of place I'm not likely to be able to go in the future easily. A flight to London or Singapore is easy and cheap(ish). I want to push myself a bit.

* I'm a vegetarian--need to be able to go somewhere where I can procure meals that are meatless.

Thanks!"
12,Booked 2 tickets on United for the same name by accident. United no help so far - any advice?,0,5zs0mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5zs0mr/booked_2_tickets_on_united_for_the_same_name_by/,46,2017-03-16 21:36:06,"Writing this for my dad as he doesn't have any social media accounts:

I am booked on United flight Shanghai to LAX in business class. This is a full fare business class ticket paid for my employer. My wife is accompanying me on the trip so on January 2, 2017, I bought a business class ticket for her directly from United on its website for the same flight. My wife’s ticket cost me $1940. A few days ago, I was preparing for my trip and I checked my wife’s reservation. To my surprise (horror?) I discovered that I had listed my name as the traveler instead of my wife. (By the way, this is a very easy mistake to make since when you are signed on to United’s website and you book a ticket, when you enter the traveler’s name a pull-down menu appears and my name is listed above my wife’s name.)  I didn’t think it was a big deal to change it since obviously I would not have paid for two business class seats on the same flight. Boy was I in for a surprise. 
I called United this past Sunday and explained the obvious mistake and asked that the second reservation be changed to correctly list my wife’s name.  I was told in no uncertain terms by the reservation agent that it was too bad. I would have to buy a new ticket – which now cost $3,000 -- and could pay a cancellation fee and use the value of my current ticket on a future flight.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and spoke to someone in the United Chicago office. She was of absolutely no help and just repeated what the first United rep had said. She also said that I had received an email when I booked my wife’s ticket and it was my responsibility to make sure that everything was correct in the booking. I explained that I have made at least 15 flight bookings with United in the last six months, and that I also get promotional emails from United at least once a week so it would not be surprising that I would miss this email. I also told her that I was a very good customer of United and that I HAVE 1,370,000 LIFETIME FLIGHT MILES ON UNITED AIRLINES – which should at least count for something in correcting an obvious mistake.  Nope – makes no difference whatsoever. I asked to speak to her supervisor and was told that it was not possible. So now I am stuck with a ticket that I very likely will not be able to use, and I have to buy a new ticket for my wife.


Has customer service at United fallen so low that the airline has to profit from the mistake of one of its loyal customers?  I told her that I have four business class flights currently booked and paid for with United, and after those flights I would try hard never to fly United again. 

TLDR: Accidentally booked 2 business class tickets on united under my name.  United is refusing to change one of the tickets to my wife's name and the net result will cost me at least 1k to resolve.

13,Visa tips and requirements,132,3s3gnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3s3gnl/visa_tips_and_requirements/,45,2015-11-09 07:44:49,"The rules for visas can be confusing, so I thought I'd put together some info on applying for them.  Some of this info will be a little US-centric, but the general process will be the same regardless of which passport you have.  

A visa is basically permission to enter a country.  You **always** need a visa when visiting another country, but some countries have set up a (reciprocal) 'visa-waiver' where you don't need to apply for one if you meet the visa waiver requirements.  These requirements will depend on which passport you have.  For example, US citizens (and Australia/Canada/etc) can visit certain European (Schengen) countries for combined 90 days out of 180 days without a visa.  However, if you want to stay more than 90 days in the Schengen zone, you **will** need a visa.  Thailand is another example, where US citizens don't need a visa if staying less than 30 days (arriving by air) or 15 days if arriving via land.  Most Western Europe/Canada/USA/Australia passports are lucky as many European/North American countries do not require visas for short visits.  Failing to check visa requirements beforehand can be a very expensive problem! Airlines will refuse to let you board unless you have the correct documentation.  One other important thing to check is how much time is left before your passport expires, many countries require your passport to be valid for 6 months (even if your stay is shorter).

A good place to start checking visa requirement is the Wikipedia page.  Search for 'Visa requirements for X citizens' where X is your passport.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Australian_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_British_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Canadian_citizens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens

etc.

Or check the 'visa policy of X' for the country you are planning to visit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Thailand

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Vietnam

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_India

etc.

Really the best way to check if you need a visa is using the TIMATIC database, this is what the airlines will use.

**Visas at an embassy/consulate:**  If you require a visa, usually you must apply for a visa at a country's consulate or embassy.   The actual visa is a stamp or whole-page sticker in your passport.  Visa requirements unfortunately can vary per embassy, but the basic things you will need are a filled out application, visa fee, and your passport.  There are usually three ways to go about applying.  First, you can go to the embassy/consulate yourself.  This is obviously inconvenient if you don't live in a city with a consulate.  This also involves some amount of waiting time, so you will need at least a free day.  Another way of applying is using a visa service.  You send them your application, passport and visa fee.  The visa service also will charge their own service fee on top of that.  The final way to apply is to send the application directly to the embassy/consulate via USPS/FedEx, with a pre-paid return envelope.  However, some embassies (eg. China in the US) no longer accept mailed-in applications and you must use a service or apply in person.  Best to check the application requirements on their website.

However you apply, the visa can take several days or weeks to issue, so be sure to give yourself plenty of time.  If using a visa service, add an extra couple of days.  Some places offer same-day or next-day processing for an extra fee.  I always use some sort of tracking (FedEx, US Priority Express) so that I can keep track of where my passport is and when it is on it's way back.  I actually applied for a visa last week and I saw my return tracking go live yesterday, I'll have my passport back tomorrow.

Payment for visas is usually via cashier's check/money order, at least in the US.  In some other countries, if applying in person you must go to the embassy, get a form then go to a bank and pay, get a receipt, then return to the embassy with that receipt.  Pretty inefficient unfortunately.  This is what I had to do when applying for my Iranian visa in Istanbul.

Checklist for applying for visa (* are sometimes requirements):

* Passport
* Filled out application (usually x2)
* Passport photos (usually x2)
* Visa fee
* Copy of flight itinerary
* Prepaid return envelope (if applying via mail/visa service)
* Copy of Hotel reservations(*)
* Cover letter(*)
* Copy of Bank statement(*)
* Copy of Yellow-fever vaccination(*): required for some African countries
* Letter of introduction from travel agent(*) : required for Russia, some African and Central-Asian countries

The visa application can usually be downloaded from the embassy website.  VisaHQ is another good (US) resource for finding applications and requirements (generally http://<countryname>.visahq.com)

For the copy of the flight itinerary, I will use something like TripIt and generate an itinerary without actually buying the tickets.  Not completely kosher, but I like to pad my planned visit dates by a day or two on either end just in case plans change (I still put in the same flight numbers I plan to use) or the visa gets denied for some reason (luckily Iran's so far the only one I've had denied).  I ended up needing this padding when visiting the Congos a few years ago... my flight to Kinshasa (DR Congo) was diverted to Brazzaville (Rep Congo).  If my Rep Congo visa wasn't valid yet I wouldn't have been able to get off the plane.

The cover letter is usually optional but I'll usually write one. Basically it just lays out what kind of visa I would like, and my planned itinerary and perhaps something nice to say about the country I am visiting.  

**Visas on arrival:** Some countries can issue a visa when you arrive at the airport or at a border.  These on-arrival visas may have different stay requirements or fees than one obtained in an embassy.  Some visa on arrival require pre-authorization before travel.  This can be arranged usually though a travel agent, hotel, or website.  The pre-authorization can take a few days.  You will receive a confirmation email that you show at airport checkin and on arrival to receive your visa.  There will usually be a window labeled 'VISA' before immigration where you will get your visa sticker.  

**e-visas: ** These are the latest type of visas, which require applying and paying online ahead of your visit.  Similarly to pre-arranged VOA, you will get a printout/verification that you show at immigration on arrival.  This verification can take a few hours or days to receive.  E-visas may also have different requirements/limitations than a visa issued at an embassy.

**Passport photos:** Most paper visa applications require one or two passport photos.  It's actually quite easy and cheap to make your own.  You will need a tripod or someone to take a photo of you against a white background.  An easy way to do this is to drape a sheet over a door.  Don't worry about getting the photo perfectly centered.  Just make sure to have a neutral face, nothing covering your face, etc.  Then use an online photo-sizing tool to center the face.  2""x2"" are usually fine when applying for visas.  You can then use GIMP/Photoshop/etc to create a tiled 4""x6"" image (6 photos).  Some online sites can do this as well.  You can then upload & print this at Walgreens/CVS/Walmart/etc for $0.30 or so.  I'll usually get 3-4 printed at a time as I apply for a lot of visas! If you use European/UK visa photo (35mm x 45mm) tiling you can get 8 per page.

Here are some countries that require some sort of visa:

* USA: Requires pre-approval (ETSA) if from a visa-waiver country.  (https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/)
* Australia: requires pre-authorized ETA (US) or eVisitor Visa (UK)  (https://www.border.gov.au/Trav)
* India: e-visa (https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/info1.jsp)
* Turkey: e-visa (http://www.evisa.gov.tr)
* Iran: Complicated.  Some countries get visa-on-arrival (Aussies).  Brits/Canadians/US need a visa beforehand. 
* Egypt: Visa on arrival, easy
* Bahrain: e-visa (https://www.evisa.gov.bh/) or visa on arrival.
* Jordan: Visa on arrival (at airport), easy. Visa required beforehand if crossing overland at Allenby bridge.
* Brazil: US citizens need a visa, Europeans don't
* Argentina: US citizens must pay reciprocity fee before travel ($160) - https://reciprocidad.provincianet.com.ar/ but good for life of passport
* China: Visa required beforehand.  Some countries can get 72-hr visa-free transit (eg. flying USA -> Beijing -> Thailand you could stay 72 hrs in Beijing).
* Vietnam: Visa-free (Brits, some Europeans) for 15-day stays.  For longer stays, or US citizens, pre-authorized visa on arrival available at airports only.  Otherwise visa required beforehand if arriving via land.
  Pre-authorized visas can be arranged through http://www.myvietnamvisa.com , http://www.vietnamvisa.org, etc.  There are lots out there, just pick the cheapest.  Takes 2-3 days to get the visa authorization.

* Thailand: Visa-free for 30-days if arriving by air. 15 if arriving via land.
* Laos: Visa on arrival
* Russia: Visa required beforehand.  It may be possible to visit St. Petersburg and some other cities for 72-hrs without a visa if you are on a cruise/tour.
* Sri Lanka: e-visa (http://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/center.jsp?locale=en_US)

I don't travel on these American airlines ordinarily. Is there something I should know? Are all three airlines roughly the same?

We'll be traveling to Europe next summer. I found round trip flights for just over $1,000 each on Norwegian. I also found flights on United for about $100 more than the Norwegian flights for my boyfriend and I, but over $500 more for my dad (he will be coming back at a different date and from a different city than my boyfriend and I).

I was just wondering how much different Norwegian is, since it is a budget airline.

I looked up seat configurations and the seat pitch is the same, and Norwegian's seat width is 1.3 inches or less than United. Is this a big difference? It doesn't sound like it to me, but who knows.

Is there any reason I should pick United over Norwegian? I don't care about not getting a meal."
20,How to get escorted off a plane with United without doing anything wrong at all - it's a long story.,39,xqjhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xqjhh/how_to_get_escorted_off_a_plane_with_united/,36,2012-08-06 03:56:14,"All you need to know about me is this: I live in Upstate New York, I had a summer internship in Michigan, and I have family in Southern California.

Back in April I bought a round trip flight with United Airlines for my internship. The return flight to Syracuse (Grand Rapids-Cleveland-Syracuse) was scheduled for August 4. Then partway through the summer I decided to go to California with my family and bought a ticket for the same day, but
 it was cheaper to buy a new roundtrip flight through American Airlines than it was to change the United flight so I bought the California one (Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County) for later in the afternoon on August 4. I figured I'd meet up with my mom, say hi and give her some stuff I didn't need and then fly on to California.

So in the morning on Saturday August 4 I set out for Grand Rapids, checked in with United - they gave me both my ticket for Cleveland and for Syracuse, all ready to go - and in texting my parents I got this weird text from my mom - u r flying rite 2 cali. I had NO idea what she was talking about so I called her and she said, “Your Cleveland-Syracuse flight got canceled, United called the house yesterday and said they were going to call you.” I have no idea how they got my home phone number, and that hasn't been useful to me in over a year because I’ve been studying abroad and not home at all, but they never called me, never emailed me, nothing. So then my dad is calling them again while I'm trying to find someone in the godforsaken Grand Rapids airport - there is ONE person working there for United and he says he can't help me right now because he is boarding the Cleveland flight and I said no, you need to help me right now because I either need to get on this flight or not. And he won't help me so I leave and go back to the check-in desk outside of the secure area to get them to fix it.

I explain to the guy at the ticket desk what's going on, and he brings out a lady who must be higher up than him because obviously it's all too complex for him to understand. She says our contract with you is to get you to Syracuse not California. I say yes, but your contract was also to get me there at a specific time and you cancelled the flight that would get me there on time so I could make my next flight and get to Orange County. She says well we'll have American Airlines fix this for you and prints me an itinerary for American that says now Grand Rapids-Chicago-Syracuse and then I can get on my American Airlines flight - Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County. I say fine - they basically passed me off so that I can't yell at them and get anything else out of them - and go to the American desk. The man there is really nice and fixes it so I just go Grand Rapids-Chicago-Orange County. So I fly to Chicago and it's all sorted out.

My brother, sister, cousin and grandmother are also in Chicago, flying with United of all things, leaving a good 6 hours earlier than me, and I know that United owes me compensation for the canceled flight so I figure I'll try and get on that flight, I might as well try and save my grandmother a trip to the airport late at night. So I go to the customer service desk for United and there's a huge line and so I call customer service while I'm in the line. The woman I spoke with gets me exactly what I want, says my itinerary is now changed for Orange County and I just need to print my boarding pass for this flight at 3pm local time. I thank her and thank her saying she's the first person with United who's been any help to me all day. So I have the lady at the desk print it for me and I'm all set to go. I get on the plane, no issue, sitting a good 20 or so rows ahead of my family and right as we're about to take off a security woman comes down the aisle, addresses me by name and says, “You need to come with me. You have not paid for this flight and you need to be going to Syracuse. You cannot go to another state Orange County is in another state.”

And I said I know exactly where Orange County is and where Syracuse is but I've already sorted this out and I have my boarding pass, it's right here, United printed it out for me just 20 minutes ago. And she said no look and she points to four letters at the top of the ticket - PTKT - and says that makes it not valid and it means you haven't paid for this flight. I ask if anyone else was scheduled to be in this seat and she said no but you still can't sit there we can't take you to Orange County for free. I say you aren't taking me for free I paid you $420 for my flight months in advance. She says I need to go now and I figure I could get myself in much hotter water than I am already so I get my stuff and go.

So my family still hasn't noticed what's going on because they're so far back and I yell to my sister as I'm standing in the aisle getting my bag, ""HEY, I'll make it to California. ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT EVERYONE."" As I exit the plane I say to one of the stewardesses, “Would you mind at least explaining to my family why you've taken me off the plane? And then I'm standing in the jetway expecting to talk my way back onto the plane. The woman says I need to go to Syracuse. I said, “If you had actually done your homework you'd see that your company cancelled my flight from CLEVELAND, not Chicago, to Syracuse over 24 hours ago, and this is how the woman on the phone fixed it for me, because you ruined my travel plans and made it impossible for me to get from Syracuse to Orange County on time.” She kept saying ""Syracuse and Orange County are in different states"" and I said I KNOW. Then it started to dawn on me how long I'd been on the defensive, and I was tired and frustrated, and I burst into tears.

“You humiliated me in front of a hundred people, you took me away from my family, I haven't seen them in over a year between school and travel and work and I just want to go with them to see my aunt in California.” They escort me out of the jetway and I follow a guy in a dumb looking suit to the desk in front of the gate and say how are you going to fix this? And he says I'm printing you a boarding pass for Chicago-Syracuse. This gets me into Syracuse at 9pm. I say, “Have you not been listening to me? This is absolutely useless to me. My flight from Syracuse to CHICAGO is leaving at 4 pm IN ONE HOUR.” He said, “You'll have to figure it out with American Airlines from there. I tell him that I and other customers pay United an awful lot to be treated like livestock.” I take the boarding pass but go back to the American Airlines counter and ask if the boarding pass I was given in the morning, the one for Santa Ana at 6:50 pm, is actually a boarding pass and if I'll be able to get on the plane, and they say yes your boarding pass is valid. I say thank you and find a corner with some carpet and nap for a while, read a bit, and cry now and then because I'm just stressed out and tired of being alone.

That flight is delayed about an hour but sure enough I get on the plane and it leaves the ground without anyone coming on and making a fool of me. I get into California around 10pm West Coast time - I have now been awake for almost 20 hours - and my aunt picks me up and takes me to the house where I pass out on the couch for the night. Now I’m with family and I’m glad to be, but I want justice. I want to spread this story and give United Airlines the publicity it deserves, and I hope the Internet can help me out with that.

*Maybe if I was an Olympic athlete, they would have treated me better?*

**TL;DR: I tried to get my flight changed with United Airlines after they cancelled one of my flights, they printed me a boarding pass and I got on the plane, they escorted me off saying I hadn't paid.**"

Current bucket list:

* Australia \(Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Great Barrier Reef, Whitsunday Islands, possibly Perth and Uluru/Ayers Rock\)
* New Zealand \(Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch\)
* Hike Inca Trail to Machu Picchu
* Dominican Republic \(for [this beauty](https://www.aman.com/resorts/amanera)\)

...and that's it. Those four would be some pretty great trips, but I'm looking for inspiration for where else I should travel. I've heard great things about Croatia, anyone here recommend it? I would also love to explore South America \(never been, and apart from Machu Picchu, I'm interested in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina\).

What do I like? I'm an adrenaline junkie, so roller coasters, ziplines, and anything thrilling is great. I love nature and adventure, so hikes are also amazing, especially those with a view. That being said, I feel the most at home in cities  as there is so much to do. Often my travel consists of some really relaxing do\-nothing days and some jam\-packed exploring days \(usually in cities\).

For flights, I try to stick with Star Alliance member airlines \(all while trying my best to avoid United\), but I've had great experiences with KLM, BA, Emirates, and Cathay Pacific, so those are all options. I'm based in Toronto, Ontario but will soon be moving to the Bay Area, so YYZ is my home airport, but that will soon change to SFO. In terms of accommodation, I don't couchsurf and could count on one hand the number of times I've used an AirBnB. I prefer SPG hotels \(brand loyalty is rewarding\) but would love to further experience different Aman properties \(so if anyone has been to any Aman Resorts, I'd love to hear about it\).

In case it helps, some of my favourite places I've been are Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, French Polynesia, the UK, Kenya, Tanzania, and the US. The only place I didn't really enjoy was Vietnam, but it's likely that's because I had just been in Thailand and preferred that by a long shot. The only countries I want to avoid are those on the Government of Canada's travel advisory list as ""Avoid all travel"", which are the usual culprits \(Syria, Yemen, Burundi, Somalia, Central African Republic, Afghanistan, Iraq, DPRK, Libya, Mali, South Sudan, Chad, and Niger\)

In terms of languages, I'm fluent in English and French, and can read/write but not speak very well in Spanish and Swedish.

So, what do you suggest I add to my bucket list?"
22,Scheduling flights to and from Italy (via Chicago) in June 2018: is this the cheapest way?,6,7j2hhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7j2hhe/scheduling_flights_to_and_from_italy_via_chicago/,31,2017-12-11 17:25:49,"My husband and I are going to Italy in mid-June 2018 for two weeks. We would be flying into Rome, and out of Milan (via Chicago). In my comparisons, I have found it's cheaper to fly into somewhere like London, then to book a separate flight into Italy (these flights are averaging around $100). 

Note that for the long-haul flight, I'm sticking with airlines like United, British, American, as opposed to budget. Once we're in Europe, it's whatever is cheapest.

Does anyone have any experiences (good or bad) booking a bunch of separate flights? Am I any more or less likely to run into coordination issues? As I've been choosing flights, I've been giving us several hours between to account for delays.

Any thoughts would be helpful.

Thank you!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your responses and advice. I've tried several combinations of round-trips, one ways, multi-city, whatever and this is the cheapest I've found with a good schedule.

*prices are the total for 2 adults. The Chicago to London, and London to Chicago is purchased as a RT ticket.

1) 11-Jun: Chicago-ORD > London-LHR; 3:50PM -- 5:55AM (06/12); 8h , non stop, United

A few Skype interviews later and she got it!  So we immediately started scrambling for a new flight for her to get back in time (flying into LAX instead of SFO).  After finding several fares online for $0 fare difference and $300 change fee, I tried to book one, but the website would not cooperate.  So we went the phone route, and the representative couldn’t find a $0 fare difference, but found one for $200-ish.  I, being cheap, said we would call back, as the tease of the numerous $0 flights taunted me from my computer.  I kept trying the internet, to no avail.  Back onto a Skype phone call with United, where the representative found a flight that had $0 fare difference and $300 change fee.  HUZZAH!  I felt vindicated and proud that my cheapness paid off (who wouldn’t want an extra $500 in their bank account, especially when you’re hemorrhaging money overseas??).  So we booked it through the agent, enjoyed the wedding, and flew home separately.

Part 2:  We get home and notice that there is a $993 charge on our Chase card (United Mileage Plus) in addition to the $300 charge for the change fee.  I ring up United and they say that this is the fare difference.  I tell them that there was no fare difference when we spoke to the representative and that we would be contesting the charge with Chase.  Chase then got back to us and told us that United had confirmed that it was a valid charge so that didn’t work - their in bed together, big suprise.  I then called United back telling them again about the situation and how we were being swindled and they told me to submit a Customer Service Refund Request, so I did.  They quickly got back to me saying “Unfortunately, we are unable to honor your request and would like to explain why. Our records show the ticket was used; therefore, no refund is due.”  Grrrrr.  

So here we are.  Out of an extra thousand dollars and nowhere to turn.  I'm searching for another plan of attack to get back what is rightfully ours.  My only hope is that United has some sort of recording of the conversation I had with them so I can prove that the representative said we had a $0 change fee.

Help me Reddit Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope…

TL;DR - United promised me a $0 fare difference, then charged me $993."

I ended up going with a mix of Jet Blue, Delta (I splurged for the premium seat on the long haul) and Air France. I may regret my decision once I'm at the airport, but for now my desire to change things up has won out. It's not my last trip, so I can always learn my lesson and go back to my predictable LH flight next time. 



I am taking a trip from Houston to Naples, Italy in December... again.  
This will be my 7th time in 18 months. Typically I've flown with Lufthansa with a few other airlines mixed in occasionally (United/Canada/Brussels) Unfortunately military pay (hubby is stationed over there) doesn't allow for frequent international travel in anything nicer than economy. If you can imagine I'm feeling a bit worn with the monotonous 8-10 hour knee stiffening flights, and I'm feeling a bit tired of LH just in general.

* What I'm asking is, from your experience, for the long haul flights, (I couldn't really care less about the shorter ones) is Lufthansa economy, or United economy PLUS better? I've never taken United on a long haul so that one's new to me. I do know if it was between econo, and econo, I'd stick with Lufthansa, but is the infamous American airline worth the sacrifice for the leg room on a 9ish hour flight?

I do know that Lufthansa is implementing a new premium economy, but I can only seem to get it for the outgoing itinerary. The return will only let me book business, which unfortunately is not financially an option.

We did not use ff-miles for the tickets, but got a great deal, so had to act fast.

Now our options are cancel/rebook with her (not together) on a different flight for a ton more money/ff-miles (which is ludicrous), and that's really about it.

Marriage license / birth certificate, etc. are all not options as the airline said they wouldn't matter.

I should probably mention the trip isn't for a few months, so there's time to act on things however we can.

I've exhausted other ideas for help (Google, other subreddits, etc.).

Note: Airline is United, if that matters, and uses Air NZ for flight out and back to States.  Air NZ can't change anything because the ticket is booked through United, and United won't change name on ticket because they claim they ""don't do that"" for international flights.

The vouchers must be used by August this year, and we will be flying out of LAX. We basically have all of **July** free and would be happy to spend the full month away - and it doesn't have to be limited to USA, just the $1000 for two tickets.

**We don't have any budget for traveling** this summer, but really want to use up our vouchers. We enjoy camping and hiking and have a lot of equipment already, so that is one possible option. Alternatively, I'd love to find something that is like an exchange, ie. I can offer **3 or 4 weeks** of manual labor in return for food and board.

Anyway, please let me know if you have any ideas or know of any opportunities that might be a good fit.

Some context: I live in Asia and had a flight scheduled to go back to the US for a weekend where I was standing up in my best friend's wedding. There were two actually -- an Air Japan flight to Tokyo and another to the U.S. -- but both booked directly through United's website. However, when I arrived to the airport, each airline's check-in counter kept sending me to the other, claiming that I had to check-in with the opposite airline. They looked at my email confirmation, receipts, passport, made phone calls and yet still, nobody could figure out which airline I was supposed to check-in with. This back-and-forth ate up so much time that eventually the gate closed, the plane took off, and I still didn't have a boarding pass from either airline. I think it goes without saying that this was a fucking mortifying experience -- being a best man, my presence at this wedding was non-negotiable, and United didn't have any other flights that would allow me to make it on time, so I had to book with a third airline on the spot for 2x the cost. 

Fast forward to now, I submit a refund request for the cost of the ticket and United tells me a fee of $138 will be applied because I booked a nonrefundable ticket. I know that it wasn't technically an ""emergency"" situation (i.e. death or jury duty), but still feel like it's a special circumstance and was due to the incompetence of both airlines. It's not like I cancelled because my plans changed or I just didn't feel like taking the flight anymore. 

Any advice on how I could get this fee waived? I've tried calling twice so far, but no luck.

I have picked up several tricks that help to make the 6-12 hour journey more relaxing. Feel free to add your own ideas as well. This is just a list of my own experiences.

**Before you get to the airport**

* **Shower**
Before you even leave home, take a shower, no one likes BO especially in an enclosed space. Also try and bring spare clothes and roll-on deodorant in your cabin baggage to freshen up onboard.
* **Give plenty of time to travel**-
They say the journey begins as soon as you leave home, so try to be as relaxed as possible before leaving, whether driving, taxi or catching a train to the airport. Allow an extra hour or maybe two to make sure you have plenty of time in case of traffic/delays. If possible stay at a hotel near the airport (especially with early morning UK-US flights) thus reducing your overall travel time.
* **Eat before you get to the airport**-
An early morning (UK-US) or evening (US-UK) flight leaves a long time since your last meal, the time spent in the airport and before you are served your in-flight meal will make you hungry. Eating a plentiful meal before will fill you up and stop you going hungry if your in-flight meal (jokes aside) is unappetising. Watch what you eat as well, bad smells in an enclosed space are not well received. Buying food before getting to the airport will also save money as in the next rule..
* **Buy any necessities before you go**-
Granted there are shops in the airport that sell things you need try to buy them from your local retailer. Remember security restrictions with liquids (suncream and the like).

**At the airport**

* **Use online check-in**-
This is a no brainer. Simply if your airline offers it, use it. It saves plenty of time and beat several hundred people through security.
* **Check-in early/late**-
Both methods can help you dodge the inevitable queues at the check in. But it depends on the time check-in opens).
If it is very early morning (before rush hour 8-9am) check in first. Your bags may get loaded first and offloaded last but you can get through a quieter security. You may have longer to wait, but it is better sitting in departures than stuck in a long queue. Late check in grants you first offload status at the end of your flight but best bet is to be at the airport early and just chill for a while before checking in.

**At the airport**

* **Use charging ports**-
With time to kill you will inevitably use your phone/tablet/handheld games console etc. The 2/3 hours spent on them may drain the battery and with an 8/12 hour flight ahead, the battery may run out before you arrive so charge your devices fully before leaving home then if you use them, recharge them as much as you can.
* **Use the toilet just before you board**-
You never know how long it will be before you can use the onboard toilets but best bet is go before, there will be a small rush in the air when everyone wants to go first and with unexpected turbulence you may not get the chance to go.
* **Arrive at the gate early but board late**-
Getting to the gate early stops a last minute dash before the doors close, but once boarding commences everyone rushes to get on first. If you wait as long as possible everyone else will have found their seats and sat down and not blocking the aisles. Just remember to be not too late and annoy the rest of the passengers.

**In the air**

* **Don't take off your shoes/socks**
Just don't, you may have showered before you went to the airport (please do) but them being in shoes for several hours will kick up a stink. If you have brought slippers, then that is ok.
* **Be considerate of nearby passengers**
Generally don't be an dick to the people you are going to sit with for over 6 hours. Talk quietly, don't recline back (ask first) and if you don't sit on an aisle, limit trips to the toilet/friends etc.
* **Bring snacks**
If the inflight meal seems too long away, you may be tempted to buy snacks from the galley. The same captive market rules apply, bring food from home (no smelly/allergy foods) and consume or dispose of them before you land (any foods that may be prohibited meat/fruit etc).
* **Stay healthy**-
Spending over 6 hours sat in one spot is not good for your body, try to stretch your muscles maintain blood flow to your legs (avoiding DVT) and even take small walks around the cabin. Just remember to be considerate of others.
* **Have all necessary documentation ready BEFORE you land**
Have your documents ready and easily accessible for immigration and customs saves time and stress when on the ground and stops last minute panics as you fumble for your passport in your bag.

**After landing**

* **If near to the exit, get off as quick as possible**
It will help you avoid the queue at immigration. However if you are several rows away, just be patient. No one likes to be cooped up for 9 hours but just a few more minutes won't hurt. 
* **Remember when you checked-in**
This can help you when to collect your bags, if you checked in first, your bags will most likely appear on the carousel last. It also helps stop people blocking access to the carousel and stop people from getting their bags off.

44,Experience with Etihad Airways? Or is there a better option...,1,cqquef,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/cqquef/experience_with_etihad_airways_or_is_there_a/,24,2019-08-15 18:50:04,"I was about to FINALLY book a flight to Bangkok on Cathay, after weeks of panicking and reading reviews. Now of course, I’ve been reading that I should avoid Hong Kong. I’m a superrrrr anxious person so flying/ traveling is a huge deal to me, i really push myself to travel. I know a lot of people think it’s silly to feel so worked up over a flight. But whatever is going to help me feel less anxious I will do. 
So. Please help with these other flight options- 

Etihad Airways (I’ve honestly never even heard of them but maybe I live under a rock) But the reviews seem good? Named one of the safest airlines on earth? Anyone have good / bad experiences?! 

United even though everyone hates United. It just seems comforting to me because it’s what I’m used to.

Or stick with Cathay?"
45,"Advice Needed: ""Low Stress"" First International Trip with S.O. that Still Feels ""Foreign""",2,57yw60,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/57yw60/advice_needed_low_stress_first_international_trip/,24,2016-10-17 22:19:15,"I hope this is not too vague, but I will try to give details on what I am looking for, and any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Love browsing this sub.

**Who:** I am in the process of booking a trip for my fiancee and me for early May. We are mid twenties and live in New York.

**Past Travel:** My fiancee has never been out of the US and is the main reason why I want to take an international trip. I have been to Croatia/Hungary, United Arab Emirates and Germany. I would like to try something new.

**Length/Budget:** ~ 1 Week, ~2000 dollars (Not including Airfare). I should note that I have a ton (~200k Mileage plus Miles) and am practiced in getting rewards flights so airfare costs should be minimal.

**All Inclusive vs City Travel:** Here is my number one question. I want to travel somewhere that has a ""foreign feel"", but I do not want to have the whole backpacking feel to it either. For example, I did Berlin/Budapest/Zagreb and really enjoyed that trip, but think it will be too much for my S.O.

I want a relaxing vacation such as one you find in the Caribbean at a chain ""All Inclusive"" resort, but I still want to feel like I am out of the country. I hope this makes sense. My fear is that if I go to the Carribean, I will not have that same ""foreign feel"" that I had when I was in Croatia or UAE.

I guess what I am asking of is a single stop (no multi-city), vacation which will certainly feel like I am far away from NYC, but at the same time I do not want to be in a different city every 2 days running around from hotel to hotel sticking to a very packed sightseeing itinerary.

**Interests:** I have a strong interest in history and architecture. Fiancee is has a conversational command over Spanish, and I have very basic French.

**Current Ideas:** Right now I am thinking about Greece, France (non-Paris), or a less ""commercialized"" Central American Country. I am all over the place though, I need some refinement.
Any suggestions for a low-stress* vacation that still has more of an ""international"" feel to it than something in Jamaica or Dominican Republic would have?

Please let me know if you have any questions and I appreciate any suggestions. I am open to anything, and the Airline miles really allow me many options."
46,How strict is United Airlines about checked luggage sizes?,1,41c4l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/41c4l5/how_strict_is_united_airlines_about_checked/,24,2016-01-17 07:58:42,"I will be flying internationally this week and just measured my bag - it measures 63.3 linear inches. It says on the United website that checking anything over 62 inches results in a 200 dollar fee. Called them and they said that yep, they'll charge me for that 1.5 inch.

I'm definitely within the weight limitations but I'm wondering just how strict they are about sizes. Are bags actually measured?

48,Hi /r/travel... flying United before the end of January? I'm giving away some global premier upgrades that I won't be able to use (upgrade from economy to first or business class anywhere in the world) and one domestic (US only) first class upgrade to a few lucky people! Happy Cinco de Hannukah!,20,5ktk42,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5ktk42/hi_rtravel_flying_united_before_the_end_of/,23,2016-12-29 02:59:20,"Hi all!

I traveled quite a bit for business in 2015, and that afforded me 1K status on United for all of 2016. With that status I was gifted a bunch of coupons for first/business class upgrades, both internationally and domestically. I've used most of my domestic upgrades, but haven't had the occasion to use the international ones. I don't work for united, I'm not an affiliate, not in the travel industry... just a satisfied patron of the airline that doesn't have travel plans in the near future. I'd love to use them, but it looks unlikely, and United won't let me keep 'em.

These upgrades expire at the end of January, so I figured that I'd take to the internet and see if I could bequeath these to a few deserving folks. 

If you're interested... tell me where you're going, how many upgrades you need, and why I should pick you!

**A few things to note:**

**1)** These upgrades cannot be transferred from account to account like miles can. In order for me to gift these upgrades I must ""sponsor"" you - this requires me to have your last name and confirmation number. From there, I can redeem the upgrade from *my* account to *your* reservation. So, it requires a little bit of trust from a random stranger. To be helpful here, I'm willing to talk on the phone/verify who I am before you pass along information, if that matters to you. Otherwise, you can just know me as UpgradeAngel.

**2)** These upgrades are instantaneous for some flights, and some flights only have wait list available. If you already have flight plans booked, I will be able to tell right away if this will work instantaneously. If you haven't booked your travel yet, there is no way for me to see if the upgrade cannot be redeemed instantaneously. If a flight is waitlisted, I can call United and find out the chances of the upgrade going through, based on my (your) position on the upgrade list and availability in premium cabins, which I am willing to do.

**3)** These upgrades will only work on travel that will be completed before January 31st. So, if your flight is after January 31st, I can't sponsor your itinerary.

**4)** These upgrades will not work for tickets booked with award travel.

If you have some friends that you know are traveling or that you'd like to help out, show them this thread and let's see if we can make some magic happen together!"

52,United Airlines: Comcast of the Sky,24,2nxvrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2nxvrc/united_airlines_comcast_of_the_sky/,23,2014-12-01 17:16:42,"At this point it’s no surprise that Comcast is now considered to be the worst company in America, and thanks to the good people of Reddit they’re finally catching some flack for it.  But though their knack for piss-poor customer service has grabbed the limelight as of late, there’s another company making its way up the ranks—and their nefarious antics are going largely unchecked.


**Rats With Wings**

Time and time again, people are personally reminded why United is consistently rated one of the worst carriers in the world. From lost bags to delayed flights to unannounced cancellations, they take the cake in regards to negligence.  But everything else they do wrong pales in comparison to one sole aspect: how they treat their customers.

Their [twitter feed.](https://twitter.com/united/with_replies) Their [Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/United) Their [Google search results.](https://www.google.com/search?q=united+customer+service&oq=united+customer+service&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l5.2342j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=united+customer+service+reviews) The internet is chock-full of complaints and rants about just how bad United’s customer service is. Time and time again you see customers who have been [stuck on hold for several hours](http://i.imgur.com/R3Awy0S.png) only to have their [call dropped or redirected to the very beginning](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/united-airlines-mileageplus/1554099-united-dropped-calls-cant-call-back.html).  Asking for a manager automatically places you on hold for 30 minutes or more (go ahead, try it yourself).  And more often than not your complaint is met with a “please fill out the feedback form online” which takes up to 14 business days for them to respond to, as if they’re purposely delaying their response so you have enough time to forget the details of your complaint.

Before last month, I didn’t have any reason to believe that United was as bad as everyone said it was. Then United sold me a faulty ticket and nearly stranded my family in Morocco.

 
**How United Stole $168 From a Baby**

Over the past year I’ve used United's frequent flyer program to book countless flights with their StarAlliance partners around the world—not without problems, but nothing I’ve ever found to be worth complaining about. As I've flown with my wife and my toddler-age son, we’ve always paid for adult tickets with points and paid the full price for the lap-child ticket.  There has not been a single incident with this method, and each time we used United.com or their booking phone line to book the flight and the tickets transferred to the partner airline without fail.  That’s why it was so odd to us that, when we tried to check in our child’s ticket at the front desk at the Casablanca Airport, he suddenly didn’t exist.

Even after pulling together every shred of evidence that we in fact had purchased the ticket, the ticket number United gave us and the [$55 bill in my account](http://i.imgur.com/ImiGn7D.png) was not enough for the airline to let us on the plane—quite simply, United did not issue the ticket for my son on the partner airline.  Perhaps if we didn’t have two transfers to make after this flight in order to get to our destination in Cape Town, I would have waited at the airport for United to resolve the issue “properly”.  Instead, knowing that it would possibly be over a week before the next available flight (and knowing that they would not refund us the two adult tickets if we stayed), we were more or less forced to either buy a last-minute ticket for our kid or be stuck indefinitely.  Total cost of the new ticket equaled to $112.98, and despite arriving to the airport 3 hours early we made it on the plane with just a handful of minutes to spare.

I managed to contact United via Twitter during this incident since I couldn't call them while in the midst of all this. Though they confirmed that the ticket for my son existed on their end, they took 20 minutes in between each response and ultimately decided [my complaint would be best handled by me filling out a request form for a refund on the ticket I purchased through them](http://i.imgur.com/FCRqlkw.png).  But I didn’t want a refund on the $55 ticket that was supposed to work - I wanted my money back for the last-minute ticket they forced me to purchase.

Fast forward to 3 weeks later. By this time I’ve spent nearly 10 hours on the phone, written dozens of emails, contacted them through every form of social media (which I realize gets me nowhere but I just wanted to make a stink), filed forms for both complaints/feedback and refunds, and not only have they still refused to pay for the $113 ticket, they won’t even refund me the faulty $55 ticket that was never able to be used.  Instead, after all of my efforts in garnering a proper response, they offered a $50 voucher redeemable on any United-only flight— [a “gesture of goodwill”, they tell me](http://i.imgur.com/A7EhFGp.jpg), as apparently none of this is their fault.  Hope in actually getting my money back at this point is nearly absent.


**United Wipes Their Butts With Customer Complaints**

The worst part about all this isn’t the loss of money, or the personal mistreatment and neglect I’ve encountered during this entire ordeal.  The worst part is that my story is not unique: thousands of people this year alone have been unforgivingly slighted by United Airlines, and some have lost out on much more than $168 bucks.  And it continues unchecked, as if United believes they cannot be stopped.

And maybe they’re right; after all, everything we’ve heard about Comcast recently has proven that your complaints only matter if they’ve gone viral like [Dan Furia’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2duzfi/comcasts_corporate_response_to_my_recent_reddit/)… and sometimes even that doesn’t work, such as in [Gary O’Reilly’s case](http://www.inquisitr.com/1504720/comcast-home-security-customer-service/).  Where businesses are supposed to suffer tremendous consequences for bad customer service, these mega-corporations have proven that even with literally the worst reputation in America they can turn a profit. There is no check-and-balance, and they are only getting worse.

I don’t expect to see my money back, and I will be sure to avoid United as best as I logically can in the future.  But that doesn’t solve the underlying problem: United is going to do the same thing to someone else a hundred times over and never be held accountable, and simply “not flying United” just isn’t enough to stop it."

A week or so ago, tornadoes hit near Atlanta, completely snarling airline traffic. My flight to India was the next day. Understandably, Delta had to reroute my flight through United/Lufthansa. No problem, I even got upgraded on the way to Frankfort. Unfortunately, they decided to change my return tickets without notifying me, so I wasted 3 hours last night running all over Delhi airport because nobody could find the ticket that I paid for. Finally, I was able to reach my travel agent and she helped Delta figure out their screw-up. I ended up having to be escorted through the diplomatic queue in customs so I could make my flight. (Side note: don't try to hug a Indian woman to thank her. They don't like it)
Anyway, here I sit in Heathrow, waiting for my flight back to 'Murica so I take to the twitters to voice my displeasure. Hilarity ensues:
Me- thanks for almost leaving me stranded in Delhi, guys...
@Delta- sorry for the inconvenience.
Me- yeah, well you guys really should have told me you changed my ticket.

@Delta- sorry for the inconvenience.

Yesterday our flight was delayed 3 and a half hours on united in the US. after trying to figure everything out the flight only ended up being 30 minutes late and the attendant promised us we had plenty of time to make our connection. Then.. we arrive in chicago and there's no gate for our plane... that took another 20 minutes. They also changed the plane so when we got off we had to wait another 15 minutes to get our carry on luggage that was stowed under the airplane. 

At the point I'm sure you can guess that we missed our connection to Ireland. And that airline only has one flight to Ireland a day. So here we are.. stuck in chicago for 24 hours. I saved for months to splurge on a hotel in Dublin..and lost out on that money due to having to cancel less than 24 hours in advance. 

We were planning on taking a flight from dublin to paris on the 31st to get there for New Years Eve so now the airline got us a flight out tonight to arrive in paris on the 31st... but we have a 30 minutes layover in dublin... so 30 minutes to change fucking planes, and we can't sit together on the eight hour flight. . 

Thank you, United for such a great start to my honeymoon. We no longer get to see ireland, I'm out 300 for a hotel and we'll be lucky to even make it to Paris. I will never fly with you again. "

Meaning, this trip that I'm trying to plan is uncharted territory for me. Some pointers would be really helpful!

Here are the details:

* First, I'm not 100% sure about the date yet, but I know it will fall somewhere between March and April of 2015. 
* We want to spend 3 weeks (21 days) on this
* We want to spend the most time in Italy and Spain
* We are considering the Eurail Select Pass as a means of travel (http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/select-pass)
* We would be traveling from the US (Florida) 

Some questions that we have:

* We're considering the Eurail pass, but is there a better means of transportation between cities and countries?
* I don't even know where we start in creating the budget for this. I was thinking about trying to keep it around $6,000 not including airfare (we have many thousands of airline miles that we'll probably make use of for this), but I don't know if that's a realistic number. Any pointers on this front?
*And most importantly, what are the best places to visit in these countries? What are some good restaurants, hidden away little shops, etc?

I'm the most interested in hearing your stories and opinions on the best places to visit while we're there. We're cost conscious, but it's not the highest thing on the list. Mostly, we just want to have a good time! Redditors, HALP! :)

Oh...I almost forgot. I was thinking about starting this in Lisbon, because it seems like the cheapest place to fly into at that time of year, but I'm open to suggestions. It would be a one way flight, with us ending our trip in a different city, and then flying out of there.

First, I wanted to state that I already searched the subreddit and found older threads with similar but different questions.  Most are about traveling with a passport that has a maiden name on it. Basically the opposite of my problem.

Some details: Several months ago, I booked a trip via United Airlines using points.  The flight is in mid January, over a month away.  We are both US citizens.  No flights are on United, only other Star Alliance airlines. The ticket was purchased with my wife's maiden name.  We have since been married, and I noticed her passport was set to expire in August.  I believe that many countries require six months of validity before expiration when you travel.  While all of our travel is in January, I wanted to be safe and update her passport in the event of extenuating circumstances.  I did some research, and saw that United will make name corrections in the event of legal name changes.  With this information, we went ahead and renewed her passport under her new last name.

We just received the updated passport in the mail, and I called United to make the change.  They stated that they are unable to make changes on the tickets because the tickets are through the Star Alliance partners (Lufthansa, Thai Airways, Air Canada). They said they made an OSI notation on the ticket, but cannot force anything else. Had the tickets been on United operated flights, the change could have been made.  It is quite possible I misunderstood what was told to me before, but I thought I was doing the right thing.

I am now quite paranoid that we will not be able to travel. I am also rather upset with myself, as we likely would have been fine had we just not updated her passport.  Does anyone have any advice, or been in similar situations before? 

I have read some advice for similar issues, such as traveling with your marriage certificate.  I'm not sure how much help that will be to me in other countries though. We also have her license still in her maiden name, as well as her old passport that has been invalidated.  Is it worth contacting the passport agency and changing her passport back to her maiden name via expedited service? Would that set off more alarm bells? To further complicate things, I have already booked our domestic flights within Thailand using her new name.  So even if I somehow change her passport back to her maiden name, I'm worried about those flights as well.  Can I use her license as ID for domestic Thai travel?

Thank you for any help.  I apologize for such a long post, I wanted to include as many details as possible.  I really hope I didn't ruin our honeymoon.  With so many moving parts and different airlines it is such a headache. 

Update: I was able to speak with Air Canada and Lufthansa.  Both told me that they cannot make changes to the ticket, and any changes would need to occur with the issuing airline.  Air Canada said they have the same policy as United; they can amend a ticket with a legal name change, but only if the flights were booked through AC and all flights were through AC.  I called United again, and spoke to a supervisor.  They agree that what I was told before is correct, name changes can be made in United's system for United flights.  However, they can't do anything about alliance partners, and can't guarantee what their policies will be.  Any name change they make will get my wife's flight canceled on the other airlines.  They offered to cancel the flights and refund all points and fees, giving me the option to rebook with the updated name. However, this won't work as my flight options are very slim, and with far longer transit times. It seems I'm really in a difficult situation.  I asked them to make a notation in my account, and i would think about what I will do.  I'm now thinking it may be best I try contacting the passport agency near me and seeing if we can get a new passport in her maiden name.  I agree that the airlines probably will allow us to board if we bring as much backup info as possible, but it is a pretty big risk.  I'm going to be at the airport tomorrow as well, I will see if speaking to someone in person can yield any other results.  

Lesson learned, don't try to change passenger information, especially when multiple airlines are involved. I'd be happy to hear any other opinions on what my next steps should be. "

I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?  
  
Any other tips that the beginners guide may not tell me?  
  
Any scams I should avoid? ie. ""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""  
  
I'll add more questions later, in the meantime any other advice you can give me from what I stated would be appreciated. If you have any questions for me I will answer them as soon as possible.  "

My first question is what do I need to do in advance besides:

-vaccinations
-airline ticket
-travel insurance
-power of attorney
-getting a passport

Is there any other things that if I dont get done may hinder my ability to get into those countries?  For example is there anything I have to bring to the airport or customs either because I am a minor or because I am just a traveller? 

Also, say my flight is overbooked and they ask people to leave (fyi I'm flying united) can they kick a minor of the plane? (No I am not flying as an unaccompanied minor) 

Next, I want to pack light, so does anyone know any good packing videos for travelling to France and Germany?

Also, if anyone has any other tips of advice just lmk. Thks sorry if it's a long post im just really nervous.

  &nbsp;
  
So, I'm going to Brazil in September with a layover in Mexico city (both ways).
  &nbsp;
  
My uncle in Brazil used his flyer miles (or something) to pay for my airfare, and his wife finally gave me my flight details.  I expected to see good old United, which is the only airlines that my uncles uses when flying abroad.  Instead, I saw he picked AeroMexico, both ways.

  &nbsp;
  
Never having heard of AeroMexico, I did a simple Google search and got very worried.  Most of recent reviews are very bad, from ""lost seats"" to layover hell/missed connecting flight.  My main worry is having to buy a ticket if I happen to ""miss"" my connecting flight, since I won't be able to afford it.

  &nbsp;
  
I've already asked my uncle to change the dates of the flight... So before I bother my him again about changing airlines (and possibly lose my flight to Brazil altogether), I'd like to know what are your reviews, experiences, and even suggestions and hints on AeroMexico.

66,Who's responsible for my ripped baggage?

Upon arrival in Germany, I retrieved my bags from the carousel to find a giant tear along the zipper of one of my checked bags.  Luckily, it appears I did not lose anything too important, at first glance.

My problem now is whom might I contact regarding this baggage handling?  I would like some form of compensation, at best a replacement luggage bag.  I booked my tickets through Vayama (who is of course not at fault) and the carrier listed for my flights was Air Canada.

The trip had three legs, all listed as Air Canada flights on my itinerary but through code-share airlines use, there were different carriers for each leg:

1st Leg) My hometown to Chicago - United ::::
2nd Leg) Chicago to Montreal - Air Canada :::::
3rd Leg) Montreal to Germany (final destination) - Lufthansa

Is Air Canada the airline which should be responsible for this?  The original baggage stickers I received were from United, and so those baggage numbers might not be in AC's system.  I did not have to re-check my bags at any point in my journey.  Any advice here whom I contact?

I called CheapOair, was hung up on 2 times and was told the 3rd time that I will receive a call back later once they've spoken to Qantas.  I spoke with Qantas 3 times and they said that they have not received any call from CheapOair. They said that the flight was cancelled and that only CheapOair could rebook the flight. I spoke with AA twice and they said that only Qantas or the booking agent could make the changes.

Since CheapOair is not willing to rebook my flight, do I book a flight out of pocket and do a chargeback to CheapOair?  What are my options?

After being unable to get a replacement flight out I had to cancel my return flight as I wasn't even remotely nearby to use it.

Before I even returned home virgin had given me travel credits worth more than my flight and also quickly refunded my ticket when I called them (although it was odd they didn't do both at once).

On the flip side I called United whereby their clearly foreign customer service was barely able to understand the fact that I wanted to cancel my flight let alone get a refund, but was informed that I had to ""apply"" for one instead of doing it over the phone. I did so and received this response 10 days (!) later:

> We're sorry to hear your plans changed. While the fare rules don't allow a refund or name change, you can exchange your ticket for future travel. A service charge as well as any applicable fare difference will be applied at the time of the exchange.

While I expected a small charge, the exchange fee was $200 out of the ~$230 fare (!!!!). This, to me is absurd, especially given the fact that the change in plans was completely out of my hands. It seems even more absurd (and downright corrupt) that they would charge almost 90% of the original flight as an exchange fee for a flight that they no doubt filled anyway without me being there.

TL;DR - had an outbound flight (via Virgin) canceled for a weekend trip while in the airport and had to cancel my return flight (via United) but they refuse to refund me and are trying to charge me 90% of the flight cost as an ""exchange fee"" to apply the rest to a different flight.

So, long story short, is there anything I can do here, besides never fly United again? I have absolutely no intention of trying to use the $30 left and would much rather tell them to go fuck themselves in whatever way costs them the most amount of money."
69,Frequent Travelers: What are your credit cards for miles and using internationally?,8,1v1am8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1v1am8/frequent_travelers_what_are_your_credit_cards_for/,19,2014-01-12 19:21:19,"In researching past top posts on /r/travel and current card options, many companies have changed their products within the last year. I'm refreshing the topic for new opinions and recommendations while providing a summary of 3 best options I found based on points/miles and travel perks vs cost of the card. 

**Assumptions:** /r/travel is on a tight budget,  will pay the monthly bill, use the card for day to day transactions while traveling, wants flexibility in getting and using miles or points, may use the credit card for supplemental insurance or emergency assistance.

**Credit Cards for Points and Traveling**
 
* [*Chase Sapphire Preferred*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=chase+sapphire+prefered)  - 1:1 points transfer to participating frequent flyer programs. 40,000 points if you spend $3,000 in the first 3 months. Double points on travel and dining, an additional point per dollar for hotels and airline bookings through their Ultimate Rewards Program. 5,000 points for an additional user. NO travel insurance/assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 annual fee, waived for the first year. 15.99% APR, 0% first year.

* [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) - 40,000 bonus miles if you spend $1,000 in the first 90 days. Double miles on all purchases. $200,000 travel accident insurance. Trip cancellation/interruption coverage. Emergency Assistance.

     No foreign Transaction fees. $89 Annual fee, waived the first year. 14.99% or 18.99% based on credit, 0% for first year.

* [*United/Chase MileagePlus Explorer*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Chase+MileagePlus+Explorer) - 30,000 miles if you spend $1,000 on the first 3 months. 5,000 miles for an additional user. Double miles on United flights.  10,000 miles per calender year if you spend more than $25,000.  NO Travel insurance or assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 transaction fee, waived first year. 15.24% APR, NOT waived for first year.

**Other card considerations:** Other carrier specific cards (ie [Citi AAdvantage](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Citi+AAdvantage), [American Express/Delta SkyMiles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Delta+SkyMiles)) do not offer as much flexibility as other cards and have been disregarded. [American Express Platinum](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=American+Express+Platinum) has reduced their benefits and rewards over the last year without reducing the $450 annual fee. 

**tl;dr** I researched credit cards to be used for travel and found the [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) to be the best current option. What have been your experiences and what are your recommendations?

I have a United trip coming up to Europe that involves a flight on Austrian Airlines from Vienna to Amsterdam, and I am planning on using an Osprey Porter 46 as my carry on with no checked bags.

Size wise, I know this fits their carry on limits, however it also says they have a carry on weight limit of 8 kg.  Does anybody know how strict Austrian Airlines is with this, and if they actually weigh the carry ons? It will be tough to stay under this limit for a 2 week trip (and the weight limit on the other 2 United flights are MUCH higher).

It costs extra to be able to have them in the cabin with you, and I don't feel comfortable with them being stowed away with luggage. In addition, her dog used to have seizures occasionally but she (the dog)has been better; however, the vet said that if she has several seizures in a row or they last more than 10 minutes that she needs to go to the vet.

The main reason why don't want the airline to handle our dogs in any way is because of incidents like [this](http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2017/02/united_airlines_says_it_is_not.html) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFfEngL2fj4).

So, as for my question, is Frontier Airlines a good choice? They're cheapest, but is flying something I should cheap out on?  I can't afford any day-long delays or anything.

 The next price up is about $400 at United Airlines. I honestly can't afford to go any higher than this.

78,Airplane travel tips: how not to get stuck with a middle seat.,6,l45tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/l45tx/airplane_travel_tips_how_not_to_get_stuck_with_a/,18,2011-10-07 18:48:15,"Whenever I see a post on Reddit about air travel, I am amazed at the amount of contentious comments that get posted, and the sheer lack of knowledge on how to play the airline industry game. 

From a frequent traveller, here are some tips on how NOT to get shafted on seating when booking your next trip:

- Use a site like matrix.itasoftware.com to plan your trip. I prefer the old matrix1.itasoftware.com engine - less user friendly, but oh so flexible. It'll give you fully inclusive fares and let you do LOTS of fancy stuff like specify routings, airlines, number of stops, etc. It takes some work but you will find a great fare on here.
- Check the seatmaps! If you have a choice between two similarly priced flights and one only has middle seats while the other's wide open, take the second flight - you'll be more comfortable.
- Check seatguru.com for red lights on certain seats and airlines. Airlines like Spirit only offer 28"" of seat pitch^1 on some of their planes. And you thought the airline average 31"" seat pitch was bad...
- While you're on the airline's website, check into preferred/premium seating options. Most airlines nowadays offer the option to upgrade to exit rows, premium economy, etc for a set fee. Know your options!
- Once you figure out your flights, you can book directly by calling the airlines. Know the flight and seat numbers you want so you can say ""I want AC441 on this date, seat 13A."" 
- Book early, at least three weeks out. This will give you better fares, a better seat selection, and more time to shop around. 
- If you MUST book last minute (and it does happen), compare the flights that day. You can easily check seating charts for most airlines now, or pay for the priority access on free for all airlines like southwest.
- **NEVER leave your seat selection up to chance.** If you can pay for seating in advance (or in Southwest's case, priority boarding), do it, especially if you're travelling as a group. This will minimize the possibility of getting stuck in a middle seat, and the ""my boyfriend and I must sit together, can you trade your exit row aisle seat for my middle in the back next to the toilet?""^2 game. 
- **NEVER leave your seat selection up to chance.**  Yes, I'm putting in there twice. This is especially vital if you have kids - don't be that mom standing in the middle of the aisle with three kids desperately trying to get people around you to swap a prime aisle seat for your kid's middle ten rows back - it's inconsiderate and it adds extra stress to what's already a stressful situation.
- If you do get stuck in a situation where you want a seat swap, always offer the best seat to the person you're asking to trade. Window or aisle is better than middle, front is better than back. Also realise that no one HAS to swap. It's nice if they do, but you are not entitled to it. I know people that pick seats for very specific reasons like me - I'm claustrophobic as fuck and I will not swap from my window to an aisle or middle for that reason. If you ask someone to swap and they say no, accept it, don't throw a hissy fit because you can't sit next to your boyfriend for a few hours.
- If you're extra tall, stop bitching about the leg room on planes and do something about it. We all know it sucks, but there are things you can do to make it better. Book E+ on United, pay for an exit row (most airlines let you do this now), look at airlines that offer extra legroom like JetBlue.
- If you get stuck in a crappy seat, keep checking back, especially in the last week before your departure. This is when all the upgrades for frequent flyers come through, and they always have the best seats. I've gone from 28B to 13A (my favourite seat on the Airbus 319) just by checking back once a day to see if any seats opened up. 
- Truly frequent flyers might want to look into a subscription to ExpertFlyer.com which lets you set up alerts that will email you if an aisle or window seat becomes available. This site has saved my butt more than once.
- Sometimes, airlines offer what's called a Last Minute Upgrade (LMU) at checkin. If it's available, it's usually a pretty good deal - much cheaper than paying for business class up front, and especially nice for extra long/overnight flights. Don't discount it offhand because it costs money - if you're travelling solo and stuck in a middle in the back on an overnight flight, that LMU is your ticket to comfort and a good night's sleep.

Obviously we can't account for everything here - sometimes things just happen that are out of your control like equipment swapping. Make sure to check your reservation once in a while as you get closer to your departure dates, as sometimes the airlines will mess about with your seating, turning your prime reservation into a mess, or scattering your family around the plane. If this happens and you can't correct it online with the seatmap, CALL! Do not let them put you off with stuff like ""they'll fix it at the airport at checkin"". That will become ""they'll fix it at the gate"" which will become ""the FA will fix it"" which turns into ""just ask people around you to trade"". Do not let them put you off. If the first agent won't help you, hang up and call back until you find one who will (also known as Agent Roulette, a very effective strategy and one I've used myself to great success). 

1) [Seat Pitch](http://www.uk-air.net/seatpitch.htm) is the distance between the rows of seats and is measured from the back of one seat to the back of the seat behind, the measurements being taken from the same position on each seat. Don't assume that 31"" of pitch is the same across all airlines and planes - older planes often have thicker seats that take up more room, whereas newer planes will offer an extra inch or two of legroom for the same amount of seat pitch. Do your research!

2) I've had this exact scenario happen. I said no, told her to ask the person in the back if they'd like to come up to the front instead.

**TL;DR:** Book your seats in advance, keep checking back for better seats/airline shenanigans, don't leave it to chance on the plane.

The important details (I think) are that I bought the plane ticket from CheapOAir. There will be 2 stops, one within the United States and one in China. The three of these flights were bought at the same time as part of the same ticket, not separately. 

The flight looks like this

Cincinnati-Washington             With United

Washington-Beijing                 With Air China

Beijing-Chengdu                     With Air China

It was a digital ticket, nothing that was mailed to me and all that I have is an E ticket number and some Airline Confirmation numbers. 

My questions is this.
My Airport only has a check in for United, not Air China. Does that mean I will have to do a separate check in with Air China while in Washington or will I receive my boarding pass for all three flights from United at the start? 
I've been told that they are both part of some sort of alliance and I shouldn't have to do that or even move my bags to the new aircraft on my own. Is that true? Is so could someone explain the process? 
Does anyone have any experience with these two airlines on the same ticket?
Thanks!"

It would mean alot if you could help me out. Also feel free to correct me if I get anything wrong.

1. The website says that I'm allowed to carry two bags with each bag having maximum weight of 23kg and each bag having maximum combined width, height and length of 62 inches or 157 cm. How serious does the airline get about the size? The issue is that my bag isn't angular, it is curved on one side to provide more area to stuff things in. Measuring from the end of the curve makes me over the size, but measure from the edge makes under the limit.

2. Do bag regulations change when you're flying through different international airports?

3. What should I keep in mind while doing connections ? I will have around 3 hours in each airport 

4. What should i keep in mind during the immigration when i get off in the US? I'm travelling for education and have all the documents ready.

5. Do the planes have charging spots for phones and iPads?

6. Any pro tips ?

7. What should be my highest and least concern while packing and travelling?

8. If in case my bag is overweight or something, the website mentions prices I have to pay, do I have to pay money at each airport I go through ?

I have a hotel booked in Cebu which i havent been paying for and not able to get to for the last 4 days(2 due to delay and 2 due to lost baggage).  The weather delayed the initial flight which i can take, but the last 2 days is due to United and EVA airlines negligence.

Due to a 5 hour delay in LAX, Eva Air put me on a United flight for the rest of the trip.  This is where my bags got lost.  I even called Eva air at this point to make sure my bags would make it, they reassured me that they will arrive. 

 I arrived in Manila two days ago, bags werent here.  They said they would arrive tomorrow, so i missed another flight and had to pay for a room in Manila when i have a room in Cebu still waiting for me.  They told me to come back yesterday and theyll be here by 5pm.  Called them before i went and they confirmed they would be here.  I spent 10 hours at the airport yesterday and they never arrived (cancelled 6 hours of classes for my job).  

I talked to United, they said my bags were still in LAX. Why would they tell me to get them at the airport then?!  I then talked to EVA, they said they are in Taipei since the 15th (3 days ago!!!).  This has gone back and forth and for some reason the airlines refuse to contact eachother and figure it out.

Its now today and United says the bag is still in LAX.  EVA says its still in Taipei.  They have no idea when it will arrive.  Neither are taking responsibility and refusing any compensation for the 2 nights of hotels i had to stay in Manila while waiting for my bag that never came.  Now, i need to buy new clothes and toiletries.  Im exhausted, irate, and wish I never even came on this vacation.

Im heading to Cebu today to actually experience my vacation outside of an airport.  Its been 4 days of airports.  I doubt ill get any compensation and probably will never see my bag again.  This is a warning, stay away from United and EVA; they do not value you as a customer.

UPDATE:

EVA called about an untagged bag and asked if i had an inflatable bed in it. This was not my bag, my bag was tagged and has locks on it! They still dont know where it is, but they are claiming it is in possession of United. When asked about compensation for the new clothes i need to buy, they said to contact United even though EVA was who i booked my ticket from and is the only airline confirmed to be in possession of my bag from Chicago to LA. I dont know why they think it might be in Taipei, arent they supposed to scan the tags for each arrival and departure?!

UPDATE 2:

Bags were in United's hands, so I wont blame EVA.  United has no idea where my bags are still (day 3).  No offer of compensation for my lost luggage or hotels i stayed at because they told me my luggage would be arriving the next day.  They have no timeline when ill see them again.  At least they admit this now instead of having me wait for them for days.

I left to Cebu yesterday because i have no confidence in my bags being found.  Buying new clothes and toiletries today, going to swim with sharks tomorrow :).  Time for vacation!"

My girlfriend and I booked a flight a week ago through United. The flight used Air Canada and Swiss Airlines, but was all through United. After booking we got an e-mail saying that our reservation could take up to 24 hours to be confirmed through Swiss Airlines and to call United for more information.

We called United and were told that Swiss Airlines had to confirm our flight and that we would be notified if there were any problems. We never heard anything back from United and assumed all had gone smoothly. A few days later we noticed our credit card was never charged and called United. Our confirmation number no longer existed and our flight was canceled without us being informed.

We were told that we could rebook the same flight, but that the price was 300 dollars more per person. After going back and forth on the price for an hour we found out that the exact same flight was listed on the United website for $300 less (the original price we tried to pay a week prior). When I told the customer service rep this she said ""Fine, book it online then."" and hung up.

After booking online we once again received an e-mail saying that Swiss Airlines hadn't confirmed the flight and that we needed to call United. The first time I called United I was told that the flight was totally booked and the waiting list was full. We were told that we had to book another flight, but on the United website the flight we wanted was still available...so I called Swiss Airlines directly. They told me that they confirmed our flight and that everything looked fine on their end. I called back United and explained this...the customer service rep did not believe me and told me the flight was full. I insisted he call Swiss Airlines. After 45 minutes on hold, the rep hung up on me.

Once again I called back United, and explained the situation to another representative. He also told me the flight was sold out but agreed to call Swiss Airlines and put me on hold. 35 minutes later he came on the line and apologized to me saying that Swiss Airlines had confirmed our flight but for some reason the United computers weren't seeing that and he was unable to book our flight. He offered us a different flight....for 400 dollars more per ticket.

The representative told me that since Swiss Airlines confirmed our flight and United wasn't able to see that, that the issue could be fixed by technical support. He transferred me over to technical support where another representative told me that the flight was full and the waiting list full. I explained to her FIVE TIMES that the reason I was calling was because that wasn't true. I explained that Swiss Airlines confirmed the flight and she eventually agreed to call them.

When she got back on the phone with me (another 45 minutes) she apologized and said ""You're right, the flight is not full-- but the price of the flight has gone up and is now $300 more per ticket"". She told me that I would have to wait another 24 hours for them to confirm the flight at the new price and even then there was no promise the price wouldn't go up again. ALL THE WHILE the United website still displayed the original price we were told. I explained that we tried booking twice already and that since the problem was with United's computers that we shouldn't be responsible for paying the extra fee. Even Swiss Airlines confirmed multiple times that they CONFIRMED the flight for the price we wanted.

I was told that there was never any technical issue and that all the other reps who told me the flight was full misspoke and actually meant the tickets at the prices we wanted were full, and that we'd have to book at a higher price.

So after 5 hours on the phone, we don't have any tickets. We were constantly lied to, told we were wrong, etc... and even after Swiss Airlines confirmed our flight, United told us that the price was now more expensive and refused to work with Swiss Air or compensate us at all. DISGUSTING. Never again will I fly United."

I checked the United Airlines (the airline I'm flying's) website, which said that instruments could be brought if they fit in the hand luggage section, and if they don't, a seat must be bought for them. Has anyone else brought a hard case on as a carry on item? If so, have you had any issues with doing so? Also, can an acoustic electric in a hard case, practically fit in a TSA scanner? 

Thanks in advance!

96,We left my wife's wedding ring on a United jet.

My wife is completely distraught because the only decent item we actually own (don't have a loan on it) has been lost.  Here's the story:

Late last night my wife and I were flying home from a wedding when her purse, which was sitting on the floor, fell over during takeoff.  We heard a few things fall out and picked up what we could.  We thought we had picked up everything, but this morning my wife realized that her wedding ring was missing.  

She doesn't usually take it off in public places but last night she slipped it off to put on some hand lotion and she put it inside her purse.  So we're pretty sure that it was lost on the airplane when her purse fell over.  

So we've been frantically trying to get in touch with somebody at United who can help us out.  Apparently all requests like this have to go through their online lost and found form.  The (not so friendly) customer service reps refused to do anything other than repeatedly point me to the website and literally tell me ""good luck with that.""

So I drove back to the airport and spoke with the United Airlines customer service people who assured me that they would try to find it.  But honestly they didn't seem very optimistic about our prospects.  

Again, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I would **really** appreciate any help on this .  The ring is really unique to us - it's an antique from the 1920s (our favorite period of literature) and can't be replaced.  We were both teachers when we got engaged 4 years ago and I can't tell you how many extra hours of tutoring I put in to save up the money to buy the ring.

Edit: I also tried my arriving airport's lost and found.  No dice.

98,Travel Hints & Tips. How the airline industry works.,7,730arx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/730arx/travel_hints_tips_how_the_airline_industry_works/,16,2017-09-28 18:07:22,"**Before you read the post, keep in mind that may not be relevant for someone who travels a few times during the year domestically within the United States to see family or for work. On the other hand the article was based and targeting international travelers. This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing.**


Back in the 80s and 90s shopping for air tickets was so much simpler. The airlines used to offer 3 fares. One for economy, one for business and one for first (for the airlines that offered it.) Everyone traveling economy for example would pay the same. (so no one was upset for paying more than the person next to them or some cousin who was bragging that paid less…) The reason about this was that when the tickets were “paper” and were physical items most agencies would pre-purchase and then set a price of how much they wanted to sell for the traveling season. (which also leaded to black market too in some cases. Having strong ethnic agencies that used to monopolize their markets, buying huge amounts of ticket stock and selling it to higher prices with huge margin of profit since they could do that. They could buy lots of ticket stock, make reservations and be able to hold them for weeks (can’t do this now), or book fake names to hold the space in flights and then change the name to whoever was traveling since there was so easy and without fees to change the names of the travelers.


What changed?


The airlines hated the fact of scheduling flights that could cost thousands of dollars without knowing if the flights will be full and sometimes sending half empty planes. They removed the paper tickets and changed the game. They introduced the “classes of service”! If let’s say on a flight there are 300 seats, and the cabins are broken down to 30 business class tickets, 70 premium economy and 200 economy tickets, each cabin is broken down to classes of service. Economy for example, those 200 seats are divided to a dozen of different economy fares that change every 9 tickets are sold. Example 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F 9G. The first 9 people will call they will buy at the price of the A class that may be $800, next 9 travelers will pay the higher tier economy, B which may be $900 etc. The highest economy may be at $1800-2000 and this is the same cabin and the same seats that someone paid probably $800 or less. The way this system works, benefits the airlines since the travelers must rush and try to buy way ahead of time to make sure they ll get the lowest economy class of service or else they will end up paying way more. The travelers cant wait till last moment anymore when there was only one economy fare out there. So it is a game between all of us the travelers. Whoever calls first and the earliest gets the good fares. On top of that, when you make get a reservation now days, you cant hold it for more than 1-2 days. (before the agents could hold them for weeks). Not to mention the penalties. Most tickets are non refundable (with an exception of death). All tickets have penalties when you try to change them and the list going on. Keep in mind in domestic and international tickets, the lowest ones (lowest classes of service) come with some harsh rules behind them. Such as you don’t get miles or you can accumulate a very low amount of them. You are not allowed to travel with a luggage (unless you pay extra at the airport). Usually those tickets are non refundable and non changeable. (If you must change something, then you lose the ticket and you have to buy new one). Not to mention you can pre-select your seating assignment. 


When buying tickets be very careful. For domestic traveling always go directly to the airlines. They keep that portion of market for themselves. Which means, you aren’t going to get a better deal anywhere else. For international traveling though, all the airlines are giving a big portion of their deals and discounted fares to consolidators and wholesalers that they provide smaller agencies and websites with airfares. So when it comes to international traveling, then you may get a lower fare from an A Airline via an agency or a website than the airline itself. (Because the A Airline may have an agreement with the B travel agency to give them the right and sell their discounted deals). Many are complaining about the fares and fees. Well traveling is not a cheap “sport” any more. As about the competition, well, someone may say “but there are so many airlines”. True, but most of these airlines have merged into bigger alliances. The world’s major carriers have merged into 3-4 big groups that they expanded their “city service networks” and share price and policies. So instead for 20-30 airlines, they are basically 3. So for us the consumers, we get the one or the two of them from each city. (this mean we get 1 or 2 fares to pick from) The one or the other airline alliance. (some major cities are luckier because they may get all 3 alliances plus some other ethnic carriers that don’t belong to any of the big groups and they are just offering an extra choice of airfare. 


Seating Assignment has become a joke too now days. It used to be free, yet the past years the airlines discovered this idea to sell the seating pre-assignment. You buy your tickets on April to travel in June and you want to assign the seats. You have to pay a fee. (Makes me wonder what we will pay next). Luckily you can go get the free seat assignment at the airport the day of your departure.
Travel insurance. Often I get asked about it. Another way for the agencies to make profit. Most airlines and the trip insurances waive and forgive penalties if you are very sick. But only if you are sick. Neither the airlines nor the travel insurance will cover you for any other reason. (yet many don’t realize this and buy insurance anyways). Some major airlines will cover you and waive the fees if you are really sick, so no reason to buy any insurance. Unless of course you booked with one of the few carriers that do not accept medical reasons for cancellations or changes. Then it is worth it. Although most of the times it is a waste of money. You end up paying way too much and sometimes it is not needed if the airline covers you for medical reasons anyways. 
Nothing is guaranteed either. Penalties, fares, fees, all are subject to change. Even your paid seating assignment. Basically the airlines under their guidelines can do anything they want and you can’t do a thing about it. 


When you try to book keep in mind to search for at least 4-5 months in advance from the month you want to travel. (this is for international tickets, not domestic tickets within the U.S.) The airlines have introduced this term called “advance purchase” which it works to discourage travelers and overcharges them if they try to call within a week or two from their desired departure date to buy tickets. If let’s say an economy ticket cost $1000 (if you book it a month or more in advance). If you try to buy the same ticket within three or four weeks, or like sometimes people do, within one or two weeks the price skyrockets. That same ticket ends up costing $2000-$3000. So try avoiding booking within a week or two and last minute tickets. It was a time that worked well for deals, but not anymore. 


So what about the Special Sales?


Prices go down once in a while too, as sales/demand mandates. The airlines monitor their flights and once the sales drop, in order for the to fill the flights they release ""special sales"" to fill up the flights. Remember the goal is to send the aircraft full.


These hints and tips are applying mainly to the big carriers. (such as Delta, United, American, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, etc). Low cost carriers such as Spirit, Southwest, Ryan Air etc that sell tickets directly from their websites and not through any of the official reservation platforms around the globe, they are a different story and most of the above information isn't applying for them.


I am sure there are certain exceptions to all the above but this is how the airline industry works now days, the majority of the times. Hope it helps. Good ticket hunting."

My hangup is the flight.

I haven't flown much in my life, less than ten total flights. I have a bit of a height issue (I wouldn't call it fear), and I don't like not being in control. The safety record is well known to me, but still it persists. There's two areas that I could use some advice/feedback on.

**Comfort:** It takes a perfect scenario for me to get to sleep. I am a stomach sleeper, as much as I've tried to change that. I doubt I will be getting much sleep sitting up in a cramped seat, but I am trying out ANC headphones, pillows, etc now to see what might assist. I am of average height, so legroom isn't a huge deal. I'm not thin, but I also don't come close to overflowing  the confines of my seat. The more I can't fall asleep, the more anxious I get about falling asleep and it cascades. All the flights from Atlanta to London are overnight, which works for our itinerary, but I'm worried I will be a mess trying to function even until dinner time. The only other overnight flight I've taken was from SFO-ATL, and I slept perhaps thirty minutes. It wasn't very fun.

**Cost:**The above dovetails into price. I can find RT tix ATL-LHR for about $650 ($1300 for both of us) in lowest level economy via a third party off Skyscanner. Now, I've seen plenty of advice that says to book with the airline, but that bumps it up to $890pp. I could then upgrade off that if I care to. Premium Economy is running roughly double my original $650pp ticket. Is some more legroom worth double? Is being able to select your seat worth $110? We're hoping to travel light, just a carry on bag for us each.

I just have no frame of reference to know if the $650pp deal is good, to not buy third party, and if it's worth double to change from Economy Basic to Premium Economy (the carrier I am basing all this off of is BA, but it seems to be the same for Delta, et al). Since we've never really traveled, we have no loyalty, points, or anything other than currency to use. We hope this is the beginning of the second half of our lives traveling more, but we are starting basically from scratch. In a similar manner, I have no idea which airlines and which planes are better than others, only that a ton of people are not impressed with United.

I know I've seen this asked a few dozen times but if you're on the website for the airline (in this case British Airways), and they have an option with only a 1 hour layover, they obviously think you can make it correct? Here's what I'm looking at. It will save me about $200 from the United flights I was looking at. Note, I'll only have a carry on.

Per person, they paid about 600 dollars, whereas the cheapest I can find is almost 1,000 dollarydoos (938 to be exact). Even when putting on ""my dates are flexible"" and leaving +/-3 days from the actual date, it's pretty much the same price. 

Does anyone have any idea why this might be the case, and if there is some way to get the tickets for the same price that they bought them at? I'm piss poor at this and feel like a fish out of water when it comes to finding a airline ticket, as the last time I flew was about 10 years ago. 

I'm going to keep checking prices for the next few weeks and see if they magically go down again, but if possible I'd really like to spend less on the tickets, so I can spend more while doing dope shit in Japan. "
103,Information on Beijing airport and security when flying to Tokyo?,2,ckg6rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ckg6rr/information_on_beijing_airport_and_security_when/,16,2019-08-01 03:25:00,"Hello everyone, I am planning a trip to Japan this upcoming spring and found a great deal for tickets but I'm worried about the layover time for the flight there between Beijing and Tokyo. 

My partner and I have both decided to aim for layovers of at least 2 hours to ensure that we can make our connecting flight in a decent amount of time without having to sprint across the airport. We've had several situations where the wait time between flights were under 2 hours and we were 5-10 minutes away from missing our next flights because either security took forever or our previous flight was delayed. This happened with westjet, aircanada and united airlines and we hated it so we want to avoid that if we can.

However, this great flight has a layover for 1hr and 40 minutes in Beijing and I'm wondering if anyone has been to Beijing airport and possibly even took a flight from there to tokyo and how the experience was. Was it super chaotic and did security take forever? Do you think 1hr40 mins is enough? If we miss the flight are there quite a bit of flights going back and forth? 

Also, what are your experiences with air china? The planes we would take are both air china and I would like to know if they're known for having delays or if they're usually punctual? I've never flown with air china or any planes outside of the ones mentioned earlier and they've all been delayed for me so that also plays a role in catching connecting flights!

My bf and I will be traveling in Rome and Venice for a week. We'll be flying out from the United States and I figure we could do around 3 days in Rome and 3 days in Venice.

My question is about the logistics from traveling to Venice from Rome.

We'll be having 3 luggage bags with us (2 small carry-on and 1 large luggage bag).

Would the best way to travel from Rome to Venice (with all of our luggage) be using the Trenitailia or taking an airline for a small flight. 

Is there any other forms of transportation we can use to get to Venice from Rome?

Another question outside of logistics, anything that I should be aware of when traveling in Rome or Venice. Any good restaurant recommendations are greatly appreciated!

I'm lookin online, but I'm hoping someone with first hand experience can help. I recently took a trip and met a wonderful person there. She stayed at the same hostel and we kinda fell for each other. Her itinerary is set to go to Kentucky, but she intends to get off where I live in San Francisco. She can just get off the plane, but her checked luggage is set to go to the final destination.

Any advice for what I can do? I'm going to do more research, but I'll be monitoring this post as I know the power of the collective knowledge of reddit!

\*Update\*

I called the airline and they have submitted my request, but it's pending approval. I'll go to the airport early and see if anything can be done. This was a really last minute, spontaneous, romantic thing and though we met in Hawaii, she's international and her English skills aren't great (we share a common language). I'm thankful to all of you who helped shed light on this situation.

*update 2*
I showed up at the airport early and explained the situation. The lady at the counter was very understanding and she even waived the “shorting” fee. In reading some of the responses, I tend to agree that my actions, though unintentional, could make things harder for travelers. Sometimes we are blind to everything to our circumstances, but I’m glad we were able to take care of everything and have a happy result.

For anyone who might be curious, I was at San Francisco and it was a united airlines itinerary. I was asked for a itinerary, passenger name and baggage claim numbers. I provided that and was told that my friend would default on the rest of her flights and that there was a fee of $200. The ticket professional was typing in stuff when I asked her (very nicely and super politely) if there was anything we can do about the fee. I gave her a super quick summary of the situation and she said something like, “that’s very sweet, don’t worry about the fee, the computer doesn’t seem to be working very well anyways”.

Again, thanks everyone for your insight and feedback. My friend and I are very grateful :)"

The info: My flight is on the 8th of july to London, Ontario, and my returning flight to the US is on the 10th. 

Basically, do I NEED a passport to fly into Canada if I'm a US citizen and can prove so? (birth certificate, social security, driver's license, receipt for new passport, etc.) My father, who traveled a good bit, said I shouldn't really need one if I'm a citizen, and googling this has also corroborated his statement. To make double sure, I called united airlines customer support and they said that since I'm a US citizen, all I need is my birth certificate and driver's license, although I may go through extra security checks. To make triple sure, me and my father went to the passport agency to go ahead and renew my passport, (a few days too late to expedite it in time it seems) and the worker said confidently that if I'm going to Canada, that I do not need a passport, just a birth certificate and driver's license.


Can someone please tell me if I will be okay or not? I really do not know what to think. I have a receipt for the passport I just ordered, would bringing that along be a good idea? 

UPDATE: Finally got a hold of Air Canada, they confirmed along with many of you that I need the passport to fly anywhere out the country. I just got off the phone with the lady who did my passport submission as a result of this. She said that the information has already been shipped out but to call her next week. She said that by that time, the passport would already have been fully processed in another location and I can expedite it to get it to me in 3-5 business days, and if they cannot do that, I can setup an appointment with the New Orleans agency and get it printed there. She said not to spend the next days worrying about this, the trip will be made. I think I'm gonna be okay."

110,Booking with Expedia to save $300- throwing my money away? International flight to Bangkok from USA,3,auzk57,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/auzk57/booking_with_expedia_to_save_300_throwing_my/,15,2019-02-26 16:39:30,"Hi /r/Travel :)

&#x200B;

So I've read many of the rather pointed opinions on booking with a 3rd-party agency vs. booking with the airline directly. Instead of asking which is best, I'll ask- what would you do in my scenario?

I can get a round-trip flight to & from my home city in the USA (BNA) to Bangkok (with 2 stops/layovers) for $800 via Expedia, or I can book directly with one of the airlines for $1100+. I understand if there are delays, Expedia might not help me out in the best way- but an airline would take better care of me.

&#x200B;

Second, on the note of travel insurance, If I booked through Expedia, I know to buy travel insurance from an external source- would the travel insurance cover me where Expedia fails? I imagine not booking Expedia's travel insurance would make them even less likely to help me if an issue were to arise.

This being my 3rd international solo trip, I somehow never had to deal with this dilemma. I suppose the multiple legs makes me nervous. The outbound section of the trip is all through ANA (though I can't find a comprable 1-way price on said airline's site).  The return flight is through a combination of Hong Kong Air and United. Being well over 6 ft, I liked the idea of flying ANA for the extra legroom, too! I simply don't want to waste my money booking through Expedia.

&#x200B;

Have you guys had much success booking multiple-legged international trips via Expedia?

My wife and I will be returning from our honeymoon in Vienna Oct 26th and I'm a little concerned about our short layover time in IAD when returning to the states. Before I start we both have Global Entry and are US citizens.

We have a 1 hour and 22 minute layover in IAD coming from Vienna. We're arriving on an Austrian Airlines flight (operated by United) and boarding a United flight back home domestically. From what I understand the process is as follows:

1. Get off flight in terminal B(?) and hop on mobile bus lounge thing to get to terminal C
2. Go through global entry kiosk process
3. Wait for bags and begin sweating profusely from stress
4. Grab bags and haul ass to drop off point, place bags on conveyor belt, or give to person standing there
5. Go through TSA Precheck security again
6. Sprint like Usain Bolt to our flight on United which is hopefully located in terminal C as well, if not D.

Is 1hr22m going to be enough for all this? Did i get the process wrong at all? I'm pretty sure our global entry should cut out 90% of the potential set back but the next flight out isnt until after 10pm and I'd rather not do a red eye with work the next morning. While we've both flown before we're still relatively new to travelling through airports and any advice is greatly appreciated.

In a nutshell 30 hours stuck in airports and airplanes instead of 15 hours. My flight from from Phx to Chicago via United Air was delayed twice, meaning I would have missed my connection to Dublin. This was due to mechanical difficulties with the airplane. 

United put me on a 10 hour flight to London via British Airways. I paid $1,100 to upgrade to business class because I refuse to fly more then  8 hours straight and this was the only way I could get to my family in Ireland without losing my mind. 

Flight to London was great! Then my connection to Dublin via Aer Lingus was delayed twice, 4 hours because the traffic control tower was having problems. Finally got on my flight and landed in Ireland 12 hours late. 

Went to grab my luggage and one piece was “lost”. I made a claim and told them I have medication in my bag. Fam, I don’t normally check meds but I’m here for 2 months and it was a last minute decision to check my carry on. My bad. 

Fast forward to today. I call to check my bags status and it had conveniently arrived in Dublin about 45 minutes before I called. I told them about the medication and the guy said “well it’s not listed on your original claim”. I told him I told the agent the night before and then he said he’d put a rush on delivering it to my cousins address. Yes, I’m in Ireland for 2 months. But only at my cousins outside of Dublin for a few days. 

THEN!!! I checked online and the status basically said “tracking continues, please check later”, so I called again. That time, the woman I spoke w said the London flight it was supposed to be on was canceled and because of the medication she will put an urgent delivery on it. 

Aer Lingus is completely lying to me. Out of pocket I have spent close to $3,000 USD on a $1,500 flight (had to go shopping today to replace some items) and now I’m missing luggage that has clothes, toiletries and meds that I will basically be in the hospital if I don’t have. Thankfully being a bit of a gypsy I always have 4 day back up in my purse. It is officially 25 hours since I landed in Dublin. Still no luggage or a clue as to if I’ll ever see it again 

HOW DO I MAKE THE MOST OUT OF RECEIVING COMPENSATION???? 

If anyone can help me battle the corporate airlines, PLEASE FILL ME IN!!! I have no clue when or if I’ll see my suitcase again. I want full compensation for all of this. 

I love you guys and thank you in advance"

Good morning guys. I wanted to write my frustration with American Airlines. I live down in Miami, but I always drive up to Fort Lauderdale to fly with Southwest. this time,  I, along with my family, flew out of Miami to Chicago. Although I had to pay for bag fees, and dumb seat fees in order for us to sit together, the flight from Miami to Chicago was great.

 On our way back to Miami, we had a connecting flight at Charlotte. First, I paid again the crazy seat fees and bag fee, our flight from Chicago got delayed and lost the connecting flight. Then, they switches us to a flight that was going to Fort Lauderdale. That flight was getting delayed every 30 minutes since 9 p.m. They cancelled it at midnight with the same bad weather excuse, and told us to go to customer service to change it. They delayed and cancelled a bunch of flights that night with the same bad weather excuse. What i found weird was that on the airport screen, I had noticed that Delta, United, and Southwest flights were on time. Only American flights were getting delayed and gate changed every now and then. In conclusion guys, I had to call work to tell them that I couldn't make it to work the next day, buy food, and sleep at the airport with my family. There were pregnant women, little kids, very old people, and American Airlines didn't even give food or place to sleep. I just wanted to share my experience, as I might not fly with them again."

Monday is only 2 days away, so I figured if I do cancel tonight I can still wait until Monday and worst comes to worst - I can just buy a ticket back on United hoping its close to the same price or on Orbitz. I would still guy a ticket going there, as my friend would probably just get me ticket flying back into SFO. 

I picked United right now because I always fly with them, so I was comfortable picking them. But if I cancel with ticket, wait until Monday and then my friend find out he can't get the ticket, I was thinking about just buying on Orbitz like I said, as I see they are going for about 650 USD, which is a really good price. What are the chances I will actually obtain a free ticket? I know its impossible for you guy to know - but do airlines do this?

We'll be flying out of Chicago to Manchester, England; returning from Stockholm to Chicago.  Our best priced options are:

- Icelandair for about $1100 per person (2 stops on return flight)
- SAS for about $900 per person (1 stop each way, reasonable layovers)
- Virgin Atlantic/Air France for about $800 per person (7 hour layover on return flight)


We do have some flexibility.  We can go to Sweden first and then England but we want to be in Sweden over the solstice since there's a big family event that we want to attend.  Going to Sweden first and would push our travel plans into July and prices seem to go up in July.

124,Muslims Eat Rice and Curry,6,2qxd3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2qxd3n/muslims_eat_rice_and_curry/,15,2014-12-31 18:51:13,"I recently flew a united flight from LAX to DXB. The IAD to DXB leg was quite long so I decided to shell out and upgrade to BusinessFirst. That is where the nightmare begins.

After writing the following letter to Jeff Smisek, the CEO of united airlines, I received a phone call back. United thanked me for writing the letter, this of course after I was informed that the Lady I was talking to had been in the business for longer then I have been flying.

Here is the letter for your reading pleasure.

Dear Mr. Hand & Mr. Smisek, 

I recently flew on United Airlines from LAX to DXB to YYZ.  Along the duration of my flight’s there were a number of circumstances which led to this being the most awful travel experience of my flight career, which as a consultant I am in the air 48 weeks a year on business and another 2 weeks a year visiting family.

On my way from LAX to DXB, the flight attendant behaved in a very racist manner towards me, she served me my meal last and responded to any inquiries I had very rudely.  My request for a Halal meal lead to public scorn and embarrassment as your flight attendant very rudely informed me that the Halal meal needed to be ordered 2 hours prior to serving. I did in fact request the specific meal when upgrading my seat prior to departing LAX there seems to be a sort of disconnect within your company. Needless to say the mistreatment from the flight crew negatively impacted my travel experience. As a business first passenger there is a standard of treatment which I expect to be treated in.

But United, you guys never fail to disappoint. The return trip, has to be by far the worst experience I have had in life period. As is I am a 27 year old Muslim Male with a beard. So I am sure you could picture the already prejudice looks I get from, TSA, Airline Employees and fellow passengers. But nothing can top the actions of Ms. Lotta Von “Something” (I couldn't get her last name because when I tried she took her name tag off.)

Ms. Lotta Von X let’s call her, approached  me upon reaching 10,000 feet, Mr.Chagleelee was my name on this flight (I thought literacy was a requirement but OK). I said yes, she said we have the Muslim meal for you.  I said, thank you, but aren't all the meals out of DXB halal? And that is when all hell broke loose.
I was screamed at and publicly humiliated, and I was told that I was not allowed to have any of the meals on the menu because I ordered the Muslim meal.
After being shouted at I asked what was in the Muslim Meal anyway, the response was priceless “rice and curry or whatever you Muslims eat.” At that point I had enough, I began speaking to another Air Host and his apology was truly one of a kind. “Yeah, its ok she can come off like that”. As if expecting me to be patient and understanding with her. Then Ms. Lotta now comes back and refills my sprite with water, which then took her the duration of the flight to rectify because I never got another one from her. As a matter of fact, I had to get up and go the galley to get a drink.

The best part of all of this is that I was sitting next to a Senior Vice President of (Sorry I have to edit this out), who looked at me and said, “I am shocked, I have never seen anything like this.”

The final flight from Dulles to Toronto, there was no Premier access on boarding, no first class or Economy plus, and once again the Gate agent was extremely rude as well as oblivious and unable to effectively respond to my inquiries regarding the flight details. (Please do explain why I am paying an arm and a leg for this?)

My total flight time was around 30 hours which I would consider fairly long, as such I chose to upgrade in order to receive more comfortable seating as well as more personal service. Yes the seating was adequate however the horrific service provided lead me to reconsider my decision of choosing United Airlines entirely. I am an avid flyer and this is the first time I have experienced such poor behavior from crew members and the remainder of the airlines personnel’s.  It seems throughout my multiple flight’s there seems to be some common animosity from the crew members toward the Halal/Muslim meal displaying racist behavior. Would this be ordinary behavior to be expected by United Airlines, if so United Airlines will most definitely not be a part of my future travels plans. The saddest part of all this, this is the first United flight since accepting the premier match challenge. I think I will stay with Delta. In all the flights I have ever taken with them or any other airline for that matter, I have never been as appalled as to write a letter of complaint. I would like to thank you guys for giving me this opportunity to experience a new first.

Given that I do not think Jeff read the email, I sent it out to a couple more Directors and VP's.

126,Why is it that airlines sometimes won't give you a mobile boarding pass?,2,bod5n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bod5n2/why_is_it_that_airlines_sometimes_wont_give_you_a/,13,2019-05-14 06:49:49,"I've been on many flights in the last few years and I've never understood why sometimes I've been told upon check-in that I am not eligible for a mobile boarding pass.  I'm from Canada and I've never had this issue with a domestic flight; the only times this has happened is on international flights.  I've been denied a mobile pass a few times on flights from Canada to the US, but I've often got them on the return flight.  Last year I went to Europe for the first time in a while.  I couldn't get a mobile pass for my flight overseas (the first leg was with Air Canada and the second leg was with SAS and I couldn't get a mobile pass for either flight).  I went on two trips by plane when I was overseas, one was two legs each way (with SAS) and one was one leg each way (with Norwegian).  Both times I got a mobile pass for all flights.  On my return trip home, I had a four leg trip: three legs with SAS and the last one with United.  I couldn't get a mobile pass for any of the SAS flights but I got one for the United flight.  This year, I traveled to the US on WestJet and I was able to get a mobile pass for both legs of the trip, including the trip to the US, which confused me a little.  What's the reasoning for this?  I'm going to travel overseas again this summer and I was wondering what the criteria are for getting a mobile boarding pass and if the policies vary from airline to airline.  I know people who have had mobile passes for international flights before and I prefer them over paper tickets as it's one less item to remember to hold on to (I forgot my paper ticket on a flight last year because I was in a hurry and I'm so used to mobile passes).  Can anyone try to explain why sometimes I'm ineligible for a mobile pass?"

128,Need advice for changed itinerary by United (17 hours of layover added),1,9h9cse,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9h9cse/need_advice_for_changed_itinerary_by_united_17/,14,2018-09-20 01:40:04,"Hi all,

**tl;dr** United rebooked my confirmed award flight and added >17 hours of layover where they were very decent layovers before. They say they can't do anything but refund me or let me live with it even though I booked months ago. Any help?

If there's a better place to post this please let me know.

I recently booked a Awards flight with United after saving >400k miles over the past few years. It was a round trip flight to Sydney from Europe for 2 adults flying First Class one way and Business back (they were the First Class Saver the Business Saver awards). I found the dates at a great time, leaving just after Christmas, getting in Sydney for New Years, and coming back a few weeks later.

I logged into my United account today and saw ""Your itinerary has changed"" and assumed there's a slightly later take off time. I didn't get an email that I can find about this.

Original Flight: Total time ~24 hours
* Europe -> FRA; 1.5 hour layover
* FRA -> BKK; 1 hour layover
* BKK -> SYD

was changed to: Total time ~34 hours
* Europe -> FRA; 1.5 hour layover
* FRA -> BKK; 11.5 hour layover
* BKK -> SYD

So ~10.5 hours of layover were added. I checked the flight back, and the SYD -> BKK moved from afternoon to morning and they added another big layover.

Original:
* SYD -> BKK; 3.5 hour layover
* BKK -> VIE; 1.5 hour layover
* VIE -> Europe

New:
* SYD -> BKK; 10 hour layover
* BKK -> VIE; 1.5 hour layover
* VIE -> Europe

So ~6.5 hours of layover were added.

So I understand these things happen, but when I called them they told me that they can't find any flights at all on the way to SYD that would avoid the layover and they offered to fly me around the other side of the world for the way back saving me like 3 hours total. Keep in mind, I found >5 flights that were also Star Alliance (original flights were mostly Thai Airlines) and I found them through the United online search. Those flights stopped in a few different layover spots that would get me to SYD in a reasonable amount of time. 

Does anyone know how to approach this? Do I have any leverage here? We saved miles up forever and booked this flight at really decent times (even with the double layover) and they arbitrarily re-booked it to cost us almost a day of vacation (including bumping up my return flight from afternoon to morning).

They keep saying that there are no business saver awards flights available to switch to, but I booked a ticket, the original flight may have disappeared (I think the partner airline discontinued the flight) but I had a really decent booking and I'm pretty annoyed with the insane addition of time. I'd be expecting them to find me a Business Everyday Award or whatever, or be somewhat accommodating but it's mostly just apologizing and telling me their hands are tied.

I've pointed out all the alternative flights I found and they keep telling me ""they don't have the award tickets available in the system"".

The most they've offered is to refund the points and taxes, which is fine I guess, but I've had a whole vacation planned since June.

Has anyone been in this situation and had a positive outcome? I know the award points always have a bunch of stipulations, but I had a confirmed ticket, this just feels like a scam."

I agree about the service 100%. But the price thing? Nope. Since I just bought a ticket today I thought I'd share the difference in price.

AMS-EWR, 4-10 May.

As usual, Momondo found the cheapest price: http://imgur.com/j8VLIWO - UA 71/70 nonstop for €371 via budgetair.nl, which I've used several times before with good results - http://imgur.com/kuIPi9T 

I bought this ticket and it's confirmed with a ticket number verified on united.com.

Skyscanner found the same flight as a Lufthansa codeshare for €412 with a different discounter, but didn't find the €371 one. - http://imgur.com/1b14kgG

Hipmunk, which basically just gives you the same crap as Expedia/Travelocity, offers it for €748 - http://imgur.com/ZzYA727

And guess what? That's the same price that United themselves is selling it for in this market - http://imgur.com/vmDfLW0

And if you tell United you're in the USA, they want $812 for it, which is a €4 savings - http://imgur.com/UmkLAo9

tl;dr: the ticket was exactly half the price through a discounter, which is consistent with my experience in the past. It is definitely worth checking out these other agencies if the price tag matters."

132,I just flew Spirit airlines and it was the best flight of my life. Highly recommend.,4,68gau3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/68gau3/i_just_flew_spirit_airlines_and_it_was_the_best/,14,2017-04-30 20:24:46,"I booked a 2 way flight out of DC to Tampa for me and my family. The flight there was with United, and back was with Spirit. Ive never flown Spirit, but have heard the bad stories. So I was very cautious and mentally prepared myself for some BS on the way back. Boy was I wrong.

Price- Short and simple, its ridiculously cheap. For 3 people I paid $180 for the flight back (thats with seat reservations)

""Extra Fees""- Spirit makes it very easy and simple and telling you what will cost extra. They send emails, notifications, and go over it on the website. In order to get ""surprised"" with anything, you literally have to ignore the dozen times they shove in your face the things that will cost more.

Luggage fees- They let you bring one personal item for free. My wife had a big bag, and I had a bookbag. Both of these were free. If we had a large suitcase we could have checked it in for $40 I believe, but we did not. We also had a stroller which was free as well.

Customer Service- Both the people at the gate and attendants where polite, clean, well dressed, and helpful. No problems there.

Plane Comfort/Appearance/Cleanliness- This was the biggest surprise for me. The plane I flew on with Spirit was amazing. Due to having no fat reclining seats (as if that extra 2 inch tilt of the seat makes a difference) there was so much room! Im talking the isle was wider, the leg room was more, it felt so ""open"" compared to anything I've flown before. The cabin was clean, well lit, and there was a lot of open seats so you could move around without any issues. Ive flown United both with Wifi entertainment, TV's in the seats, American Airlines, etc, and this was honestly the most comfortable plane simply because it was so roomie and open. It felts like the cabin was a lot bigger than other planes.

Refreshments- Yes, they are not free. And maybe if you are flying 6-8 hours that could be an issue. But our flight was 2 hours, and we had snacks and a drink we purchased at the airport with us so that was no issue. They came around with a large variety of food and drinks and I got myself some hard lemonade which was great.

Overall I would highly recommend flying Spirit. Ive heard a story where are girl had to pay for luggage, and the flight ended up having a layover and she had to pay again at the layover. That seems ridiculous and maybe someone screwed up. Other than that I have not heard any valid points as to why they are a ""bad"" airline because of their extra fees, since they go over it very clearly.

Anyway, just thought I would let you guys know. Enjoy!"

I was researching flights and a one way flight home would cost $3,500, but I could buy a round trip flight for the same day for $232 and the return flight would be about $239, so overall it would be a lot less than buying a one way. My question is, how would the airline feel about me not taking that return flight? Could I pay an extra $100 for a flexible ticket and then cancel the return flight? Any advice about this would be helpful.

Also, I know I could buy through another airline, but I would prefer to fly United. However, I will be using another airline if this is not possible.

135,Two cancelled United flights in one night - does anyone know what compensation we would be entitled to/could demand?,3,6xt9l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6xt9l3/two_cancelled_united_flights_in_one_night_does/,13,2017-09-03 17:57:31,"tl/dr  
First 10pm flight from Newark to London Heathrow was cancelled due to a fault, as was the second 6 hours later.  Finally got to a hotel at about 9:15.  Finally got a flight out from JFK with a different airline nearly 24 hours after the first was due to leave.   

Long story:   

* 10:30pm United Flight departed gate on time: 10.30pm.   
* Taxied onto runway and sat still. Approximately 11pm, told technical fault. Towed back to gate to investigate.   
* Problem not able to be fixed. Told another aircraft would be available shortly. Disembarked approx. 11.30pm.   
* Gate information suggested departure at 12.30am. Subsequently moved to 1.30am, 2.30am and 3am. * Occasional updates suggesting food transfer to new flight was a problem due to ‘configuration’ of aircraft.   
* Given $15 of food vouchers on boarding card, however, no food outlets open. Used on chips, chocolate, bottled drinks as this was only option.   
* Boarded second flight at approx.. 3am. On runway at 3.30pm. Told we were being moved from gate to meet departure slot but paperwork was being completed.  
  
* Shortly after told another technical fault with fuel pump. Towed back to gate to check problem. Could not be resolved. Ground staff informed us there would be a flight put on at 6pm for passengers affected.   
* Disembarked at approx.. 4am and ushered to customer service desk. ONE staff member available for quite some time until several customers complained.      
* Waited for 2 hours to be allocated a hotel and onward flight (and we were quite near the front of the line)– Virgin from JFK at 6.45pm – NOT United flight promised. No additional refreshments offered. Nobody knew what was happening.   
* Given flight, hotel room until 1pm, $30 each of food vouchers, voucher for taxi to JFK.   
* Told to collect baggage as needed to be taken with us due to airport change.   
* Took baggage vouchers to reclaim at 6.15am. Told could wait up to an hour as baggage had to be located.   
* Enquired several times and told ‘it’s a long process’. At approx.. 8am, all baggage from flight was unloaded after insistence of speaking to a manager and being told ‘it wouldn’t make any difference’ and refused.   
* Bags collected approx. 8.30am.   
* Shuttle taken to hotel and checked in approx.. 9.15am.   
* Had 3 hours of sleep. Checked out due to need to travel to JFK. Used $30 of vouchers at hotel to buy food.
* Shuttle back to airport and then found cab to JFK.   
* Arrived at JFK at approx.. 3.30pm and checked into Virgin flight.   
* Tried to used remainder of food vouchers but told only valid at Newark by customer services.  Therefore purchased own food and drink.   
* Virgin flight left early and arrived early.   
* Arrived back in UK approx. 20 hours late.   
   
The whole incident was a complete shambles - very little communication, and what little we had seemed dubious.  The customer service agents left to deal with the mess after the flight crew departed were not filled in on the situation and the extra 6pm flight promised by the ground crew did not exist.   
   
What I'm looking for is some kind of idea what compensation we would be entitled to or could reasonably demand.  If this were an EU airline, or a flight within the EU we would be entitled to several hundred GBP in compensation and a refund on our tickets, but I can't find any laws implying that is the case for US airlines.  I'm thinking the bare minimum we should be entitled to is a full refund on the flight plus our out of pocket expenses.

The interrogation started with the usual ""where are you from"" and ""what is your business in the US"". He couldn't believe that I was visiting Chicago for university matters (although I shown him my university badge and emails confirming the story when he asked for proves), and continued with whom I was living in my house or whom I was seeing, to what and where I had for breakfast that morning and asking to describe in detail all interactions I had during the day until that moment.

The whole interaction looked to me plain harassment, but I did everything I could to comply and prove that I was not hiding anything. Now...

I was thinking going to New York City as there is always something to do there.  We are currently in the S.E. United States.

We would like to keep the costs reasonable.  We both enjoy tech stuff, aviation, good museums and natural attractions.  My brother bikes a lot and I doubt I could keep up with him but would be open to go to someplace with good biking.

140,United change fees sure make zero sense when changing to a cheaper flight.,3,2xvo2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2xvo2j/united_change_fees_sure_make_zero_sense_when/,13,2015-03-04 08:46:59,"I'll try to be brief, since I'm sure you all see this type of thing a lot.  But I'm bad at that.

Bought two one-way tickets on United via credit card points.  Cost of each ticket was $234 at the time.  Got the wrong dates from my travel partner.  Ugh.

Chase can reschedule for a $200 charge per ticket.  United would charge me $250 per ticket to cancel.  Neither option makes any sense, since my replacement flight is only $132.  I talked to multiple CSRs and supervisors, hoping for an exception due to the pricing difference.  I was willing to pay $234 for a $132 flight and call it even.  While they agreed with my logic and thought this particular situation was silly, they all chose to stick to the policy.

It gets more interesting.  My original flight is nearly sold out.  Ticket price has increased from the $234 I paid to $615 currently.  If only passengers could resell their tickets!

If United had accepted my offer, which was an even no-fee swap, I would effectively be paying about $100 extra per ticket for the new flight, and I'd be opening up two seats that could each net them $615 instead of the $234 I paid.

Putting it another way, I have now paid a total of $732 for 4 flights (plus one bag), two of which I'm not going to use.  My seats will fly empty, unless they've overbooked.  They could have accepted $468 from me, plus $1230 (plus additional bags, etc.) from other passengers for the same 4 tickets.

I get the change policies and associated fees.  They have to plan their routes and pricing and they don't want you to cancel at the last minute.  They want to make money.  That's fine.  I made a mistake.  That's fine.  But in this particular case, they've given up at least $1,000 in additional fares by sticking to the policy.  If I want to switch to a different flight on *your* airline, and my new flight costs less than the old flight *and* less than the change fee, then why would anyone pay the change fee?  And if the fare difference alone in your favor is nearly twice the cost of the change fee...*change my flight for free and sell my tickets to someone else.*  This is basic math, people.

I'm sorry.  I've been ranting about this for weeks now.  I was just reminded when I got an email today to ""check out the available seat upgrades"" for my original flight (for which economy seats are sold out).  So, I apologize for making you read through it all.

tl;dr:  I booked the wrong flights.  When I tried to fix it, United turned down $1230 in favor of demanding $400 in fees; but in the end, they'll only get $264.  My mistake cost me $468, but their mistake cost them $966, plus some respect from customers who can math."
141,Flying United Airlines 747? Remember to bring a book.,0,5343x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5343x6/flying_united_airlines_747_remember_to_bring_a/,13,2016-09-17 01:03:51,"I helped my father book a flight from China. He flew on United 858 from Shanghai to San Francisco. United 858 flew 747-400 which is fine. I flew on 747-400 with China Airlines, EVA airlines and some other airlines all the time. I don't have a problem with flying on older planes.

However, on the United Airline flight, there was no personal screen or TV for economy...I couldn't believe it when I heard it.  This is 2016.. What was even worse was that the communal TV didn't have any sound *(Edit) as the system was broken. I flew economy class on China or Eva Airlines 747 and they had personal TV/screen 10 years ago. 12 hours flight with no entertainment. It must have been agonizing for him. 

I couldn't believe United Airlines amenity is this bad. It is one thing if this was a low cost airline but they are not. I felt really bad for my father. Just wanted to let me fellow travelers know. "

But most airlines don't write anything about how big or heavy this item can be!

The few airlines that do specify a size for the personal item (ryanair, united) usually say around 40cm x 20cm, others just say  ""a hand bag, camera bag etc."" or some simply say ""it must fit under the seat in front"".

&#x200B;

So is there any general rule of thumb to apply on this? When it says hand bag, would a small school sized backpack that fits under the seat be ok? I don't get why the style of the bag should be relevant....

&#x200B;

Lastly, I've also read that you can always take a pillow or blanket in your hand onto a flight, which for me is important as I always have back pain when flying. But is this true, even if it is not specifically written? Or would this then be considered your personal item even though it will not go under the seat?

Some advice from experienced travelers would be greatly appreciated!

The situation: I work in London, but have been invited to interview for a couple of PhD positions in California. The interviews are a couple of weeks apart, so I can’t batch them into one trip (and I’m not allowed to take more than four consecutive days off from work anyway). As a result, I’ll be making two rapid-fire trips from London to California and back (2.5 days on the ground for the first, 1.5 days for the second). I’ve never flown so far before, so I’m quite nervous.

Complications: I need to be performing as highly as possible for the interviews of course, and fully functioning at work the morning after I get back from each trip. (Otherwise it counts as taking additional unapproved holiday time.) These two trips take up all of my accrued holiday, and my company can’t know about these interviews, so I’m not able to extend either trip. The universities will only pay for the basic economy fare, and I’m just not able to cover the increase in fare for premium economy myself (+£1100/$1500 for the first trip alone), so I’m stuck in coach. I’m worried about space as I am fairly tall (5’11”). The economy luggage allowance is only 8kg. Oh, and I’ve never been able to sleep on planes, not even with heavy-grade sleeping medication. 

(I’m not entirely sure who my first flight is with. I booked it through Austrian, after booking they said it was actually operated by United, and it has a Lufthansa flight number. I plan to call Austrian this weekend to see if I can confirm the underlying airline and get their booking code, and then see if I can upgrade to an exit seat or something.)

So my question is... is this manageable? Or am I a wee bit screwed? 

Specifically:

1. How do I manage such long and densely distributed flights?
2. Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of being alert at the interviews and at work after?
3. Any advice on keeping my luggage under the 8kg? I plan to wear my interview shoes on the plane. 
4. Has anyone else balanced international interviews with a high-pressure job? How did it go?

Thank you!!

Tl;dr: I have two weekend interview trips from London to California, and I haven’t flown that far before. What do I do?"

The problem is that she did not tell me  which airline it was for. I'm skeptical that she would both remember and be willing to tell me at this point, if I could even contact her. I did pay her for the ticket, so it would be nice to recoup the costs.

Is there a way to determine which airline it is for? It has 5 letters and no numbers.

The original ticket was from MT to Boston, MA with 2 layovers, if that narrows down which airlines could have provided that.

I've checked the most popular airlines, but they all seem to use 6-digit confirmation codes. The exhaustive list of airlines, accounting for connections at different major airports, is, well, exhausting.

TLDR: is there a way to tell which airline a confirmation code is for?

Update: I contacted a couple of airlines and was able to get the confirmation code from the cancelation. It was with United, and I was missing the last character from the code. Thanks for the advice, fellow travelers!"

All of the travelling I have done in my life has been via car.

This summer I will be going to Oahu for my honeymoon and am nervous about booking flights and I am intimidated by the airports.

My questions are as follows:

Is it reliable to book flight + hotel through expedia? Never used them before. Do they send you the airline tickets and hotel confirmation?

How do ""stop"" flights work? One flight I was looking at goes from Oahu to San Francisco and then a 32 minute gap until the flight takes off again. Would I have to get off the one plane and all my stuff and go to another plane or is it usually the same plane? How would I work if I had a checked bag? Would the airline (United) transfer all the luggage or would that be my responsibility? 

I would be flying out of Newark airport and have never been there before. Is it confusing and hard to navigate? If I had a 7:00 am flight, what time would be best to get there?"

I already have about 25K miles with United and haven’t honestly been tracking the others (maybe 4-6 short trips with Delta in the past few months). Which airline should I stick with going forward to accrue miles? My brother suggested United - he’s close to a million miles with them, and his wife is the same with Virgin which is definitely nicer but has downsides (less flights and less flight flexibility).

TL;DR best way to get compensation for delayed-for-maintenance flights on 3 separate airlines.

Long Story:

Not to say that someone else hasn’t had worse luck and worse flight delays, but my most recent trip was chalk full of delays on different airlines and while I’m totally fine now that I’m home, I’m still annoyed. I’m looking for advice on the best way to get reimbursement from each airline. Currently, I am planning on just going through each airline’s customer service phone line, but if there’s any other recommendations for what I should do, I’d love to hear them.

All of this flying is in the US

Flight 1: just me affected, delta airlines, got on flight, engine wouldn’t start, deplaned after an hour, flight delayed a total of 3ish hours, normal connecting flight would have been missed so they rebooked me to a different airport where I eventually made it to my destination 5 hours after us should have, 5 hours of work missed, somewhat important meeting missed.

Flight 2: my in-laws flight was delayed/cancelled(not sure) due to maintenance, American Airlines, AA rebooked them on a later flight causing them to miss a paint and sip class that I paid for, in-laws have no interest in paying me back but (if it’s easy enough) they’ll go through the reimbursement process for the paint class and give me the reimbursement, I know it’s only $60 but I’d rather not eat that

Flight 3: return trip home for me and wife, United Airlines, flight delayed due to maintenance (incoming flight landed but there was an issue so they lazily (yes I’m most upset about this flight) went and grabbed another plane from the hangar), flight was delayed about 1hr and 15min which essentially ate up all of our layover time at the next airport and we ran about a mile (not exaggerating) through the airport and made it to our connecting flight literally as the gate agent was walking away to shut the door, the whole plane waited just for us which was really nice but if we would have been 30 seconds later the doors would have been closed. Yes we made this connecting flight but I’m pissed about me and my wife having to run through the airport to barely make the flight

So 3 different airlines, 3 different situations, what’s my best options here? Thanks in advance for the suggestions.

Side note on Flight 1: Delta overbooked the flight by 2 people and offered 2 $800 dollar Amazon gift cards for people to take a later flight, guess who wasn’t smart enough to take that offer? Me and 100 other people :("

I lost my dad suddenly to a heart attack at the end of July at the age of 63 (we were supposed to go to EAA Airventure the weekend following his death), and then at the very end of August, my wife who was pregnant with twins (due in December), gave birth to our first two children (over 3 months prematurely).  Faye, our firstborn daughter arrived just before midnight on August 31st and lived only 17 hours, while Brian, born just after midnight on September 1st (yes Labor Day), has been hanging in there, living in a NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit - at the hospital).  Being so premature requires a lot of medical help!  We expect him to be in the hospital until late this year or early next year.  How does this relate to travel?  As the title says, I simply cannot get United Airlines to budge on their no refund policy (on non-refundable tickets).  We had two trips planned, one wedding in Washington (flight was to Portland, OR) and one extended family trip to Florida, that our doctor recommended we not go on since of the higher risk with carrying twins.  I have been trying since my wife and I learned we had twins on the way to get my United Airlines tickets refunded (well over a month before either trip), and still cannot get a refund...

A couple of things worth noting about my experiences during this time with other travel companies:

1. I used Hotwire to book a couple hotel nights in Wisconsin for the Airventure trip.  I called them and told them the situation of my dad passing and they refunded me immediately.  This is certainly an exception to their normal policy of no refunds.
THANK YOU HOTWIRE!

2. I had purchased a Travelzoo voucher for a hotel night and museum visit in Springfield, IL (relatively near where we live).  I was planning this for our 5th wedding anniversary and when I told Travelzoo our situation with a baby in the hospital and one passing, they refunded me immediately after talking with a supervisor.  This again is certainly an exception to another company's normal policy of no refunds.

The following was submitted to http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/Contact/customer/default.aspx on September 26th, 2014:

To whom it may concern in United Airlines Customer Care,

I have been trying to work with United Airlines to get my tickets refunded for some time now (months).  I have used the United website multiple times (cancelling the tickets and submitting refund requests), submitting and resubmitting requests, and called probably more than half a dozen times (I tried just now and gave up as it would be 20-25 minutes of waiting) with very little to no progress.  Originally, I was requesting a refund as my wife was pregnant with twins, which was not an appropriate reason for a refund I was told.  We provided a signed doctor's note telling us not to fly and requested all the flights listed below be refunded.  I was told we could rebook our flights for next year, once the twins had been born.  This was my only option at that time.

Our situation has changed again.  Our twins that were due in December, were born August 31st/Sept 1st.  Our daughter, Faye, passed away just 17 hours into life, and our son, Brian has been struggling through life and is doing relatively well considering his prematurity.  Assuming Brian continues to do well, we will very likely be in the hospital until January 2015 or later.  I again ask that United refund me the full amount of my tickets and not give me the round-about and require me to rebook a different flight early next year.  We will very likely be unable to travel with Brian for a while (depending on his medical needs).  I just ask that United Airlines please treat me and my family as people, and try to understand my situation in the slightest.

Here are the refund request numbers and ticket numbers in full:
M24G06 -> Oregon - $696 (2 tickets)
Ticket 1 (Carl) - Ticket #
Ticket 2 (Lauren) - Ticket #
PGDMST -> Florida - $602 (2 tickets)
Ticket 1 (Carl) - Ticket #
Ticket 2 (Lauren) - Ticket #
Total Refund Requested - $1298

Here is what I received from United Airlines yesterday (October 14th, 2014):

Thank you for contacting Customer Refund Services regarding the above referenced ticket.

The ticket you are inquiring about is non-refundable; therefore, we cannot issue a refund. The ticket is valid for one year from the date of issue, and may be used toward the purchase of another United Airlines ticket. If the fare of the new ticket is higher than that of the original, you will be charged the additional amount, plus the applicable reissue fee when the new ticket is issued. The reservation must be canceled or reissued before the scheduled day of travel. If this reservation has not been canceled or to make a new reservation, please call 1-800-525-0280 or visit our website at www.United.com.

Please help Reddit!  I don't think it's unreasonable to be refunded in such a circumstance (as shown by Hotwire and Travelzoo), but apparently United Airlines feels it more important to strictly adhere to a policy than to treat their customers as people.

Update: United refunded all but 50 dollars from all 4 flights (200 dollars total)!  I am relatively satisfied, but I do find it a bit unusual that they didn't just do the whole amount.  I'm done dealing with them though.  Thank you for all your tips and encouragement!  Never give up!"

Unfortunately as we got there we had the opportunity to watch our flight take off early. So after waiting in line for several hours we were able to get our next flight with an arrival time around 9 am something like 16 hours later than our original arrival time... Just in time to be an hour late to the rehearsal going on a couple hours of sleep, 0 compensation and nobody can do anything better for us. I guess just shit luck. 

Fast forward to November of 2014, me and my fiancé going to Italy via United. Wonderful vacation we had an amazing time, $1400 usd a person just for airline tickets, worth every penny until our flight home.... So we get to the Florence airport a little late but easily make our flight, a little stressful but we're happy, we land for our layover in Germany and we both get the random screening in the back along with 2 dozen or so other people from the same flight, not even half the people have gone in the back and our flight is supposed to be boarding, the plane is held for us and we leave for our next lay over in San Francisco a little late it's about a 15-16 hour flight and they were able to make up lost time and get us there on time, and wouldn't you know it we get to our gate and then our flight to Portland is cancelled.... We again stand in line for 3 hours to talk to customer service again they claim they can't do anything for us(also are extremely rude and don't answer our questions)try getting us on flights but we can't get anything, we were but on standby an only third in line, that seems like a decent chance of getting something? Nope, because for some reason an hour later we are bumped to 14th, wtf? Go back to stand in line for an hour oh we aren't gold members or some bullshit so others have priority. We have now been in San Francisco airport for 16 hours and the best they can get us is a flight with yet another layover in Seattle with our final arrival time in Portland at 4 pm, 21 hours later than our original arrival time... Again not offering us any compensation we had to buy 40 dollars worth of shitty airport food for dinner and breakfast I end up missing out on a day and a half of work. She goes to school at WSU and this caused her to miss her train which was a $40 ticket, she also missed two nights of work, and two days of classes, and WSU is not very cheap for us. 

TLDR: United airlines turned a 6 hour trip into 22 hour trip and a 21 hour trip into a 44 hour trip with 0 compensation

161,United Airlines wants to charge me $200 to relinquish a seat.,4,221tko,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/221tko/united_airlines_wants_to_charge_me_200_to/,12,2014-04-03 02:00:52,"Back in January I booked a round trip flight on United Airlines from Seattle to Greensboro, NC for a friend's wedding which is happening April 12th. I decided to fly on the 10th and take a couple days of vacation.

This week I find out I need to fly to NYC for work, which will directly lead up to my planned vacation. No problem says my boss, why don't you fly directly to North Carolina from New York and then hop on your original flight home. Sounds great to me, I can avoid flying back and forth across the country needlessly.

I call United Airlines to let them know I won't be needing the outgoing leg of the flight. I understand it's a non-refundable ticket so I don't expect any money back, but I thought it was the right thing to do, plus *maybe* I thought I would get some credit for a future flight.

The reservation agent informs me that they will charge me $200 to ""change my ticket."" I'm confused, I tell her, I need to pay you to give back the seat? ""Yes"" she says, there are ""operational costs"" that United incurs to resell the seat.

Ok, I say, that doesn't seem logical, but if that's the case, wouldn't it be in my best interest to simply *not* show up for the flight? This is when she informs me that if I do that, I will be marked as ""no-show"" and it will void my return ticket. Asked to talk to a supervisor, she said the same thing.

What the hell United? You're telling me it's going to cost me MORE money to take one flight instead of two?

I get that this is probably all in the fine print of my ticket agreement, but it just seems really mean spirited.

162,Am I the only one here that has never had a problem with United?,1,3k9ynx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3k9ynx/am_i_the_only_one_here_that_has_never_had_a/,12,2015-09-09 22:24:26,"Type ""United"" into the search bar and the only thing you'll find are posts complaining about bad experiences with them, one going as far as calling them ""Comcast of the Sky"". This comes as a surprise to me seeing as I fly with them several times a year and have always had pleasant experiences. (Well, not pleasant, but no worse than any other US Airline.) 

My home airport is Dayton so going pretty much anywhere requires a connection in Chicago; a major airport for all three big airlines. (United and American in particular.) The two places I go every year are Gunnison/Crested Butte (via Denver) in the winter and Los Angeles in the spring, in addition to other places I may go once every few years. Going to Colorado is always on United and is almost always a breeze. The only time I ever had a problem was when my ORD-DEN flight was delayed by mechanical trouble and I ended up missing my connecting flight. However, upon my arrival in Denver we were met at the gate by a United representative who informed us that we had already been re-booked on the next flight and presented us with a voucher for a free night at a hotel near the airport as well as a $10 meal ticket for each of us.

 Going to Los Angeles in the spring usually involves flying either AA or Delta. Delta has been fine for the most part but flying on American more often than not becomes a complete pain in the ass. I don't think I've ever been on a AA flight out of O'Hare that wasn't delayed and their customer service completely sucks too. On my most recent trip, I flew from Burbank-Phoenix-Chicago-Dayton. In Phoenix, our flight was delayed an hour and-a-half. (Through no fault of AA, apparently someone threw up on the last flight and they had to vacuum the carpets or something.)   By the time we finally boarded, it became clear we were going to miss our flight to Dayton and would have to spend the night in Chicago. Upon landing, I expected a similar procedure as with United in Denver but coming out of the jet-bridge there was no one to be seen. Not even at the gate desk. We had to find our way to a re-booking kiosk and the seemingly thoroughly uninterested rep. on the other side took 30 minutes to get us onto the flight the next day and was ready to hang up before I asked about overnight accommodations. She curtly informed us that she couldn't do anything and we would have to go find a Customer Service staff member inside the airport. It was late at night, so there was no one at the dedicated customer service and most of the gates were empty too. We finally found two gate agents who were stuck there because the flight that was coming into their gate was delayed. (surprise!) We marched up and pretty much demanded that we be put up in a hotel and the agent, who to her credit was very polite and professional, said that she would need to phone her supervisor to approve. He pretty much just said ""yeah whatever, just give it to them"" and we were finally on our way to the hotel. (Whose bus took 45 minutes to pick us up.) 

During the ride, I thought back to people we had met at the re-booking kiosk who had also missed their Dayton flight. They struck me as the type that rarely flew and looked very unsure as to their best course of action. They were at the kiosk when we got there and were still trying to negotiate with the rep. on the phone when we left. I hoped that they too had managed to get into a hotel but thought it was more likely that AA just let them spend the night in the airport.

TL;DR I've never had a bad experience with United, and if you're ever departing from/transferring through O'Hare don't choose American Airlines."

So their bags were transported via the Delta flight, but they were denied entry. They went back to United who gave them compensation of a $10 voucher to be used in the airport on that day only, and a flight to their destination 10 hours later. Is there anything they can do to receive better compensation?

They were able to find me a flight which departs at the same time but lands at JFK instead. I have accepted this option since it is important for me to be there tomorrow morning for the meeting.

I also have travel insurance which allows me GBP 5000 in UK expenses cover and GBP 10,000,000 in 'Medical and other expenses outside of the United Kingdom Emergency dental treatment' cover. A direct link to the policy wording is available here (I have the emerald cover): http://www.coverforyou.com/content/policywording-cfu-direct.pdf 


I have three queries now which are related to travel compensation

1. Initially I was supposed to take a taxi from Newark to the hotel which would have cost me USD 60-70. From JFK, it'll cost me USD 250-300. I'm landing quite late so other public transport unfortunately won't be an option. Is there a way for me to get this compensation from the airline or from the insurance company?

2. I had to call the airline for 30 mins on a number which wasn't toll free. I don't know how much it'll cost but it's an extra costs which was added for me due to the flight cancellation. Any ways to claim that here? 

3. Am I eligible for any airline compensation due to the flight cancellation (personally, I don't think so but checking just in case)

Thank you."
169,Are US-based airlines of lower quality?

For instance, United charges for entertainment (around 6 dollars) and alcohol (5 dollar beers) and just offers a shitty sandwich on a 6 hour flight (EWR-BOG). A national flight within Colombia (1 hour) had better service and free entertainment. A 6 hour flight in Air Canada (BOG-YYZ) offers free entertainment, a complete hot meal with wine or beer (+ a snack at the end) and in general much better service, while being comparable in price to United. Lufthansa is a class of its own, I have to say. 

I travel frequently from Canada to Colombia and I avoid connecting through the US (unless I can get Air Canada+Avianca) for this reason

Are my experiences the exception? or do you agree that service and quality in US-based airlines is lower than in others? Any ideas on why this is the case?"

They said to just get to the airport extra early and discuss with the United staff at airport.

I would like to think that most people will realize that “Alex” is the generally accepted shorted form of “Alexander” and that they won’t make a big deal about it. I’ll pay a fee to have the name fixed if that’s what it takes but I’m just worried they’ll be strict and not fix it no matter what.

Thing is, there's a bit more than 1h 30m between my flights and I'm not sure that's enough.

Is EWR really big, forcing me to run from one gate to another?

I don't have the gate numbers yet, since the flight is due in a ~month and there seems to be no gate specifier on the eTickets themselves.

Also- both flights are United. Does it mean the gates would probably be close? Does that mean that I won't have to pass through security again? Any gurrantees that given the airport and the airline I would be able to stay airside?

176,Carry-on luggage that is ACTUALLY compliant for traveling in the US (or International)?,0,6cmb13,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6cmb13/carryon_luggage_that_is_actually_compliant_for/,12,2017-05-22 13:50:16,"Hi all,

I have spent hours looking for a carry-on luggage that meets the 22"" x 14"" x 9"" requirements for most airlines. This itself isn't so hard to find, until you read the reviews and find out that the wheels and handles make it bigger, or for whatever reason the real measurements are not aligned with those advertised. It's incredibly frustrating that dimensions advertised are not the actual full external dimensions, and it's incredibly frustrating that companies make carry-ons that don't fit most airlines. 

Ideally, I'd like a teal or turquoise hardshell spinner/4 wheel (softshell is fine too, but I tend to overstuff my luggage so I thought a hardshell would be better for maximizing volume while setting a physical hard limit). Somewhere between 6-7lbs would be ideal. I want to maximize the carrying capacity while staying compliant (even if that means not using the expandable luggage features some bags have). 

I found this awesome luggage at Costco, but the dimensions advertised are way too big at 23.48x15.22x8.88(10?) (https://www.costco.com/Ricardo-Lombard-Hardside-Spinner-21%22-Carry-on.product.100328434.html). I'm thinking of going in and measuring it myself just to be sure. It also doesn't have a side handle, which isn't a deal breaker, but would be nice.

I found this article helpful, but it only lists two luggages that are compliant: http://www.consumerreports.org/luggage/When-carry-on-luggage-isnt-carry-on-size/

I've read that United's actual luggage containers allow an extra inch in every direction, but I know this isn't the case for other airlines. Which carry-ons do you guys use, and which do you recommend?

Thanks!

Edit: Some of the luggages I've been considering are listed below, but again I'm worried about the actual dimensions not matching the in-person dimensions. Also worried about warranty for some:

Wife (US Green card holder, Kazakhstan passport holder), Kid (US Citizen) traveling from the US to Kazakhstan via Baku for the first time.  


From what I read up on: My wife being a KZ citizen could enter Baku visa free, my kid could get a transit visa on arrival if needed. (But apparently this was only if flying from JFK for some reason)  


I had to book travel on 2 different sites for their United/Luftanasa tickets for travel from the US to Baku.

Then on a smaller KZ based airline site for their hop over the Caspian sea.  


When we got our tickets departing the US the computer flagged us down because my kid didn't have a visa for Baku. I had to explain to United (Multiple times) that Baku wasn't their final destination, they were merely transiting)  


I showed travel assistance their tickets for Baku to KZ on the other airline. At first the woman freaked out because they were printed in Russian. Once I showed here the English abbreviations also on the ticket she took the tickets and passports, disappeared for 15 minutes and had to talk it over with someone else.   


She came back saying they were clear to go but couldn't ship our bags because they didn't have a transfer agreement with the Kazak airline.  I'm like 'I'm not asking you to transfer the bags. They can pick up the bags in Baku'  


Her answer came back saying for them to pick up the bags in Baku they have to exit out of the transit area.  My wife would be allow to do that, but my kid doesn't have a visa (And can't get one upon arrival), and being a minor can't be left alone.

  
I asked if they could send the bags anyways. We could have a friend/family member meet them in Baku, watch the kid, wife gets the bags and comes back. Or the wife could talk to immigration there and get special permission and let Azerbaijan decide. Or worst case scenario ditch the bag in Baku if none of the above worked out.  


No dice from United.  I asked if it was a possible terrorist thing for us to leave possible unattended baggage in Baku.  


No. They came back with the answer that it was due to not having a baggage transfer agreement with the KZ airline. And it wasn't possible for wife/kid together to pick up the bags in Baku. They were fine to travel with just carry-ons but they couldn't send the baggage.

&#x200B;

So for the frequent international flyers of Reddit: Was this a valid reason by United to refuse to ship our bags? Or was the United agent power tripping or being lazy refusing to believe there could be different outcomes?"

From there I want to stay in SE Asia for at least another 3 months or so. Philippines would be the next country and I hear Indonesia is nice as well. I was thinking staying 1 month in each country to help on travel costs.

I'm not sure I want to go to Europe, Japan or Australia as I don't think they will be in my budget. I also am weary of staying in hostels as I like my privacy/private rooms and bathrooms. Please see notes and questions below.

Notes. Am I missing anything?
- I have a US passport
- All of my vaccinations are up to date besides yellow fever (won't be going to Vietnam)
- I only want to take a backpack with minimal gear and nothing flashy so that I don't draw attention to myself
- I'm a Hilton Honors Gold member so I can get a few free nights.
- I have status on United Airlines so I will be able to get a few free plane tickets.
- I do not have any visas whatsoever
- I'm leaving the week of July 28th
- I drink my fare share of alcohol and smoke cigarettes
- 26 years old. Probably doesn't matter
- I wouldn't be opposed to finding a wife while abroad

Questions:
- Do I have enough money to last me a year?
- What are the best places to visit in SE Asia?
- I'm half black/half white - will I have any race issues in certain areas?
- Can you build me an itinerary or link me to a past one?
- Should I book every single flight/hotel in advance to save $$?
- Are my expectations unrealistic given my budget and my requirement to have a private room?
- What are the most beautiful and inexpensive places to go to?"

Anyone done this?

Anyone have recent experience with international arrivals into ATL?

183,Noob travel question about carry-on bags - Is a backpack and a briefcase/messenger bag okay?,3,3gzob6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3gzob6/noob_travel_question_about_carryon_bags_is_a/,11,2015-08-14 20:11:26,"Hello, 

I know the FAQ says that one carry-on bag and one personal item are okay, but I'm curious if a backpack and a briefcase fit the bill, or will the airlines tell me no because they're both personal items?  I realize that this is probably a silly question but I haven't flown much and before I've just had the backpack only, so I'm a little paranoid. 

If it matters, the briefcase has a shoulder strap so it's really more of a smallish messenger bag (17"" in the longest dimension) and the backpack is ordinary.  Either one would fit under the seat.  It would be on a little Embraer reigonal jet (United/Expressjet), then a Boeing 777 and a Boeing 737 (both Air China).  "

The airline has rebooked us on flights to get us to our destination but we will get there about 24 hours later than planned. 

What should we ask for as far as compensation? We aren’t t really sure what they are required to do.  Thanks in advance for any help or advice.

UPDATE:
I just realized that I never updated this. All we did was go onto the Aer Lingus website, and there was a spot to submit a claim. We just put in some of the information from our flight and within a couple weeks, we heard back that they were going to give us the full 600 euro compensation each. About a week after that, we received a check and that was it. We never had to write a letter or talk to anybody. In one of their communications, they stated that this was a regulation that they had to follow. 

I would encourage anyone in the future in the situation to just reach out to the airlines. It was a much different experience then we have had dealing with other airlines in the United States."

I've flown with Singapore Airlines before and loved it, but they only seem to offer return flights, and not one-way (anyone know why this is?). Also flown with ANA. It'll be a long flight so it'd be nice if I didn't feel like dying during the flight. I'm fine with long flights (flew RDU to SG) and other >12 hour flights.

191,Western Europe Study/Travel/Exchange Questions and Advice,1,4nu2yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4nu2yd/western_europe_studytravelexchange_questions_and/,11,2016-06-13 08:40:32,"***Background***

Hello :)

I am a 20 (21 when travels begin) Australian student who is lucky enough to be spending 8 weeks in the UK (university-related project), 8 weeks travelling Europe, and then 6 months in Sweden on exchange. This all begins sometime in the week of 21st September 2016.

I’ve never travelled alone however, so as amazing as this trip is going to be, I would be extremely grateful if /r/travel could help me with advice, or just mentioning things I haven’t seemed to think about yet. The only downside so far is that I'll be in winter for a whole year it seems!

Thank you all in advance!


***Decisions I need to make and questions to be asked***

**How to Pack**

I’ve struggled with this question immensely. The problem boils down to going straight to exchange in January, and not returning to Australia after my UK time. It will be much easier to backpack across Europe, rather than lugging around a big suitcase, although the fact that I need to be semi-dressed up for the time in the UK already adds weight to my packing. Although I may need certain items while in Sweden, I’m thinking it’s just easier to have a box of the essentials shipped there after I begin, rather than carry it with me for 4 months. I don’t really know what backpack to get, but I’ve heard the Osprey Farpoint 40 is good, and shouldn’t be a problem to bring as carry-on.

**Laptop**

I think I HAVE to bring this if only for Sweden. I'm still using a “New Series 9” Samsung (2012) and I really wanted to get something faster (Surface Book?) but was too worried about getting it stolen.

**Phone/Camera**

I’m still using an iPhone 5s and was planning to upgrade to the iPhone 7 this September. The problem is that I don’t know if I’ll be able to source one before I leave, and I’m now less open to purchasing the 6s even after the price drop when the 7 comes out. I would be happy to keep the 5s, but I thought it would be a good way to upgrade my phone, and have a passable camera for my travels at the same time. The DSLR is too bulky, and I strongly considered buying a GoPro to go with my 5s, but I feel that if I could get an iPhone 7, it would solve both problems (and I’m less worried about having the iPhone stolen compared to the laptop).

**Packing Cubes**

Worth it? Just thought I’d get some opinions due to the limited space etc.

**Travel Apps**

Any suggestions?

**Flight Centre Travel Voucher**

I was lucky enough to win a travel voucher and was wondering what exactly I could purchase from them? Hoping to show them a quote for my flights and Eurail pass and get those at cost price without the markup.

***Potential Problems***

**Clearing UK Immigrations/Customs**

I’ve heard that travelling into a county without a return ticket booked is asking for trouble. I’m hoping the fact that I’ll have a Eurail pass and a letter from my University/the exchange University will mitigate that.

**Entrance/Exit Fees**

I can’t find anything about these for the UK or Schengen countries so hopefully I’m all good there.


***Current Plan***

**Travel Destinations**

26 September – 18 November: UK University Project (London, West-cliff on Sea, Lyme Regis, Liverpool). Flying from Sydney to London. Flying out from Manchester to (?)Spain.

Late November – Early January: Europe travel. Mostly Western Europe for the first time. Eurail pass ($866 for 15 days in 2 months). Intended countries (probably doing ~1 week each): Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Luxembourg/Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden.

January – June: Sweden exchange. Hoping to do more Scandinavian countries and Central/Eastern Europe while on exchange.

Ideally I’d keep things very flexible, but if I HAD to have an itinerary, it would be as follows:

* https://goo.gl/maps/95jQ6scXoxN2 (day trips while studying to Cambridge, Oxford etc)
* https://goo.gl/maps/uCa5gNugQbM2 
* https://goo.gl/maps/WdBqn7qTwRL2
* https://goo.gl/maps/QZPFJFgxfz42
* https://goo.gl/maps/MRcqQvpFChz
* https://goo.gl/maps/wPs7CakgK1D2

I would really love suggestions and criticisms here. I do think I’m being a little ambitious with how much I want to see, but I’d rather miss out on a few things, than run out things to see haha. What I’m most interested in is history, architecture, culture, sport, food… but really I just want to experience as much as possible. I’m not as huge on the nightclub/party scene etc, but I wouldn’t feel right not giving it a go at least.

**Accommodation**

Mostly hostels or AirBnb, depending on my mood. I’d love to meet as many new people as possible, and perhaps go on random spontaneous trips (hence the global Eurail pass), but at least during the UK studying period, I might do more AirBnbing just so I make sure I pass the unit!

I’m also hoping to do a bit of Couchsurfing. As far as I understand it, it’s a good way to meet locals and experience things from a local’s point of view, so you never know what hidden gems they may know about. I don’t have much of a Couchsurfing rep, nor have had the ability to host anyone, so I’m not expecting to spend large amount of time Couchsurfing.

I’ll be in student accommodation for the Sweden exchange hopefully.

***Logistical things I need to consider***

**Flights**

Seeing as I won’t be returning to Australia for about 10 months, and most flight deals are for return journeys, I was wondering what a good price for a one-way ticket to London from Sydney is? The cheapest I’ve been able to track down in the week I need to depart is $680 AUD flying with Philippine Airlines via Manila. I have the option of a 1 hour layover or 20 hours and I wouldn’t mind fitting exploring Manila for a day, though I’ve also heard it’s not really worth it so I’d love to hear some more opinions (including whether PA is a good carrier, Malaysia Airlines is next cheapest $859 1 way). 

**Visa**

As far as I am aware, I don’t need a visa for the UK or Europe (Schengen) with my Australian Passport. I’m not studying formally with any education institution, and for the most part I’m a tourist until I make it to Sweden for exchange. Please correct me if I am mistaken!

**Phone**

If anyone can find a better option for me regarding data etc while in Europe, please let me know, otherwise I’m looking at: http://store.three.co.uk/view/searchSimOnly?tariff=213090100 

**International Power Adapter**

I’ll probably need to get some kind of international power adapter right? From what I can tell, Europe and Australia both use 220-240 volts, but do I need a specific adapter for the prongs?

**Transportation**

I’m mainly going to rely on the Eurail pass to get me over large distances. Perhaps 15 days in 2 months is too much for me, if I want to take lots of small trips and get to more than just the big cities (i.e. countryside and villages). I’d like to drive for bits and pieces, perhaps go on a road trip with new friends. Opinions here are much appreciated.

**Money**

Currently in the process of getting a 28 Degrees MasterCard and a Citibank Plus Everyday Account (fee-free transactions and currency exchange with no annual fee)

**Immunisations**

Shouldn’t be too much of a worry where I’m going. Will just visit the GP regardless.

**International Drivers Licence**

Probably a good idea in case I feel the itch to drive

**International Student Identity Card**

Worth it at all?

I… didn’t expect there to be so much text in the post, and I’m really sorry about that! I hope it shows that I have done a bit of research so that I’m not just asking internet strangers to do all the work for me. Thank you so much if you are able to help, or even if you read down all the way to here!

Warmest Wishes,

JC"

I grew up in Las Vegas. The furthest east I have ever lived is Idaho. But after going on a Caribbean cruise in May 2013, I wanted to travel. It's all I thought about. I spent all my spare time reading about places I could visit (you all know what I was going through, I'm sure). I've always been interested in history and other cultures, and the travel really kickstarted my hunger.

So then I am browsing on reddit and I see [this post about Slovenia](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1wgr3e/so_you_want_to_come_to_slovenia_2_dogs_1_bear/). To be honest, I had no idea where Slovenia was, what it looked like, etc. Outside of the winter olympics, I had never heard of it. but it was beautiful in the photos. I realized how much I am missing. Utah is beautiful. Oregon is beautiful. But there was an entire globe I was missing out on. I read about living in Slovenia. It sounded like a place I could see myself living. 

So I started looking for jobs overseas. I looked for legal jobs in Australia and the USVI, but couldn't find anything I liked. Eventually, I stumbled on the US Foreign Service (AKA being an American Diplomat). The process was hard (acceptance rate is comparable to Harvard) and I didn't have a lot of experience, but I didn't have any kids (married) and wanted to travel while I was still young. 

Well, as of last week, I've passed every step required. My career should be starting in March. I have enjoyed my 15 or so months as a lawyer, but I can't wait to get out and meet people and speak to them in their own languages. I'll get a chance to raise my daughter (due in January!) around the world, and I think it will be a special experience for our family. I'll be working as a diplomat, which means I will move from country to country every 2-4 years, working in the American embassies. 

I've been taking notes over the last 10 months about places shared here on this sub. Places I want to live, places I want to visit, and how badly I really don't want to fly United Airlines.

So thanks to everybody on this sub, especially /u/Fbass."

The problem is that I will be coming back June 16, and every airline that I have looked at only allows you to book 11mo in advance. If I waited 2 weeks I could make the booking, but by then I wouldn't get my visa in time. I've tried calling customer support for United airlines but the outsourced rep seemed to not be any help.

I know I could just get a one-way both times, but that comes out to be ~$3,000 whereas roundtrip is ~$1,200. Thanks for any help :)"

Right now the best deal I've found for my times is 870 dollars on Japan Airlines, with a airport change on the return trip from Haneda to Narita, with a layover of 4 hours and 15 minutes. 
The only one I could find that didn't require at least one airport change in airport in Tokyo was a 1250 dollar flight with American Airlines (though operated primarily by JAL) and a few multi-airline flights that I'd rather not take because they'd leave me with a gigantic 10 hour layover in Shanghai, and because all of them use United for the flight from ORD to shanhai, and I hate United. 

So essentially I am left with the 1250 flight or the 870 dollar flight.
I know financially it would be worth it because the ticket from HND to NRT is 4000 yen or something like that, and I don't care about the hassle  because I will only be carrying a small carry-on bag for my return trip, which is the part that has the airport change, and I'd certainly love to get some pictures since I've only ever been to Narita.

What I'm wondering is it worth the risk? Is 4.25 hours enough to make it from HND to NRT and get on my plane? and if I were to miss it would JAL put me on another flight?

I am wondering what do YOU do find works best for recompense for the situation.

For instance, my story: I was scheduled to fly with Delta to attend a wedding, so I left two days early just to be safe. My first flight was canceled since their AC was broken (since I was going to miss my connector, they rescheduled for the next day). Next flight was then canceled due to weather. Now am rescheduled for the next morning (barely going to make it in time for the wedding), but am worried about delays and cancellations again.

Called customer service who only offered small amounts of ""Delta reimbursements"" (like I would want to ever fly Delta again, since this was my first and last time, and United has given me trouble, but never like this, Southwest I love you btw).

I am wondering what you all find that you do in similar situations. How do you all find peace with the situation. Do you just never fly bad airlines? Do you get the lawyers involved? Do you just pray about it? Do you cause a fuss every time you deal with them?"
208,Spending two months as in intern working with elephants in Thailand/India...hows my packing list look?,2,4144jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4144jb/spending_two_months_as_in_intern_working_with/,10,2016-01-15 20:40:51,"Hello r/travel! I have never been outside of the United States and I'm about to spend two months abroad. I'm not sure at this moment in time if I'm more excited or nervous, either way I'm a bit nauseous all the time! I leave 17 days. Below is my packing list. What am I forgetting? What am I wasting space on? 

I'll be in Sukhothai, Thailand (near-ish Chiang Mai) for February and Bangalore, India for March. I'll be outdoors working with animals, will attend a conference in Bangalore, and will be working on papers. I don't anticipate a lot of time for sightseeing or tourist-y stuff. Advice other than packing is also greatly appreciated. 

Paperwork:
 - Passport and visas
 - Copies of passport and visas, insurance info (I have travel health insurance, regular insurance, and trip insurance thru airlines), plane itineraries. I'm also leaving copies of all of these things with my mother.

**Clothing**
 - Enough clothes for two weeks (Lightweight linen capris and shorts, tshirts, socks, underwear, sports bras)
 - 2-3 nice outfits for going out and conference
 - Big hat with SPF protection
 - Lightweight, compact rain coat
 - two pairs tennis shoes
 - 1 pair flip flops (for showers)
 - 1-2 pairs sandals/shoes to go with nicer outfits
 - maybe a bathing suit just in case?

**Toiletries**
 - my entire medicine cabinet (not really): benadryl, excedrin, ibuprofen, tylenol sinus, tylenol flu, cepacol, bismuth chews, unisom (for flights)
 - shampoo, body wash, facewash (all in bar form for easy packing)
 - extra contacts, contact lens necessities, glasses
 - couple toothbrushes, toothpaste
 - deodorant
 - as much sunblock as I can fit in my bag (I have a very pale complexion

**Other**
 - several notebooks and pens
 - address labels already prepped for postcards (I did a gofundme so sending to my supporters)
 - 200 USD hidden in my luggage
 - fanny pack (mostly for small notebook and pen while working

**Tech**
 - iphone/charger (for using wifi)
 - ipad/charger (mostly for plane)
 - laptop/charger
 - universal charger adapter
 - camera/charger

**Still considering**
 - Bug spray (suggestions? Neither area is much of a threat of malaria...)
 - phrase books for Thailand and India (again, suggestions?)

**Other questions**
 - How much baht/INR should I take out at the exchange? Like I said, not much touristy stuff, and in Thailand its a remote area and I'm being fed. In India, I'll be a little more on my own for food I think?
 - Are calling cards still a thing? Should I get one?

Thanks in advance to all you experts out there for scrolling through this list and giving me some peace of mind!

212,"First time flying with Spirit Airline ""the most hated airline""",5,5ukj3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5ukj3k/first_time_flying_with_spirit_airline_the_most/,10,2017-02-17 08:43:40,"I want to start this with saying I am not talking about everyone, some will understand where I am coming from, some won't.

I have flown countless times over the years and always went with ""big name companies"" like Delta, American, or United. I wanted to go to Vegas and fly as cheap as I could so I could do more there. After looking at flights I noticed that Spirit was by far the cheapest by $250-$400 (depending on carrier). I was shocked by this sticker price and started doing some research on the company and reading reviews. I kept reading horrible reviews and people complaining about anything and everything. Now I always take reviews with a grain of salt because most people tend to leave comments when they have been ""done wrong"" or pissed off. After much reading and thinking about it I figured I would try Spirit and see how things go. I went to their website and start booking. Everything is very clear there if take a few minutes to read. Your bare far is price of ticket... that's it. No free bags, no free carry on, no complimentary drinks/food. You literally get a spot on the plane in a seat that does not recline (which is fine as I don't ever recline my seat, and being 6'3 I prefer if the person in front of  me doesn't take my precious few inches away.) As I get farther into the booking process it tells you that you can print your own ticket or pay at the airport for your ticket, not an issue. I get to the end and my total round trip from Dallas to Vegas was $173 tax and all federal fees(and $14 for flight insurance to rebook a missed/delayed flight). Day of the flight, I get to the airport with ticket printed ready to go. I get in line to check my bag. As soon as I get into the line I see a customer having a temper tantrum. Not sure what it's about, I think great here we go, did I just make a huge mistake? The line moves and I am able to hear what's going on. They are pissed because they are asking her to pay for her bags, just as the website and the ticket she printed says. Then I see another customer complaining, same thing. As each customer moves up in line 1 out of what seemed like 5 had something to complain about, but it was all stuff that was stated on the website and even the ticket they are holding! I get to the ticket counter, check my bags no issue, as I had already paid at home (pay at home when you book and it's much cheaper). Boom now through TSA and at the gate, where yet again I see customers complaining. With spirit you can take a small personal bag but not a large carry on that most people try to take as a substitute full blown suitcase. The agents are trying to explain the rules and a few people are still pissed (yet again the information is on the site as you book, it ask you multiple times are you sure you don't want to buy now because we will charge you more at the airport.) I get on the plane now and the whole thing really is just economy seating (with the exception of the first row $35 more if you want it). The seats are just like any other economy with the exception of not reclining. The flight was 5 min late departing, but ended up making up the time. Once you are airborne they come around and offer to sell you drinks and food, honestly bring something or eat before. I don't recall the prices, but I do remember M&Ms and a Coke was $6. Return flight was the same, no delay and get back to Dallas early.

Now all that being said here is what I learned, from what I saw at the airport, I would assume the same is true for the online review, people bitch and complain because they didn't read when they booked the flight. None of it is fine print, they are blunt and upfront telling you what you get and even remind you multiple times when booking what you are paying for and what you'll be charged for at the airport if you fail to buy when booking. So no I don't think that Spirit the ""The most hated airline"" it's the airline with the most illiterate customers. If you want to fly them go for it, just read and don't blindly click. Had I not taken the extra 2 min to read what the site told me my flight would have ended costing me $400. It's a no frills airline, but after flying for years let me tell you that economy seating is economy seating and it's all the same crap when you fly. I can't say anything for what happens when you miss your flight, but you know they say to be there 2 hours ahead of time. I do that and it's never failed me.     "

I have some general ideas about what i want to do but i was wondering if anyone had some advice or tips for me. Besides tips for Portugal, any general Euro traveling tips from flying to packing would be of great assistance. This will be my first time outside of North America so i really want to make sure this trip is great!

To begin, i plan to travel in late June- mid July around 3 weeks worth of vacation. My flight is being paid for so i have around 4,000 to spend on hostels/hotels/Posadas, food, activities, ect. The reason i chose Portugal is because my grandparents loved it back when they visited. This trip will be my final chance of freedom before i get a full time job so i plan on relaxing (alot of beach time  is a preference) and getting as much culture as i can. Alsoi am a huge history buff.

My plan is to fly into Lisbon and spend a few nights there. Then head north and visit a few cities for a few days (maybe Coimbra or Porto). Then head south and spend the rest of my vacation there (maybe Lagos or faro Municipalty). I was also thinking of maybe crossing the border into Spain and visiting Seville but im still not 100 percent on that. I would lovbe to hear any suggestions on cities or areas to visit.

In terms of traveling i havent researched enough on it but i would be willing to rent a car, though traveling by train seems easier for me. I would love to hear your opinions on the best way of getting around Portugal. 

This question is for flying to Europe. Not to reveal to much info on where i am from i would be flying out of the bay area. What is the best way to fly to Europe in terms of routes. Also what airlines would you recommend. The only airline i have experience with is United for cross country flights (i would rate them a 3/5). 

I'm sorry if i left anything out and i will respond with haste if you need anymore info. This is my first real vacation im planning on my own so i really want to make sure i get it right. Even if you havent been to Portugal but have any advice I really appreciate it."

Unfortunately, I'm finding it VERY difficult obtaining reasonable ticket prices for only one airline. The ticket prices when traveling with multiple airlines is so much more inexpensive. Is there a way for me to fly with multiple airlines, whose layovers will be in EU countries, and not risk my pups being quarantined, because she has not had the blood titer test??

**My doubt is:** it would be a problem present my spanish passport in Brazil in the departure and in the arrival, explaining my situation?
I've already called the United Airlines (the company I'll travel with) to ask for assistance, but they weren't very helpful. They've just said about the ticket name matching the passport name.

I reside in Canada and will be moving abroad to work in Taiwan. After a lot of research it's still unclear how my French Bulldog can be in the airplane cabin with me (I am worried that things can go wrong after all the events that happened with United).

Air Canada allows pets in cabins under certain conditions. One of[Air Canada pet policy](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/plan/special-assistance/pets.html) mentions the following: 

Your pet cannot travel with you in the cabin if you:

◾Are travelling in Premium Economy on a Boeing 787-8 (788), Boeing 787-9 (789) or A330-300 (333) aircraft

and then it says 

◾On Boeing 777-300ER and 777-200LR  aircraft, the pet carrier cannot exceed these dimensions :

...dimensions are given...

The problem now is that some of the flights I found are only the Boeings 787-8 (788), 787-9 (789), or A330-300 (333) ..

OR....

It starts with a 777-300ER/777-200LR   and then because of a layover it's then a Boeing 787-8 (788), 787-9 (789), or A330-300 (333).

I'm open to travel with other airlines if I have to but I'd prefer having my dog with me because of Brachycephalic condition.

**Questions that need to be answered:**

\- what kind of papers do you specifically need to show once landing in Taiwan?

\- do you need to contact the embassy of the foreign country that you bring your pet?

\- how long do they stay in quarantine if its necessary?

\- Does anyone have experience and how did it go?

\- What are your recommendations?

I had a pretty tough time while flying over here (this might be biased, I have never flown alone before).

My flight from MSP to O'Hare was delayed by an hour (poor weather conditions), and I ended up missing my flight to Dublin. I suppose I should have given more time to make my next flight, but my boyfriend wrote the itinerary. Fortunately, when I spoke to a United Airlines employee, they were able to rewrite my itinerary to make it to Turkey. 

They suggested flying through Washington DC - Munich - Turkey (final destination). 

There was an additional flight leaving for Munich the next evening (mind you, it was 10 pm local time, the plane to Munich was leaving at 6 pm or so the next evening). I opted for this because I would get to Turkey at the same time (and I prefer to take fewer planes). 

I was given a cot to sleep in until 4am. I would have graciously appreciated keeping the cot longer because I desperately needed sleep, and I was definitely not too ladylike sleeping on the chairs inside the airport. 

6 pm slowly inched closer, and I boarded the plane to Munich. Things were going really well until I was asked to get off the plane to talk to someone. 

A Border and Customs officer was concerned by my rapid flight schedule changes. Apparently, when I was having my new itinerary written, the employee didn't view possible itineraries, he scheduled me on all of them. I was asked for my personal information, my name, my passport number, where I was going....blah blah....

I was allowed to board the plane, god bless, I was crying at this point. 

My total travel time was about 48 hours, I left Monday morning, and arrived Wednesday morning (with respects to MN time, it was Wednesday evening in Turkey). 

I encountered no issues in Munich, it was so pretty!!!

I did, however, lose my luggage. I just got it back 2 days ago, they found it in Munich. My boyfriend was happy when it came, I brought some vanilla coke in the suitcase (they don't sell it here). I guess a good ending?"

Me and my wife are looking to travel in September, 2018 (date flexible, preferably depart Sept 8th) on a one way flight to Athens, Greece. We're going to then go to Sicily and Rome, where we'll fly home approximately two weeks later (flight back on or around the 21st). We would LOVE to fly business class if possible without breaking the bank, and we have a few points saved up. Here are the current stats:

110,000 points saved with Citi thankyou. Points are transferrable to Turkish Airlines, Asia Miles, Avianca Lifemiles, Ethiad Guest, Eva Air, Flying Blue (KLM, Airfrance), jetpriveledge, quantas, quatar airlines, singapore airlines, virgin atlantic and a few others. 
Points would transfer at a 1:1 rate for miles. 

I've been doing research, and I keep seeing ads or promotions for ""business class to greece on this date"" from Flying Blue for 62500 miles, but as soon as I try to find the dates or anything near it, it's generally from 185,000+ miles on anything close. 

I've done a lot of research on different airlines and prices around this date, and the advertised lowest prices stem from United (~70k miles for one way) and Delta/AirFrance (advertised 62,500), but like I said above, I can't actually find that anywhere.  

Extra things to know: my wife and I spend about $3,000 a month and can always open new credit cards. The trip is in a long time so we could theoretically do another card (or two) to get the additional bonus miles. 

Dates are flexible, but we do want to capitalize on or near that exact time stated (sept 8th in to athens, sept 21 out of Rome). 

Any advise on which airlines I should transfer miles to? Or who can get me the most out of our money? Business class would be amazing if possible. "

My husband and I have our trip from Boston to New Zealand coming up next Saturday. We leave from Boston at 6PM and arrive in SFO at 9:51PM their time.

We then have a 54 minute connection to get from there to our next flight at 10:45PM, which goes straight to New Zealand.

Everyone I have talked to says this is insane, but United has assured me multiple times that it's a legal connection. Our next option is one with a 7 hour layover in SFO (not a big deal to us), but we most likely will not be able to sit together (also online it is making me pick our seats again for ALL the flights, including the one from SFO to New Zealand even though that is the same flight we have currently - of course there are no longer seats beside each other for the 13 hour flight to NZ).

We booked separately with our MileagePlus cards so we could use points (normally a $3,000 flight we paid $75 for taxes/fess). Neither of us fly much, so I picked this flight without realizing just how risky the connection was. 

We are taking carry-on bags only to help cut down on time, and the flight is the same throughout (all United Airline flights), but it does mention a ""Terminal change"" on the itinerary.

I am panicking. What do others think?  "

Just got a new job where I’ll be traveling 35-45 weeks/year. I’ve never travelled for work and don’t know how to maximize benefits/rewards for frequent flying and hotel stays. I’m a little overwhelmed with all of the programs and how they work. 

I will mostly stay in Marriott hotels. I will usually have the option to fly either Delta or United. 

I’ll stay in hotels much more than I’ll fly, because I will do a lot of driving to my work locations. I will fly 10-20 times/year, but I’ll be in hotels for well over 200 nights per year. I like the idea of doing a brand loyal program because of the upgrades that come along with them (like flight upgrades, airport lounges, free checked bags, hotel suite upgrades, free hotel stays). 

Therefore, is my best option to go with two separate cards, one Marriott rewards card and one either United or Delta? Are there cards that combine the two?  Or because I'm staying in hotels more than flying, should I just get a Marriott card and strictly use that for all travel expenses then just accrue airline miles as I fly by being a member of the program without a card (and also have the option of transferring Marriott points to Delta or United)?

I've heard a lot of bad things about United, so my expectations are really low. What are some things I can do to make this experience not so shitty?

In total, I'm taking four flights with them. LAX to EWR (red-eye), EWR to BOS. Then on my return trip, BOS to SFO and SFO to LAX.

I think I'm the most scared about my baggage being lost and missing a connecting flight. I usually only take a carry on (my trips elsewhere are usually short), but since I will be gone a week I will for sure have to check in a bag. So I really hope nothing gets lost. Also, looking at the flights I have booked, I have about an hour to an hour and a half between connecting flights. I hope I don't miss any :( 

I also added Trip Protection to my flight, but I don't know if this actually does anything."

230,Flying to London in 2 months. Question about airlines and tickets.,2,1ve8ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ve8ut/flying_to_london_in_2_months_question_about/,9,2014-01-17 00:57:28,"So I'm going to London (LHR) from Los Angeles (LAX) in March. 

I was going to buy my ticket this week. And was wondering if any of you have any experience with that route and/or have suggestions on good airlines. I've read that Air New Zealand is good. But right now United/ Lufthansa / Air Canada is the cheapest. 

Also is it better to wait and see if ticket prices drop? I'm about 2 months from departure. (March 6). I've the tickets seemed to have drop around $100 since about a month. Will there be a chance for more price drops? Or should I lock it down now? I'm trying to get it in the $800-$900 range. Lowest is around $822 right now. 


Sorry for the long post. Any help or info or advice would be much appreciated! Thanks!







UPDATE: I paid $828. I'm only 7 weeks out and I'm comfortable with the price right now and don't want to risk it going back up. Taking United out there but my flights back are done by Lufthansa so that's good! Thanks for all the advice and information! "
231,"A Long Return Home, or ""Why I will never book again with United"", a 3-day Odyssey across Americans airports.",22,25ml7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/25ml7h/a_long_return_home_or_why_i_will_never_book_again/,9,2014-05-15 18:25:25,"This whole adventure began as a trip between friends. I had a previous bad experience with United, but I'd like to believe that shit happens and that people deserve a second chance. I applied the same mentality to United. That was mistake #2 (#1 is booking with United in the first place).

So Monday morning, my trip partners and I are waiting at the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport. Finding out we are splitted on 2 different flights, they depart for Philly while I'm waiting for my flight to Chicago. The original flight plan was Minneapolis-Chicago/3 hours layover/Chicago-Halifax,NS (ETA 00:15 or so...).

About 30 minutes before departure (I was becoming worried since usually they start boarding at this point) there is no plane to be found for the flight. On departure time, they announce that the flight is cancelled since the plane has mecanical issues. Still trying to stay positive, I get rebooked for the next flight since it doesn't impact my connecting flight (Ill simply spend 3 hrs in Minneapolis instead of Chicago). We finally depart the airport with a bit of delay, heading for Chicago.

It was supposed to be a short flight. After a good nap, I wake up and the lady next to me start to get worried since she said she'll be late for her connecting flight if we don't get to Chicago soon. I also notice the plane goes into a circular flight path and doesn't seem to start the approach maneuvers. The pilot finally announce that we are being diverted to Grand Rapids, MI for a quick refuel since thunderstorms are stopping airport activities.


My optimistic attitude began to fade away at this point. 


We land in Grand Rapids, MI and the pilot inform us that we are required to leave the plane. Being aware of some of the safety precautions we have to take in the Navy in regards to fuelling, we are told to wait in the terminal. After a couple of hours and the inability to get any answer from either the pilot, the crew or event the airport staff, I start to question myself. The clock display 05:40 PM

Then suddenly, the pilot and the rest of the crew re-embark the plane to depart, without the passengers. They unloaded the luggages and ditched us in the fine commune of Grand Rapids. *slow claps* The clock displays 08:30-09:00 pm approx.

The poor staff at Grand Rapids airport were as flabbergasted as we were. They were doing everything they could, but re-booking about 40 pissed of passengers is quite a task for 2 individuals. At this point I was aware that I would not make it home in time. So Im trying to contact my bosses and inform them of my location. After receiving confirmation that they know what kind of shit show Im in, I try to rebook a flight with the exhausted staff from the airport. Keep in mind that at the same time, 3-4 flights came in, refuelled and left for their destination already. Only the United flight I was on got stranded there (as far as I know, please correct me if I'm wrong).

After a bit of discussion with the staff, they found a way to provide me with an hotel room since my first flight was a mecanical failure and not an ""Act of God"" (*srly???*). They also rebook me for a flight the upcoming afternoon, but also put me on standby for the 12:30 flight for Chicago. At this time, the clock display 03:20 AM

After a short night of sleep, I'm heading back to Gerard R. Ford airport (aka Grand Rapids, MI airport), hoping to get on that flight I'm on standby for. The airport staff are able to provide me with a ticket for that flight and Im getting ready to board the flight to O'Hare.
Seems like my stroke of bad luck is about to end. The clock now displays 12:00 PM.


**WRONG!**


After delaying the flight twice, they announce us over speaker that O'Hare has an issue (aka fire in the bathroom....SRLY???) in the Control Tower and diverted more flight to that tiny airport (read here 1 concession stand in the boarding area and 2 bathroom). The airport staff is overloaded and getting slowly tired of the pile of shit they are rerouting to their tiny airport.

I'm slowly becoming aware that I won't probably make it either today to Halifax, and get in touch with my boss again saying that I'm still stranded in the US. As a joke, I started debating if I should start to fill paperwork for my citizenship. I should have. It is now 5:00 pm.

After getting cleared , they board a flight nobody heard about for Chicago. The guy that tried to sort my issue and was able to issue me an hotel room for the night is back at this point. After seeing me, noticing that there is one First Class seat available and being aware that I only have my backpack and a small bag, book me and sends me to Chicago on this flight. In the meantime, he also announce me that my flight to Halifax was delayed and that I will be able to catch it.
To that Ginger guy in Grand Rapids, thank you. You're one of the 2 people that were able to help me get back home.

So, I'm finally in Chicago. Im heading to my gate. My hopes of getting home and seeing my GF are fairly high at this point. It is 5:40pm. My flight is scheduled for 6:30pm with an ETA of 11:50pm.
I grab food at the McD since it's almost right next to my gate and begin the wait. Then....Gate swap! Followed by another gate swap!


Then the second night of adventure begins....


At 6:15pm, they delay the departure for 7:30pm. Not a big deal I think since I'll be home tonight. Here I was wrong again.
This pattern got repeated until 11:00pm that night. Then, they finally cancelled it. We were actually the last flight that got cancelled that night. That wasn't playing in my favor. 


In the meantime, I met 3 girls travelling back to Halifax from Louisiana and 1 dude that was on a 1-day business trip also trying to head back to Nova Scotia. So we tackled the problem of finding a solution to get our asses back into Canucks Country. Time is now 00:00am.

After being told to go to Customer Service/Help desk by the United employees, we came to the realisation we were the last flight that got cancelled and that a horde of angry/tired/pissed off passengers were already trying to get rebooked for another flight.

Here comes the comedy relief of this episode. Mid-40s, half bad, overweight and slightly dumb United employed. He divert us towards a free United counter in order to try to help us. Then he gives us a 1-800 number we should call to try to rebook. I'm about to lose my temper at this point. I simply inform him that if he wants us to do that, I'll gladly do it if United agrees to pay for the upcoming phone bill since all of us are on roaming at this point. He looked like someone explained him that the Earth is actually round and not flat at this point. Then a nice United lady came and booked us on an American Airlines flight to Toronto with a connection to Toronto. I was really skeptical at this point since the travel time and the connection to Halifax didn't make sense, but I had a ticket with someone else than United, so I shut my yapper and hoped for the best. I also inquired for an hotel room with the half-bald guy that graciously (Im being sarcastic here) that a fire in the tower is not United's fault. I then inform him that if I'm in Chicago today, it's because United originally FUCKED UP (I'm becoming slightly aggresive at this point...) and that I think I deserve something better than a chair based on their inability to get shit straight. After a long chain of bla bla blas and informing him that I will make sure to never fucking travel again with United and that he was a proud representation of the company he worked for (in other words, retarded, fighting against evolution and would greatly improve the overall quality of life of any living organism on this planet by dissapearing).

Vacating the premises with the 3 cute girls that were heading to Halifax, we find a concession restaurant with booths and sleep on these uncomfortable pieces of shit. We tried to find cots, but they were all taken at the time we completed the shenanigans with the ""more-than-competent"" staff from United.
Time 01:30 AM


Fast forward to 4:00 AM, I woke up to the sound of PA announcements. Myself and the 3 girls (I only remember the name of the cute blonde one. She was a real hottie and we had good laughs together) are heading the the American Airlines boarding area where we are supposed to get on our flight to Toronto. After discussing with the lady at the desk we find out that we are in fact NOT on this flight or any other that the United staff confirmed us we were on. But that lady did an amazing work and got all 4 of us on that plane in direction of Toronto.

After landing in Toronto, we figure out that we wont be able to get our boarding passes AND the girls luggages in time to make it to our next flight to Halifax.

After getting thru customs, I'm heading to Air Canada ticketing booth. There the lady look a bit shocked by the things I give her (originally provided by the United staff) but finds a way to put me on the 2:30 PM flight to Halifax. The girls didn't had my chance. Their luggages never got loaded into the first flight (AA's one) and got then rerouted thru Montreal to get to Halifax eventually way later than me.

I finally landed in Halifax at 5:30 pm (Atlantic Time) after a 3 day odyssey around America's airports.

If there's a morale to find in my store, it would be something like : Just don't book with United. Pay that extra 2-300$ and have peace of mind. I lost 2 days of works and if it wasn't of that ginger guy in Grand Rapids and the short lady at the American Airways desk in O'hare, I would have submitted my immigration papers.

232,Airplane Delay/Cancellation - Feel like I screwed up?,4,9c0o0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9c0o0a/airplane_delaycancellation_feel_like_i_screwed_up/,9,2018-09-01 09:24:33,"Hello!!

Not sure if anyone will see this but I don't really know where else to post this and I just feel so anxious and stressed and I don't know how airports/flights work...

So I'm about to return to college but my flight (United Airlines) at 5AM gets delayed by 3 hours - and it means I would miss my connecting flight which departs at 8AM. I naturally freaked out and I saw that on the app United was offering travel waivers because of storms and weathers - which would let me change my flight to another one which I thought was a good idea!

I changed my flight to be tomorrow instead to avoid this issue because I thought that I would be stranded at the airport if I missed my connecting flight. I don't really fly airplanes that much, but I did some research online and read some comments about people saying that if you miss a connecting flight not of your own fault, the airline will help get you on the next flight!

I didn't know about this and now I'm feeling really stupid and anxious - is this really true? Did I just unnecessarily delay my travel by a day just because I'm stupid? I tried to change my flight back to the original one - but it wouldn't let me change back...

I'm so stressed and I don't know if this same situation is going to happen again tomorrow where I will miss a connecting flight due to weather delays/etc. and I don't know how to handle missing a connecting flight. Will I really be stranded at the airport? I would really appreciate any help if anyone is able to offer advice.

Thank you so much!!! <3"
