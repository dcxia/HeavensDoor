0,Thoughts/discussion on UAL 3411,47,64r1ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/64r1ua/thoughtsdiscussion_on_ual_3411/,267,2017-04-11 18:11:53,"I don't work for an airline, but I have spent my entire life deeply connected to aviation. I grew up traveling a lot, I have family members working for US carriers, friends who are pilots, and I've spent my entire career as an engineer in the aerospace industry. In the last year alone, I've flown across the country dozens of times (work related), and at least once on every major US airline.

So I'm pretty familiar with most aspects of the industry. The incident on Sunday is a big deal, but I want to go through what happened and talk about it a little. So, from everything I've read, here's the chain of events.

1. United Airlines had ~~an overbooked~~ **edit:** *a fully booked* flight from ORD to SDF.
2. UAL also had to ferry a crew from ORD to SDF, and decided to put the crew on the already overbooked flight because said flight was the only one available. 
3. ORD gate agents asked for volunteers to give up their seats, but still permitted passengers to board the planes.
4. Gate agents then said the plane would not depart until four volunteers gave up their seats, and increased the offer amount.
5. Gate agents then randomly selected passengers to have their seats pulled. A couple was deplaned without incident and then the doctor was selected.
6. The doctor refused to give up his seat, stating that he had medical proceedings to attend to in the morning and needed to take that flight.
7. Gate agents continue to order the passenger off the plane, and he again refused and begun to call his lawyer. Gate agents informed him that they would bring airport security and he continued to refuse.
8. Airport Police showed up and confronted him, passenger continued to refuse to deboard. 
9. Two more police officers arrive and the passenger continues to refuse to deboard.
10. The video that we've all seen begins. The airport police grab the passenger, drag him out of his seat (knocking him unconscious in the process) and off of the plane.
11. The passenger eventually managed to get back on to the plane, exhibiting symptoms of a serious head injury.
12. The plane was completely deboarded and cleaned due to biohazards (blood).

On bigger subs, I've seen a lot of discussion around this issue that tend to gravitate towards these opinions:

* The airline had no right to revoke his ticket, as he was a paying customer.
* The airline was using law enforcement illegally to enforce their will.
* The airline employees were lazy for wanting to fly to Louisville, instead of driving.

So here are my (personal) comments on the chain of events.

1. Airlines should be prohibited from overbooking flights. Yes, I know it is an optimization trick and it keeps ticket prices down, but it's not really fair to passengers and creates very problematic situations. Airlines should increase ticket prices or cancellation fees if need be, but they should be forced to eat the cost of lost revenue from missed itineraries.
2. This is actually a semi-common practice. I don't know UAL's specific policies, but airlines generally can't require their flight crew to have to drive to their destination to make a flight. However, the airline *knew* that the plane was already booked to capacity, so planning on the flight crew to take this route was already a fuckup on their part. They could easily have sent the flight crew down on a flight on another airline, even one the next day. Instead, the airline decided to use their own plane which is not illegal, but is problematic for passengers.
3. I assume the gate agents thought they could save time by boarding pax while calling for volunteers, because often enough people will volunteer. In this incident, the flight was the next day and the offer obviously wasn't good enough for anyone. Gate agents shouldn't board pax until they know they have the seats to fit everyone, but, again, I don't know UAL's policy here so they weren't *necessarily* violating anything. This was a pretty big fuckup though.
4. And the decision to board bites the gate agents in the ass, when they realize they didn't actually get any volunteers. 
5. The gate agents definitely had room to keep increasing the offer amount, but they decided it wasn't worth it. Per most carrier contracts, they were not doing anything illegal though. Airlines *are* permitted to revoke tickets at basically any time at their discretion.  The justification in this case of *we need these seats to ferry crew* is not illegal. It's frustrating, but DOT rules do handsomely reward passengers who are booted involuntarily. Airlines typically will offer flight vouchers, but if the passengers request it the airline must cut the passengers a check for 4x the price of the ticket, or a maximum of $1300. You still get the ticket the next day, too. That's a good deal of money. The couple that got bumped before the doctor could have taken their $2600 and had a very, very good night in Chicago. In many cases that doesn't fix it, but it softens the blow a lot.
6. Gate agents have probably heard it all, and were probably thinking something like: *""Everyone on board has a million reasons why they have to be on this plane tonight. We need to get this guy off so we can get this plane out of the gate.""* Now. Granted. They have the power to have changed their minds here and and redone the selection to pick someone else, but they weren't required to and they didn't, for any number of reasons. In hindsight, they probably should have, but I'm sure it crossed their mind and they assumed that if they relented on this *one* passenger, everyone else would refuse to deboard too.
7. Situation escalates. Passenger calls his lawyer. This is where the passenger also starts to take some of the blame. The airline does legally have the right to remove the passenger, so the passenger was actually trespassing by this point because his ticket was cancelled and he was informed of it. You can argue whether or not airlines *should* be permitted to do this, but currently the airline *is* permitted. This is what some of that fine print that you scroll through when buying a ticket says
8. Understand that at this point, the passenger had had his ticket revoked and was no longer legally permitted on the plane. The doctor was disobeying gate agent orders and the gate agents need him to be off the plane. The gate agents were *not in the wrong* for calling airport police in this situation, because airport police are responsible for removing unruly passengers. Again, the doctor was, technically, trespassing. The gate agents clearly couldn't remove him so they had no other choice. 
9. By this point, I believe the passenger is at fault. When police officers are ordering you to get off of the plane, at some point you should. At this point, it's a maturity thing. The man was a highly educated doctor and *should have known* what would happen if he continued to disobey the airport police. I know this sounds like a ""Citizen, pick up that can"" kind of moment, but by the contract that the passenger agreed to, he needed to leave. This could happen anywhere. He should have gotten off of the plane, collected his money, and pursued other means to legally punish UAL for booting him. He wasn't losing any rights, he probably wouldn't have been arrested (More likely received a stern lecture), but he continued to resist the officer's direct orders.
10. This is where the Airport Police fuck up severely. From the video you can *clearly* see that the officer loses his patience and forcefully drags the doctor out of his seat. The officer leaves the arm rests down and yanks the doctor across the row and out into the aisle. This is a gross overuse of force by the police. The doctor was not violently resisting, but he was treated with violence and seriously injured in the process. Getting knocked unconcious happens all of the time in movies, TV shows, etc. But it's actually a *huge* deal and requires a lot of medical attention to ensure that a TBI hasn't occured. The officer also dragged him out of the plane by his arms, which is the wrong way to move an unconscious individual due to the risk of causing further damage. 
11. The fact that the doctor managed to get back onto the plane indicates that the police officers did not immediately call for medical assistance or continue to properly detain the doctor once he regained consciousness. This is, again, a colossal fuckup on their part, because it demonstrates that they probably did not follow any real sort of procedure once they got the guy off of the plane. Unfortunately, we don't have footage of what happened, but it is apparent that they straight up left the guy lying on the ground and stopped attending him long enough for him to stumble down the gate and back on to the plane unhindered. As I mentioned, if you watch the video, the doctor is *clearly* exhibiting signs of a concussion. 
12. The plane was delayed for a couple of hours due to the actions of the gate agents and the police. 

So here are the major issues *I* have with the whole event.

* Airline policies that permit pretty awful treatment of passengers, including overbooking and involuntary removal, and policies where the ""best"" solution was to boot paying customers for crew logistical reasons. That's poor planning and the airline should have found a better way to ferry the crew.

* Gate agents are given a lot of power. Sometimes they use this to help passengers, but they also can inconvenience everyone as they did here. The gate agents should *not* have boarded the plane until they had room for everyone, and they could have given the doctor leeway to fly on the plane given his extenuating circumstances. 

* The doctor should have deboarded when the first airport police officer arrived. At that point, he should have known he wasn't going to win, and frankly I agree with the assertion by the former Continental CEO that the doctor was being immature at that point. He would have been handsomely compensated and as other people have mentioned, it would not have been difficult to rent a car and drive to Louisville, or to book a later flight with another airline, or to have taken a train, or a bus... I've had flights cancelled on me before, and in one instance I split a car rental with a few other passengers and we drove to our destination. 

* The airport police were obscenely out of line with how they handled the situation. From violently removing the passenger, to causing a serious head injury, to literally *dragging* him off of the plane, to leaving him on the floor of the airport without treatment or supervision. No part of their handling of the matter was ok. The officers should have lifted the arm rests and pulled the passenger out and escorted him off. Violence was absolutely the wrong answer.



**** 

So; my long-winded rant is out of the way. What do you guys think of the situation? What could the airline/crew/doctor/police have done better? Who do you think could be assigned blame here? How does this affect your opinion of UAL? "

9,I flew about 1800 miles...for lunch.,89,4fp7cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/4fp7cl/i_flew_about_1800_milesfor_lunch/,43,2016-04-20 23:53:29,"Well, it wasn't JUST for lunch, but that's what happened anyway. A few weeks back a friend of mine noticed that United Airlines had a round-trip flight (same-day) from San Francisco (SFO) to Chicago's O'Hare (ORD) for $120 on a Boeing 747-400. Being a younger aviation enthusiast who had never been on a 747 (and who may not fly one again, considering the fact that many airlines are thinking about getting rid of them), I nabbed the ticket, along with a few other friends. Our group was a bunch of aviation majors from San Jose State, and most of us had not flown in a 747 before. 

Yesterday (04/19/2016) we left a beautiful, sunny SFO at about 0900 local time and spent about 3 hours on United Flight UA620. The on-board WiFi was down most of the time, but the views were great, the drinks were refreshing, and everyone in our group was pretty psyched to be there. We landed in Chicago around 1500 local time, and, with about 45 minutes to spare, we grabbed some Chicago deep-dish pizza, a Chicago-style hot dog, and a cold beer inside Terminal C (the one that's connected to the rest of the airport by a tunnel). 

Around 1545 we boarded the 747 once again (Flight UA1213) and spent another 3 hours returning home. Our flight both ways was pretty smooth, and the plane itself, though older, was fairly comfortable. Once we landed in SFO at around 1800 local time, I asked the flight attendant if we could take a look inside the cockpit and the upper deck, to which she happily replied ""Yes"". The upper deck was smaller than I thought, but the seats looked like super-comfy recliners. You could tell that the cockpit was pretty old by the brown-colored, retro-styled design (unfortunately we couldn't take pictures). Yet the avionics were all glass, and despite what looked like a Flight Engineer's station, no FE was needed.

All-in-all, our group had a great time, and only later that evening did it hit me that, in less than 12 hours, we had traveled all the way from San Francisco to Chicago and back...for pizza, beer, and hot dogs. God Bless America!!!

(Link to a few photos from the trip: http://imgur.com/a/X7jQT) 

(Bonus points if you know the cities in the pics!)

Edit: it was brought to my attention that the 747-400 never needed a flight engineer. That is correct- it was designed for a 2-person crew. My mistake. Yet in the cockpit was what looked like an engineer's station, completely empty of instrumentation. Maybe it was there for additional equipment that was no longer needed?"
10,My mother reached 30 years of service with United today...,326,2a9yzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/2a9yzw/my_mother_reached_30_years_of_service_with_united/,40,2014-07-10 01:41:52,"So, I got a text from my mother today. She let me know that she just found out that today is her 30th anniversary with United. I asked if they did anything for her. She told me no. I asked how she found out. I thought at least a manager of some sort had come up and congratulated her on her 30 years with the company. She said that she only found out through payroll. Since the company merged it seems that they do not really seem to care. So I thought, this should not stand. I cannot make the airline recognize her service and devotion to the company that she once loved. But maybe I can do something. My mother has long loved the old United posters for Hawaii, I was thinking I could get one of the posters that she does not own yet. But I thought, that's not enough. I wanted to maybe find someone who can sign the poster for her. Since Walter Varney (founder of United) died in my mothers home town of Santa Barbara back in 1968 and could not find out much more info on any founders I was running out of ideas. But then, I came across an article on Ron Akana. This guy is the oldest living flight attendant and has flown with United for over 60 years! He is also from Hawaii and I figured this guy would be great! But then I hit a snag. I cannot find any contact info for this fine gentleman. This is where I hope that you guys all come in. Anyone know where I can get a hold of him? Contact email or a publicist? Also, any other ideas on people I may be able to contact to try and get an epic signature for my mom for her 30 years of service.

Thanks in advance."

My problem lies within choosing a college/University and choosing the right degree. I.E. Some schools have different names, different curriculum, different requirements etc.

**What's the difference between Aviation Flight Science and Aerospace Flight Technology and Operations? There are many different names out there. Please clarify if they are all the same or different.** 

Here's the rundown:

Out of state student, On-Campus (PA no longer has any colleges/Universities with Aviation Flight Science according to the book in the guidance office at my school)

I've read the [sidebar info thread for civilian pilots](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/pic9w/want_to_be_a_pilot_in_the_united_states_a_helpful/).

I've done a /r/Aviation search regarding degrees/colleges and came up with the following posts that were meaningful:

[DAE Have a Bachelors degree in Professional Aeronautics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/gdug1/dae_have_a_bachelors_degree_in_professional/)
Some notable comments include people being successful with maintenance, helicopters, and foreign jobs. Others include not so successful people that have graduated from Embry-Riddle.

[Help with colleges](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/wkzwq/help_with_colleges/) - Get a non-aviation degree so you have something to back yourself up on.

* Auburn University good program; in the 30k range without flight fees.

* Middle Tennesee State University has a good program; in the 30k range without 
flight fees.

* Southern Illonois University in Carbondale has a good program; 30k range without flight fees.

* Central Washington University has a relatively good program, but still in the 30k range without flight fees.

* Washington State University has a good, but small program that's closing in on 40k w/o flight fees.

* Kansas State has a good flight program that's has a nice flight; in 30k range w/o flight fees.

* University of North Dakota - Good program, but you have to live in North Dakota for 4 years; about 30k w/o flight fees

*Brevard College of Miama - Simply suggestion; about 35k w/o flight fees

[Has anyone here gone through a college and used Financial aid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/h6v4j/has_anyone_here_gone_through_a_college_and_used/)

* Purdue has a good program, lots of out-of-state, 40k range w/o flight fees.

[Any aviation college or colleges with aviation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/oysah/any_aviation_college_or_colleges_with_aviation/)

* Basic list of colleges, no real backing, all are 30k range w/o flight fees.

* Florida Tech - Personal bias says this is a fairly good college, user recommends it because of flying weather. 50k range according to collegeboard

[Who can tell me more about college aviation] (http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/t5tqy/who_can_tell_me_more_about_college_aviation/)

>Make flying and education completely separate endeavors. Get a degree that will be useful when not flying. Get a business degree. Better yet, do something technical that has broad job prospects and is highly portable. You are definitely going to need it.

* This entire post and it's comment basically said **do not** get an aviation degree as they worthless.

___________________________________________________________________

* **What kind of job do you want?**

Although, I do not want a job in the airline industry. My current goals are either OTS or ROTC is the college I pick offers it.  I believe I have a good chance of being selected for UPT with the work I've put in during high school (activites, volunteer hours, scholarships, clubs, fitness). If I do not get selected for UPT I will apply to ANG / AF Reserve units across the country.

* **Why military?**

Obligatory ""I come from a military family"" statement. I enjoy the structured life mainly. You have one job and you do it. You get fed, housed, and some nice benefits. Also, military aircraft are pretty badass. (Some civilian aircraft are badass as well).

I've done what others have told me: talk to pilots, military personnel, congressmen, senators, ex-Pilots. I've gained a great bit of information and I've decided it's right for me. **I am not going to let someone else's experiences ruin my own**
____________________________________________________________________

**Closing Statement**

I don't care if you read it, if you have any advice, experiences, gripes, or complaints just throw them out there.

I plan on keeping this updated and provide much more detail for each University with links, financial aid calculators, flight fees, and eventually a list of scholarships.

**15/3/2014**

The search area shifts to the southern Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Australia. A robotic submarine searched the seabed for pings from the flight data recorders (FDR) until May 28.



**17/3/2014**

The Australian Government takes lead of the search for the missing flight. Co-ordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the search will be focused on an area of 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 square miles).

This search will continue, in varying intensities, until January 2017.



**29/7/2015**

The [right flaperon of a Boeing 777-200ER](https://imgur.com/Jk69EW4) is found on Réunion Island. On August 5, this flaperon would be confirmed to have come from 9M-MRO, making it the first conclusive wreckage found.



**23/3/2016**

A fragment of a [Rolls-Royce engine cowling](https://imgur.com/ET7ax0s) and a [folding table from an aircraft cabin](https://imgur.com/76HxOeA) was found on a beach in South Africa. On May 12, these would be confirmed as having come from 9M-MRO.



**17/1/2017**

Australia, Malaysia and China jointly announce the suspension of the search.



**17/10/2017**

Malaysia receives a proposal from Ocean Infinity to continue the search for the aircraft. A few days later, they release a press statement announcing that they have accepted the offer.



**23/1/2018**

[Ocean Infinity resumes the search for the aircraft.](https://oceaninfinity.com/mh370/)



**Theories**

There are countless theories about what happened to flight 370, I will be looking at the most plausible ones.


**Pilot Suicide**

From the day that the Malaysian authorities announced that the captain had flown similar flights on his home simulator, the media have been circulating the idea that the loss of flight 370 was a suicide mission. A document released by Malaysian police confirmed that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah had a built a quite in-depth simulator in his home. Officials were able to extract data from Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and each data point had information about the simulated aircrafts altitude, speed, direction and a number of key parameters.

The statement from the Malaysian Government reads:

>Search officials believe MH370 followed a similar route, based on signals the plane transmitted to a satellite after ceasing communications and turning off course. The actual and the simulated flights were not identical, though, with the simulated endpoint some 900 miles from the remote patch of southern ocean area where officials believe the plane went down. Based on the data in the document, [here's a map of the simulated flight compared to the route searchers believe the lost airliner followed](https://imgur.com/5VBZzEg).

However, after his disappearance, friends and family members came forward to described Zaharie as ""an affable, helpful family man who enjoyed making instructional YouTube videos"" - hardly the typical profile of a mass murderer.



**Fire onboard**

Fires onboard aircraft are not all that uncommon. Fires have been known to cause the demise of aircraft in the past, but the fact that flight 370 flew for nearly *7 hours* without making a mayday call leads experts to believe that this is not the case. While fires can engulf an aircraft quickly, they rarely leave no time to contact air traffic control.

The leading fire theory speculates that ""A fire, possibly electrical or from an overheated tyre on take-off, sent smoke into the cockpit shortly after the crew signed off with Malaysian air traffic controllers.""

However this theory fails when one is reminded of the ping detected by satellite at 08:11:00 on the morning of March 8. According to analysis provided by the Malaysian and United States governments, the pings narrowed the location of MH370 at that moment to one of two arcs, one in Central Asia and the other in the southern Indian Ocean. As MH370 flew on its original course toward it was headed toward neither. Without human intervention it simply could not have reached the position we know it attained at 8:11 a.m



**Hijacking**

When an aircraft deviates thousands of miles from its intended course, of course a hijacking comes to mind. Since the 9/11 attacks though, numerous measures have been taken to ensure that would-be hijackers are denied access to the cockpit, let alone take control of the aircraft. The 777, just like every other commercial airliner, is fitted with a security door, blocking anyone except the flight crew from entering the flight deck. In an interview, a 777 captain has this to say about the cockpit door security measures:

>There is a door code you can enter which only the crew know, or you can press a doorbell, which prompts the crew inside the flight deck to check the camera and monitor screen to check who is trying to access the flight deck. The door and the locking mechanism are incredibly strong, bulletproof, and once locked nobody will be able to break the door down.



**Rothschild Patent Inheritance**

Freescale Semiconductor, a US technology company, had 20 of its employees on board flight 370. The right to a patent of a product, recently released by the company, was shared five ways - 20% to Freescale Semiconductor, and 20% each to four of the employees on board. This resulted in the billionaire Jacob Rothschild being the sole owner of the important patent.


**Diego Garcia**

Another extremely prominent theory is that flight 370 was hijacked and diverted to a United States military base on the atoll of Diego Garcia. The pilot had allegedly practiced landing on a short runway in the Indian Ocean on his flight simulator. Several residents of nearby islands reported that they saw a 'low flying jumbo jet' around 06:15:00 on March 8. They said that it was a white aircraft, with red stripes across it, keeping with Malaysian Airlines livery at the time of the incident. 

A resident of Kudahuvadhoo described the scene:

> ""I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly.""

Discovery of the flaperon on Réunion Island has renewed the speculation that flight 370 was shot down near Diego Garcia.




**What now?**

Following the fourth anniversary of the aircrafts disappearance, Malaysian officials have announced that there will be a press release this evening. I will update this post with any new information when it is available.

34,"How To Get A Pilot License In 4 Weeks Or Less                 
by Antony Woodward",23,19yvp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/19yvp9/how_to_get_a_pilot_license_in_4_weeks_or_less_by/,20,2013-03-09 15:51:30,"In this article I will discuss the steps you need to take to achieve a private pilot’s license in 4 weeks or less. You will see that with the right mindset and a few pre-requisites this goal is entirely realistic and will have the added benefit of saving you a lot of money while bolstering your self confidence and self esteem. 

Regulatory requirements for private pilot licenses vary from one country to another but in general a minimum of 40 hours of flying is required, a written or computerised test of aeronautical knowledge, and a flight test. A medical certificate is also required. 

Although I have held licenses from several ICAO member states, I have done most of my flying on validations of my FAA license. Therefore, I will talk about the aeronautical knowledge, skill, and experience requirements to obtain an FAA private pilot’s license in the United States. Federal Aviation Regulations Part 61 Certification of Pilots and Flight Instructors state that an applicant must meet the following requirements:

•	Be at least 17 years old
•	Be able to read, speak, write and understand the English language.
•	Obtain at least a third class medical certificate from an Aviation Medical Examiner
•	Pass a computerized aeronautical knowledge test
•	Accumulate and log a specified amount of training and experience, including the following:
•	At least 40 hours of flight time, including 20 hours with an instructor and 10 hours of solo flight.
•	5 hours of solo cross-country time including one flight of at least 150 nautical miles with full stop landings at a minimum of three points
•	Three solo takeoffs and landings to a full stop at an airport with an operating control tower.
•	3 hours of night flight training and 10 takeoffs and landings to a full stop at an airport.
•	3 hours of instrument flying training.
•	Pass an oral and flight test administered by an FAA inspector or FAA designated examiner.

A private pilot’s license allows command of any aircraft (subject to appropriate ratings) for any non-commercial purpose, and gives almost unlimited authority to fly under visual flight rules (VFR). Passengers may be carried and flight in furtherance of a business is permitted. However, a private pilot may not be compensated in any way for services as a pilot, although passengers can pay a pro rata share of flight expenses, such as fuel or rental costs.

Many people, for one reason or another, qualify for a private pilot’s license over an extended period of many months. This leads to a blowout in training costs. Then there is another group of people who like to accomplish their objectives in the minimum amount of time possible. Here is an outline of the procedure for those wishing to qualify for a pilot’s license in four weeks or less:

•	Obtain at least a third class medical certificate from an Aviation Medical Examiner. The medical certificate you will receive is also a student pilot’s license which allows you to start flight training immediately.
•	Buy a comprehensive ground school course which you can study at home on your computer.
•	When you are doing well on the practice tests and are feeling confident, make an appointment at your local Flight Service District Office to take the computerized aeronautical knowledge test.
•	After passing the test contact Fixed Base Operators at your local airport, ask for a quotation, and tell them that you have a student pilot’s licence/medical certificate, and that you have passed the aeronautical knowledge test and that you wish to complete your flight training in four weeks. 

If you come across a training outfit that tells you this is not possible, move on until you find a flying school with a positive and supportive attitude. You should also make it clear that you will be available to fly every day, weather permitting. 

There will be a few days that you cannot get airborne because of adverse weather. This presents an ideal  opportunity to revise certain areas of your ground course. You could also familiarize yourself with the Airplane Flight Manual for the aircraft you are flying. Many of the questions asked in the FAA oral examination are about the aircraft’s systems and performance. The other obvious reason for doing this is that you need to be knowledgeable about the systems and performance of the aircraft you are flying. 

•	This scenario assumes that you are able to finance the total cost of the flying and that you have 4 weeks available. Realistically you should allow for a 10% overrun. That is, budget on doing 44 hours of flying instead of the minimum 40 hours as specified in the FARs (Federal Aviation Regulations). The national average in the U.S. is 60+ hours. One of the reasons for this is that people flying only 1 or 2 hours a week lose currency which results in them having to repeat maneuvers in order to satisfy their instructor. 
•	If we assume that adverse weather keeps you on the ground for 20% of the 28 days you have projected, that means that you will be flying 44 hours in 22 days. That equates to only 2 hours flying per day on average. This is eminently achievable and more particularly because you will not have the stress of preparing for the aeronautical knowledge exam which you would have already passed  before stepping into an airplane. You are free to concentrate on the flying! I know from my own experience that concentrated flying results in a rapid development of self confidence.

Some years ago I was living on the Italian Riviera where I had the good fortune to meet an Italian crop dusting pilot who was spraying vineyards in Piemonte in northern Italy. He held an FAA commercial pilot’s licence with an Italian validation. He very kindly gave me the textbooks that he had used to get his commercial pilot licence at Ag Aviation Academy in Reno, Nevada. I studied the textbooks assiduously every day for about two months during the summer of 1969.  

When I believed I knew the subjects well enough I flew to Frankfurt where I took an FAA first class medical examination. My medical certificate was also a student pilot’s license. It was during the Frankfurt Book Fair and there were no hotel rooms available. At the main railway station I was lucky enough to meet a train driver who rented me a room, and whose wife provided me with some good German food. 

The next day I went to the Rhein Main Air Base where the FAA District office for Europe and the Middle East was located. I showed the FAA inspector my medical certificate and student license and told him that I wished to take the commercial pilot written examination. I had zero hours flight time but they weren’t concerned about that.  They gave me the exam paper, told me I had six hours to complete it, and showed me into the testing room. At that time pocket calculators could not be used. Basic arithmetic was the norm for figuring out the weight and balance questions. I struggled for the full six hours then flew back to Italy to wait for the Airman Test Report.  

After a couple of weeks of high anxiety I finally received my report with a passing score which was mainly due to good luck in getting the right questions rather than any innate ability on my part. The following week I enrolled in a CAA approved 35 hour PPL (private pilot license) course at Southend-on-Sea  at the mouth of the Thames river in the United Kingdom.  The technical papers were not too difficult because they were at a lower standard than the FAA commercial pilot written examination that I had just taken in Frankfurt. 

Most days the weather was not good with low cloud bases and precipitation – typical late autumn weather in the U.K! This meant having to deviate from the course line I had drawn on my chart to stay clear of clouds and in so doing risk getting lost. Most of the time I found it was relatively easy to pick up railway lines, roads, reservoirs etc. to help get back on track. There were a couple of instances where I became disorientated while flying to grass airfields with no nearby navaids. My instructor told me that cross country flying at the PPL level was supposed to be done by pilotage, that is by looking out the window and identifying objects on the ground, rather than by reference to radio navigation aids. It was all very well for him to say that as he had an intimate knowledge of the area, whereas I was seeing it for the first time in marginal weather. Airports such as Biggin Hill had a chaotic traffic pattern with tiger moths over from the Tiger Club in Red Hill spinning on the base leg and metal everywhere going in all directions. The  airfield was probably more orderly during the Battle of Britain with a couple of spitfire squadrons.   

I had some difficulty on the long triangular solo cross-country flight which was one of the requirements for the license. On the last leg from Biggin Hill to Southend I encounterd a strong crosswind on landing and had to go around. During the go-around I flew over a cemetery which did nothing to ease my anxiety. On the second attempt I crabbed to a touchdown and nearly sheared off the landing gear. The problem was that because the training was taking place so rapidly, my instructor hadn’t got around to giving me any instruction in crosswind landing techniques, and I had no idea how to do a cross controlled forward slip. 

The problem with my GFT (general flying test) was that they rolled out an aircraft I’d never flown before – a fully aerobatic Beagle Pup with a joystick. It didn’t give me any joy! The examiner commented that he would make allowances for the fact that I’d never flown the Beagle Pup. After I had completed the required maneuvers including spin recovery, he took over the controls and demonstrated the limits of the flight envelope. By the time he’d finished barrel rolling around clouds and performing chandelles all over the sky, I was feeling quite nauseous and regretting having eaten that steak and kidney pie closely followed by an apple turnover with fresh cream. I knew the flight had been satisfactory because he sent one of the instructors into London with the paperwork and an application for the licence. 

I started training on October 31, 1969 and took my GFT at Southend-on-Sea airfield on November 10, 1969. Total time logged was 37 hours and 25 minutes. The only reason I mention this is to show that if an average person, who is not afraid of a little hard work, can complete a private pilot’s license in 11 days then you should have no difficulty in doing the same thing in 28 days, especially in a place with fairly decent weather.

I know this is a wall of words, but read it anyway ... it contains several suggestions for improvement.

My current work assignment is a full time technology consulting project in Houston, so each week I fly round trip from my home base in Minneapolis. My return flight on Feb 22-23 was interesting, to say the least: https://weather.com/news/weather/video/united-flight-skids-off-icy-runway-in-green-bay-wisconsin

Yes, I recorded the video clips and that’s my voice you hear. The Weather Channel did a nice job editing and adding dramatic music. But that just shows the icing on the cake. There's a lot more to it.

My timeline of events:

We boarded United flight 878 IAH (Bush Intercontinental) to MSP on Thursday, February 22, 2018 about 7:10 pm with a scheduled departure of 7:40 pm.

The flight was nearly full, a Boeing 737-900 with 200 people on board. I was wedged into 21E, a middle seat in an exit row, between two guys who weigh 300-400 pounds. I’m not exactly svelte either, but these guys made me look small.

I showed the people around me how to turn off the seat-back entertainment units that would otherwise be flashing annoying DirecTV ads for the entire flight. Protip: Hit the minus button that dims the screen until it reaches its lowest setting. Every flight should include these instructions. Little did I know we’d be glued to those little screens long after midnight.

We sat for about 30 minutes, then the pilot announced there was a mechanical problem and “this plane won’t be going to Minneapolis”. The crew instructed us to get off and await instructions for a plane change. The United app notifications told me it was a problem with air conditioning. (8:15 pm)

I begged the counter agent to let me pay to upgrade to one of the several empty first class seats. Travel policy doesn’t allow reimbursement for this, but I’d gladly eat the $79 cost of the upgrade I'd been offered in the United app when I checked in. “Sorry. We have to keep them empty because the plane isn’t balanced.” My brother does weight-and-balance verification for another airline, so I understand this can happen. My brother later told me this is typically done when the aft baggage compartments are out of service or very lightly loaded with low-density cargo like flowers (he calls this a “fluffy load”). He also told me that when there is a plane change, he re-plans the loading of the plane from scratch. If those bins were not loaded due to a mechanical problem with the first plane, the load plan should have been revised for the second one.

Gate change. Checked again to see if maybe those first class seats were available, but no. Boarded plane #2 and pushed off. Same seat, between the same two guys. Because we were seated in an exit row, the flight attendants must ask us if we are willing and able to open the emergency exit door. The same attendant asked the same questions on both planes. The second time around, I jokingly asked her “If I were to say ‘No’, would you move me to one of those empty seats in first class?” She furrowed her brow like a scolding school teacher and said “No, then we’d have to open the door.” We all laughed and I said, “In that case, I’m a ‘Yes’.”

Plane departed IAH about 9:10 pm.

The tall 400 pound guy in 21D, who needed a seatbelt extender and spilled into my seat, said “You know you are kind of hot” (referring to my body temperature). I reply, “Thanks, I have my moments.” He’s actually a nice guy from Mississippi on his way to MN for a probate court hearing in the morning to settle the affairs of a relative who had passed away. Spoiler alert: he won’t make it to the hearing. I recall him advising us not to die without a will. Prophetic?

Scheduled arrival time at MSP was 10:40 pm but at that time we were somewhere over Iowa. I had slept for an hour, and that power nap served me well through the adventure that was coming our way.

The plane arrived in MSP airspace at the height of a snowstorm (~11:15 pm)

Aborted landing attempt #1 and we circled for what felt like an hour.

The plane’s seat-back entertainment units include a map and shows altitude and speed; I switched mine on out of curiosity. I wasn’t feeling very comfortable about all this low-altitude flying in icing conditions. Pilot announced we were running low on fuel and were diverting about 200 miles to Madison WI for fuel. (~ midnight)

The landing in Madison seemed harsher than average with loud landing gear noise and some twisting (crosswind correction?) at touchdown. Not the worst I’ve experienced, by far, but enough of a jolt to make a seasoned traveler go “Huh?”

Best part of the night … after we landed in Madison, the 400 pound guy in 21D jumped to the front of the plane and sat in one of the unoccupied first class seats. Nobody said a word and he stayed there for the duration of the flight! (Friday morning, ~1:00 am)

After refueling, pilot announced he has to be back in the air within 35 minutes or FAA rules will ground him and we’ll be stuck in Madison. My phone’s weather.com radar forecast showed the storm wouldn’t be clearing MSP until after 4:00 am, I recall thinking this might not end well.

We flew 200+ miles back to MN, circled some more, and aborted landing attempt #2. Pilot announced that runway conditions left braking distances too long for safety, so we were done for the night and diverting to Green Bay (it is now roughly 2:30 am)

My immediate thought: ""Why are we flying EAST? The storm is heading east. Shouldn't we be pointing at Des Moines or Omaha?"" Steady rain fell in Green Bay on frozen ground. Glare ice formed. There’s little-to-no air traffic at that time of night to report conditions.

If the pilot thought braking distances at MSP were bad, he sure had a nasty surprise waiting in Wisconsin.

During landing, touchdown was quite smooth. But I heard the thrust reversers at full throttle MUCH longer than normal and I also noticed the complete absence of the usual sounds, vibrations, and deceleration of brakes. I recall thinking ”Wow we’re using every bit of runway.” Then there were some mild bumps (like a car going over speed humps). The guy on my right looks out the window and said “Holy shit, were in the weeds!” I later learned we stopped 250 feet past the end of the runway. It was a flat and grassy field, and the ground was frozen solid. The plane wasn’t quite perfectly level, just a slight slant to the right. (3:15 am)

Pilot announced that we had left the runway and would be staying put. Stairs and a bus had been requested. It is going to be a while. A few passengers stood in the aisle, nobody seemed to be injured or even terribly upset. Emergency vehicles arrived on the left (port) side of the plane. The guy on my left said ""I am a huge Vikings fan. Why Green Bay of all places?""

I submitted reports to the news tip lines of two Minneapolis TV stations. A reporter from KARE (NBC affiliate in Minneapolis) immediately called me. I sent him video clips showing calm passengers and flashing lights outside, and he recorded an audio interview. His report was forwarded to NBC News and to their Houston affiliate KHOU.

Plane is unloaded. The bus had a capacity of 60, so it took at least four trips to get everyone to the terminal. I was in the second group. I recorded a clip from the staircase and sent it to KARE (5:00 am).

Crowd control was excellent at the plane, nobody could possibly wander off. At the terminal, we were free to roam and people were scattered throughout the terminal. One suggestion would be to announce a gathering spot in baggage claim where passengers can hear announcements. Fortunately it isn't a very large airport.

200 passengers milled around 2+ hours waiting for baggage and further instructions. United called in help and they handed out cinnamon rolls and bagel/egg sandwiches. I high-fived the 400 pound guy from Mississippi for having the nerve to sit in first class. I receive messages requesting permission to use my video clips, which I granted to anyone who asked nicely (free, perpetual, and unlimited use … sure, why not?). I was interviewed by Brandi -- you cannot make this stuff up -- Smith at KHOU, and she put together a nice segment for their morning news show. http://www.khou.com/article/news/local/houston-flight-to-minn-slides-off-runway-in-green-bay/285-522392079

About 8:00 am we were given the choice between a 5-6 hour bus ride to MSP or a hotel room for the morning followed by a 1:00 pm flight. I took the hotel and flight option, but 2/3 of the other passengers went for the bus. (Riding a bus across icy northern Wisconsin seemed particularly silly to me. Planes are much safer.) . I was issued a room voucher, $10 meal voucher, and a boarding pass. The hotel shuttle driver told me he was called in at 4:00 am and the hotel was expecting a much larger group; my guess is that United’s dispatcher tipped off the two nearby hotels to get ready for the full inbound jet before the runway excursion.

I slept for about two hours then returned to the airport at noon for the 1:00 pm flight. United sent what seemed to be a brand spanking new 737-900 to Green Bay to pick about 60 of us up. The cabin crew looked younger than usual (newbies that just finishing training?) but quite professional and polished. I had an entire row to myself. The weather was clear. The flight attendant didn’t ask for my credit card when I ordered a beer.

United has offered me the choice of a $300 flight credit that expires in a year or 15k miles. The text from the apology on the customer care site is below. Do you notice something missing? Zero acknowledgement that the plane left the runway. Zero acknowledgement that a mechanical problem with the first plane caused us to fly into the worst of the storm. Sure the weather was involved, but there was plenty of poor efforts that contributed. I think I'll pass on this offer.

“We Apologize

I can understand your concern when inclement weather forced your flight to divert to Madison rather than continuing to Minneapolis/St. Paul, as scheduled. Once we were given clearance to depart for Minneapolis and were en-route, I understand that, due to further weather conditions, an additional diversion to Green Bay was required and the flight subsequently cancelled.

Your safety is always important to us. I trust our staff was attentive to your needs and able to work with you in a pleasant, quick, and organized manner to offer alternate arrangements to get you safely to your final destination.“

But on the bright side, I survived a plane crash.

p.s. Hey United, the seat belt extender you gave the guy in 21D somehow wound up in my computer bag. May I keep it as a souvenir? Otherwise, you can come pick it up. I am usually home on Fridays."

The Sukhoi Superjet also called the SSJ was supposed to be the return of Russia to the civilian aviation sector after the collapse of the Soviet Union ( the Irkut project was started earlier but could not be produced until next year). However the SSJ platform has been plagued with problems and its tragic maiden press tour and recent crash has not helped it all. One of the biggest reasons for the failure of the SSJ has been its fucking horrendous engine the [Sam146](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerJet_SaM146). You see when the SSJ was announced NPO Saturn was chosen as the engine manufacturer. However NPO Saturn did not posses the technical capacity to make civilian high bypass turbo fan engines. So they partnered up with a French company called Snecma which was to build the high bypass part of the engine. [Well unfortunately for Sukhoi Snecma really screwed up their part of the production](https://www.airway1.com/almost-all-ssj100s-from-interjet-are-on-the-ground/). **The SaM146 problems occur in the so-called hot part of the engine, where fuel is burned. Cracks appear in the combustion chambers or oil collectors after 2000–4000 flight hours, and sometimes after 1000 flight hours. The engine must be sent to overhaul then although the manufacturer promises that the engine should run 7500-8000 hours before the first major overhaul.**

Azimut Airlines' three Superjet 100 out of eight have already suffered from the engine flaws, despite those three aircraft were new ones and have been in operation since September 2017. The other five copies joined the airline's fleet in 2018.

The experts don't know why those cracks occur so quickly. Safran manufactures engines for other aircraft. But the problem is only with the SaM146, although the suppliers of components are the same as for the rest of the product line.

**Repair of a failed engine costs from two to five million dollars and lasts around two months. Since this is a design flaw, the manufacturer repairs the engine at its own expense. But the airline itself pays for the rental of the replacement engine.**

&#x200B;

**Right now the situation is so bad that Sukhoi actually looses money if you buy and fly one of their planes.** Since cracks in the engine are appearing sometimes as low as 1,000 hours and since the engines are defective from the factory Sukhoi is responsible for their repairs.  So if you buy a SSJ100 and fly it around enough in a couple of months Sukhoi would have to do millions of dollars of repairs on it. 

&#x200B;

This is also hurting the airlines because the plane is completely out of commission while these repairs are being made. So you could have your entire SSJ fleet grounded. This has happened to their biggest customer outside the USSR which was the Mexican airline Interjet. They had 15 of their 22 planes grounded and now are selling their entire fleet. Sukhoi itself is not even manufacturing the plane anymore instead they are just focused on fixing the existing models.  But Sukhoi itself is pretty screwed because **the engines are failing in the part that was not manufactured or designed by them so they have no idea how to even approach the issue.**  While Smecma is just shrugging putting their hands up in the air and pointing the finger at Sukhoi. 

&#x200B;

The program has caused Sukhoi to loose a lot of money and right now United Aircraft Corporation only hope is to get to the bottom of the engine repairs while flooding the market with parts in the hopes that when breakdowns do happen spares are easy to get to and the aircraft can be back up and flying again soon."

39,Question: About maximum speed of civilian aircraft.,2,8b6lgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/8b6lgf/question_about_maximum_speed_of_civilian_aircraft/,17,2018-04-10 14:29:31,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently monitoring a flight that my girlfriend is on. But I've noticed that the speed of her aircraft is much higher than planned. She is flying on a Boeing 777-200 with United Airlines. Her planned speed is 876 km/h, but currently the airplane is cruising at 10.350m at a speed of 1145 km/h. A quick google shows that the max speed for a 777 is about 950 km/h. 

Is the increase in speed due to a tailwind? Does UA fit afterburners to their 777's? Especially since mach 1 is so close at 1234 km/h, wouldn't their current speed put a lot of stress on the airplane? Or is the extra stress mitigated by the increase in altitude? The planned altitude was also much lower, at 8.850m. 

I've experienced this higher speed while being on aircraft myself, but I've never passed 1.100 km/h. But then again, perhaps there is a difference in listed aircraft speed and ground speed? Basically, I'm wondering if the listed airspeed on flight monitoring websites and apps account for velocity, or if it is true groundspeed.

Thanks for any help!"

42,"Pilots, say a heavy Boeing is 350 miles out of the airport and all pilots are incapacitated, how would you advise the two flight attendants (females in this case) with ZERO experience and no experienced pilots on the aircraft to land the plane?",0,b5ndwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/b5ndwz/pilots_say_a_heavy_boeing_is_350_miles_out_of_the/,16,2019-03-26 13:03:20,"Nothing annoys me more than posts with people who barely know anything about airplanes except a few cliches and memes saying ""dude flying is so easy the autopilot will just do everything"" and its irritating.

First, how safe is it to have the clueless flight attendants flying divert to an ALT?

Second, is it even worth it to have them change frequencies UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY such as leaving a center to approach where it would most likely be the final freq change?

Heres how I would handle it.

We would request the attendants to forget checklists, and simply focus on flying. We would let autopilot and FMC handle the entire approach and landing. We would have them somehow find their way (after god knows how long and also pray they do this all BEFORE T/D), set their MCP altitude all the way down to 0 right away because lets face it we do NOT want them having to constantly switch the ALTITUDE on the MCP or theyll mess it up or lose focus, and let VNAV do the descent. Just for fun we'd ask them while they're at FL370 ""United 209 what is your speed"" ""omg we are going I thinkkk. it says we're going 250 miles per hour"" and we will sort of laugh because lets face it it would take them a full week course to learn knots and especially IAS. Modern airliners have auto speed restrictions set to below 250 at or below 10,000. We would not want to give them ANY radar vectors unless unlucky for us and more for the attendants, the final downwind leg may have vectors in which in that case we'd have them use the FMC to fly Direct to the base leg. As soon as they hit below 10,000 we'd ask them to slowly reduce speed to 210 and set flaps to 15. once they are downwind nearing base, we'd have them set speed to VREF for landing PLUS 30, set flaps to 20 (this is for Boeing as for Airbus the flap settings would be different but similar), and gears down right away to put that out of the way. We'd then let the LNAV turn to Final and have them punch in Localizer, set speed to VREF plus 5, and then select approach. Oh and wed sort of instruct them and hope they dont mess up arming speedbrakes for landing, and then set Autobrakes to MAX and upon landing NO REVERSE THRUST, stop on the runway because God forbid we trust them to exit the runway so lets just shut down the whole airport because they cannot do one small thing without messing it up, and hopefully when they come to a full stop after shitting on the brakes, we'd wait 2 more hours until they find the engine cutoff switches and shut the engine down (hoping the flight attendants dont quickly open doors and jump right into the runway with engines running. And I think thats how we could save the plane, which makes me think we really need remote control for planes.

But ATC or pilots advising via radio how would you guys handle this? I would say the less radar vectors and the more FMC the better."

If there is a better place to ask this then please let me know where to go.

I've wanted to be a pilot since I was 5 and so I did ROTC and joined the Air Force (USA) to become a pilot. However, due to a medical issue I was denied a pilot slot but was still able to have an aviation job working with military pilots. Well, 5 years later and the medical issue is no longer a factor, I got my flying medical, applied for pilot training and got selected! I'm tentatively leaving for pilot training in November. 

Now here's the rub and why I'm looking for advice. In the past year my attitude towards being in the military took a sharp nosedive and now the thought of being committed to the air force for another 10-15 years is pretty daunting. I work with a lot of reservists who fly with my unit and also for the airlines as their day jobs and they all say flying in the civilian sector is a hundred times better than in the military, and talking to them has really made me consider doing civilian flying. So now I'm wondering if it'll really be worth it to go to military pilot training or if it would be more worth wild to ride out my commitment to June 2021, and then go to a civilian pilot school and become a pilot that way. 

Pros about the military path: guaranteed job for the next 10-15 years, free training, sets up for success to fly in the civilian world. Cons: Rough on family, lots of additional non-flying related duties, shorter window before I'm flying a desk (I estimate only about 3-5 years of line flying before I'm put in a supervisory role). 

Pros about civilian path: No deployments! Primarily fly (minimal non-flying responsibilities), avoid military queep. Cons: starting over from the bottom (again), have to pay for flight training, poor opportunities for freshly minted pilots, lose military benefits (healthcare, housing, etc).

 

So that's where I'm at right now. Crossroads of life with two very valid but very different paths to take. Each with their own pros and cons, and no clear cut better decision. Anyone deal with something similar who can offer advice? Or can think of something that I'm overlooking or getting wrong? I'm about 2 months away from signing any commitment paperwork so I just want to make sure I make the right decision."

So why is the captain a ""hero"". Is that just media hype or was there actually something amazing that occurred that I am not getting?

So I don't fly a whole lot, but enough to have noticed something.  I noticed that when flying some of the big name common airlines (AA, United, etc), they seem to have a ""no rush"" approach to getting in the air.  Board the plane, wait a while.  Oh look we missed our departure time and we're not even out of the terminal yet.  Then we finally get on the tarmac and are sitting there in the worlds longest line before finally taking off.  

On the alternative, in my experience with Southwest they seem to be much more hustle.  As soon as everyone is on board the doors are closed and pilots are pulling away before the flight attendants even had a chance to say their spiel.  Hardly ever wait on the tarmac and typically round the final turn without even stopping before going airborne.  

Now I know this probably isn't a uniquely Southwest thing, given that air traffic and all kinds of other factors play into account, but is there something going on behind the scenes here that I'm missing?  

Again not trying to call any airlines out in particular, I'm sure Southwest has their share of delays and crap too.  "

> To whom it may concern,

> I understand the need to have company policies that insulate United Airlines from potential lawsuits, but exceptions should be made under certain circumstances. 

> Everyone is different, and bladders fill at different rates. Today, my bladder filled faster than anticipated (despite having relieved myself just prior to boarding). I waited as long as I could for the seat belt sign to be turned off, but my situation was becoming urgent. With my bladder status bordering on ‘emergency’, I saw a first class passenger use the forward lavatory with the seat belt sign still on. Since someone else had broached the subject first, I thought I was ok to try and use the bathroom. Both aft lavatories were occupied (or rather locked from the outside for taxi/takeoff, but the first class was not. Inconsistent.), so I went for the first class lav since it was much closer, and the only one available. 

> The first class attendant stopped me and said that the seat belt sign was on and that I could only use the economy lavatories. I expected this, and I tried to explain that this was becoming serious, the aft lavs were locked, and I would only be a minute. Instead of being compassionate, she informed me, quite rudely, and with condescension, that I would need to return to my seat. Instead I went to the aft lavs and pleaded my case there. The economy attendants, being more understanding of the human condition, opened one of the lavs while making absolutely sure that I realized the seat belt light was still on. I was very briefly thankful. 

> While I was using said lavatory, I heard an overhead announcement from the first class attendant reminding everyone to use the bathroom in your ticketed cabin (even if all of those are locked, and you’re running the risk of soiling yourself). She ended the announcement with “please be considerate of our policies”. 

> Having flown United hundreds of times over the past few years, and been seated in first class for dozens of those flights, I can tell you first hand that this lavatory policy is very rarely enforced. Come to the think of it, this was the first time I recall this particular policy being enforced. After witnessing such inconsistent enforcement over the years, I was shocked to be turned away in my hour of need. Especially after having just witnessed a first class passenger being allowed to use the lav with the seat belt light still on. 

> What are the FAA regulations on using lavatories during flight? When does a company policy supersede my right as a human being to have access to a toilet? Do flight attendants have any discretion on this policy (as I have obviously seen in the past)? 

> And perhaps most importantly, tell me why you deserve my business going forward? Why should I continue to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on United flights, instead of voting with my wallet and finding an airline that LUVs its customers?

> Instead of me being asked to respect company policies (by way of a public announcement made to the entire aircraft), maybe your staff should be asked to respect me.

> PS – I’m writing this while still on the flight. A fellow passenger seated in row 7, behind the bulkhead (in the economy cabin) just successfully raided first class and was able to use the bathroom without a word from the first class attendant. Why was I singled out? Maybe it was because the other economy passenger who used the first class lavatory was an elderly woman with a limp. Further proof that the lavatory policy is loosely enforced. 

TL;DR - United Airlines doesn't care how bad you have to pee.

I'm still on the flight (United's inflight wifi is pretty good). I look forward to their reply.

NOTES: 

1). All info up to date as of Week 7 2016 and as accurate as I can make it. All errors are mine. 

2). Teams coming off long homestands or homestand/bye weeks will have less flight data on FlightAware, or the flight number will have been reused for repositioning flights for other aircraft in the interim time between now and their last flight.  

3). Team flights to the UK are carried out by Virgin Atlantic, which uses Airbus A340-600 aircraft on direct flights from your team's airport to Heathrow. [Here's the Giants flight from last night](http://flightaware.com/live/flight/VIR9944/history/20161021/0041Z/KEWR/EGLL). Flight numbers vary for these flights but usually start with 994_. 

4). The Raiders use Airbus A330 aircraft from Hawaiian Airlines for all flights, Colts and Ravens use Boeing 777-200s for all flights. The rest of the teams use a mix of Boeing 767-300 & 400 models for long trips and Boeing 757-300 models for short hops, except for the Panthers and Cardinals who use Airbus A321's for their short hops.

One Lufthansa and one United.  Both were pretty cramped generally and seat width sucked and both adequately got me to my destination. But the quality of service and amenities on one vs. the other was just incredible.  From other flights, i can confidently say that any european airline is infinitely superior to any American airline, at least as far as intercontinental flights go.   

Euro airlines give you vastly better food, hot towels, smiling friendly service, free booze (and plenty of it), much better and more advanced entertainment, little treats when you land, and the flight attendants seem much happier and eager to please.

What I want to know is WHY?  Euro airlines are no longer government supported so they clearly have the same financial challenges that US ones do.  So how are they able to offer such an infinitely better product?

Any ideas? Anyone disagree?"

To set the stage: I’m currently an FO at a regional airline. My path thus far has been part 61 PPL, part 141 IR, commercial ASEL/AMEL (university), part 61 CFI/CFII, and then flight instruction as a primary time build. I have no checkride failures, however I do have one failed stage check from the 141 program (non-certification check). My resume has some pretty good things on it, including a 3.9 GPA. 

Now to present day. I’m chugging along as a regional FO, making decent money, and enjoying the benefits. However, I feel that I am unhappy. I commute (by choice) but when I’m home I feel like a leech. Like I’ve put all this work in to make it to this job and now I’m here and I’m like...ok what’s next? But I realize with airlines that this is it. Keep plugging away. Now the job is fun, but not having a clear goal to better myself, I’m feeling lost. 

Now the good stuff: I’ve been considering military aviation since I was a kid. I always dreamed of it. After balking at the idea a few times in the past, I feel like now I’m drawn more than ever. I want to serve my country. I want to serve a greater purpose and have a place in this world. I have flight experience, I have a clean record, and I’m 24 years old and in decent shape (working on making that great shape). I feel like military life would suit me, given that I’m driven and don’t really have roots grown, a girl at the moment, or a happening social life. Furthermore, I want or possibly need a goal that I can work hard towards. 

All of that in mind, what would the best path be? OTS/OCS and active duty? AF reserve? Find an ANG unit? I’ve done some light research and I’m still digging, so I’d like some real input here. To keep my regional airline job is 50/50; I like the pay and benefits (family pass travel is a lovely gift to them) however personally, I could forego this if it meant some prime years of my life being the best that I can be. So, Reddit—thoughts? 

TL;DR: 24 y/o regional pilot wants to step it up and fly for the military (fighters preferred obv but also obv wouldn’t turn down any pilot slot)"

Day 5 of 5

Last leg of the trip

Preflight ritual

Head up jet bridge to go use the bathroom

Gate agent tries to get my attention

“Hang on” gestures

move quickly in general direction of bathroom

Sweet relief

Examine dark circles under my eyes 

Sigh and splash cold water on my face

Starbucks equivalent is next door

3:15 pm

Obtain “not Italian for large” redeye

Shuffle back to gate

Collect paperwork from Gate Agent

Frantically trying to board because we are “behind schedule”

It’s New York

Everyone is always behind schedule.

Head back down jet bridge 

See CA fiddling with forward LAV door.

*What happened?*

*Damn thing just broke.*

Door is literally off its hinge because the bolt snapped off

Curse under breath

Drink very hot coffee

Call maintenance control on cell phone

*No company MX available at the field gonna have to call contract MX*

This always happens on the last leg.

As luck would have it a company bird is at the gate next to us

They have contract MX onboard. 

Shout on company freq; trade horses; MX comes over

Small victory

Drink not as hot coffee

A&P waddles on to airplane

*Yup, that’s broken*

[MFW](https://static.sketchport.com/images/twemoji/svg/1f610.svg)

Tells us he needs to make sure the door shuts before he can defer it

Percussive maintenance ensues

Preferred tool: the fist and boot

Obtains NEF; secures LAV door with speed tape; retreats to jet bridge with log book

MX guy pulls out Excalibur; slayer of on-time schedules and creature comforts

Looks like a ball point pen

Placards posted and logbook signed we are ready to go

Stare longingly at coffee before walking up jet bridge to tell GA to start boarding

You guys already know the drill

Program FMS; Close door; Run checklists

Gate hold lets us go right away

Awesome

4:00 pm

Pushback; franticly flip switches; add dead dino squeezins’; make fire

*One good start, cleared to disconnect*

Anxiously await taxi instructions as T-Storms are barreling into NYC

*(airline)(number) taxi left alpha and hold short of romeo delta. 
Call clearance on a second radio for new airways*

I was expecting this

SWAP routes in hand I call clearance

*I have all new airways for you. Advise ready to copy.*

Tell him I have the CDR’s in front of me

*Oh it’s not a CDR*

Reads off entire route, fix by fix, airway by airway

Looks at paperwork

New route is a published CDR

Heavy sigh.

*Expect one-zero thousand feet one zero minutes after departure*

Crap

Pray we have enough gas for this

Frantically type in route and send to dispatch

Drink coffee

*Route approved with a few thousand pounds of gas to spare*

Thank Cthulhu 

Tell ground we are ready to continue

*Taxi alpha, sierra, and join kilo behind United 767*

Start joining the conga line

Just before we turn onto kilo

*Uhhhhhh….. (airline)(number) did you talk to clearance yet?*

*Yeah, like 15 minutes ago*

*Let’s do this, (airline)(number) right kilo and hold short B. Second radio call clearance.*

[MFW](https://static.sketchport.com/images/twemoji/svg/1f610.svg)

Fix gaze straight ahead and read back instructions. 

Call Clarence again

Female controller answers this time

*I am working on your new route and I will get back to you in a minute*

Talk to CA about our mutual obsession with bourbon

This CA is much more fun than the last one

He’s even a line check airman

15 minutes have passed

Clearance frequency has been mostly quiet

Ask how much longer for the new route

Take big gulp of coffee

*Oh I’ve been waiting for you to tell me you were ready to copy*

Resist temptation to do a spit take all over the windscreen 

*Areyouf&@$!#gkiddingme‽*

*Ready to copy*

Reads off the exact same route we got last time

Fix by fix

Airway by airway

CA turns to look at me with his best *wtfisthisshit* face

*Uhhh ma’am that’s the same route y’all gave us earlier*

*The exact same route?*

*Yup*

*Same altitude*

*Yup*

*Well that’s weird. I am not sure why they did that.*

No kidding; me either.

Tell ground we have our new old route

Rejoin conga line for runway

Start other engine; run checklists; tell FA’s to park it

*(airline)(number) runway 22 right at whiskey line up and wait*

Salvation is nigh

4:50 pm

Cleared for takeoff

My leg

Set thrust; 80 knots; V1; rotate; gear up

400ft; FMS 2 active

1000ft; make go faster

Contact departure, G’Day

Flaps up; after takeoff checklist

10,000ft *ding ding*; make go even faster; drink coffee

Man this thing burns a lot of gas cruising at 10,000ft

Perform new fuel burn calculations

We will land with just over 500lbs of fuel over bingo

Just about 7 minutes extra of flying time

There are thunderstorms at destination

Thisisfine.jpg

Half way home

Somehow convince center to let us climb above 10,000ft

Climb and maintain FL240

Fuel burn is much nicer up here

Send for destination ATIS on ACARS

*27019G31 ILS 21L in use*

Heavy rain just to the west of the field

This is gonna be fun

Perform arrival and approach briefing

Brief CATII approach just in case

PAX PA

Descent checklist

Get vectored onto final 

17 miles out I can see the runway

Rain starts enveloping field from the west

10 miles out it’s hard to see the lights

Enter rain at 5 DME

Airspeed +/- 15 knots

Cantseeshitcaptain.geordi

Wipers to max

*Approaching minimums*

Still nothing

*Airplane: Minimums*

Simultaneously

*CA: Approach lights continue*

100 ft to spare

*Runway 11 O’Clock*

*In sight, landing.*

Raining so hard and so dark all I can see is runway centerline and edge lighting

Use the force Luke

Touchdown

*Spoilers Green*

Manual braking; max reverse; struggle to hold centerline

Manage to get off at taxiway tango

Heavy sigh

Flaps up; radar off; APU START

Drink cold coffee

Call OPS for gate assignment

*Uhhhhhh not sure what your gate is going to be at the moment. Ramp is closed due to lightning.* 

Great

Wait 30 minutes for storm to pass and ramp to reopen

7:10 PM

Taxi to gate; shutdown engines; say goodbye to pax

Turns to CA

*Thanks for the great trip*

*You did a great job, go home and enjoy a beer*

Go grab bags for CA and myself

Place bags in jet bridge

Flight Ops manger standing there with paper in hand

*Are you t3hwookie90?*

*Oh no. What’s up?*

*You have been selected for random screening. I need you to report to the testing center within an hour.*

I have a full-time job that I have full flexibility with my schedule and I can work from home/remote. I've been eyeballing airline companies for awhile. With all the flexibility of my new full-time job though, working in an airliner has always been on the bucket list. I used to be a Hotel Manager on the Las Vegas Strip and I had a few front desk agents moonlight for an airliner. Although their positions were usually low pay and they dealt with pretty upset customers from time to time, they put up with it because of the benefits.

So here is the snag that I keep running into. I've been checking job/career pages for the last 8 months (on a biweekly basis) on the following airlines: Delta, American, Southwest, JetBlue, Virgin, British Air, Hawaiian, United, Air Canada, Norwegian, and even the locally based Allegiant. I haven't seen ANY job postings for Gate Agent, Customer Service Agent or Baggage Handler (normally the only PT gigs I see offered at airliners) on any of their career/jobs sites. I see Spirit is looking for a Stockclerk right now, but that looks like a full-time position.

There are always hiring opportunities outside of Las Vegas (especially in Denver, Phoenix, and LA it looks like), but it seems like the door it always shut here. Is there a different avenue I should be trying or is the turnover rate for these positions in Las Vegas so ridiculously low that hiring is never a necessity? Maybe someone who works on the inside could add some insight? :-)"

I fly on it a lot (8 times so far this year) and think it’s a marvelous feat of engineering, I bore any one I’m sitting next to with all the epic statistics and love nothing more than watching that plane in the sky! 

My main issue with it is the windows, or more specifically airlines use of the windows! 

I remember my first flight on the 787 and was so excited with the window dimming magic ( the little buttons below the window that allow you to basically adjust the exposure of the window so it’s like wearing sunglasses, no more being blinded by that low lying sun). But recently I’ve noticed that airlines have been locking the windows in their darkest setting and leaving them like that for most of the flight!

I love flying and always want a window seat. I’ll happily sit separately from my friends, or be right at the back if it means I can get a window. But by controlling the windows and making it impossible to see outside for 10 hours it kind of ruins the flight for me. 

While I totally understand the use of being able to make the plane dark when on red eye routes when it’s best for everyone to be asleep but I was on a flight yesterday (a United flight from London to LA) which took of in the morning and landed in the afternoon and they had the plane in total darkness for about 8 hours of the flight. They served meals in the dark too! 

Has anyone else experience this? Does anyone have an explanation why airlines would do this? Other than keeping passengers docile and easier to manage for a tired crew.

At an airport like Seattle where several Star Alliance members have single daily international flights to Tokyo (ANA), Seoul (Asiana), Taipei (Eva), Toronto (Air Canada), and Frankfurt (Lufthansa), would airport operations for all these carriers be cheaper/more efficient if they shared check-in counter space and used a single team contracted to serve all the different airlines from that airport picked by that alliance itself?

I'm sure the operation at check-in counters varies between airports and certainly between countries, but it seems inefficient to me that a foreign airline would have it's own counter space that only gets used for a couple hours every day.  This would also be true for staff that support it --> Wouldn't it be more efficient if say, Star Alliance partners that only had 1-2 flights per day out of an airport would share spaces with say, United, that runs continuous service for multiple domestic flights throughout the day?  Like, they should obviously have enough spaces dedicated to processing all the foreign carriers during the few hours they needed the counter space to check in travelers but to also have the space revert to the alliance's most-flown domestic airline when these flights departed for the day?  LED-configured signs behind the counter could be customized to the relevant departure at that time, and then switched to the other airline when its flight was coming up.

Would this actually change anything?  Is this being done to an extent already?  "

I can't find the specific FAA regulation stating that children over 2 must have their own seat, but it seems to be common policy for US airlines (e.g. [Delta's policy](https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/gb/en/policy-library/reservations-and-ticketing/infant---children.html)).

[FAR 91.107](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2014-title14-vol2-sec91-107.pdf) states:

So was United in violation of the above FAR by having this 2+ year old child seated on his mother's lap?"

Not sure if this is the right place to post this; I would have tried r/whatisthisthing/, but I figure you guys are more qualified to answer. I’ve been compiling a collection of aircraft in flight found in Google StreetView, and over the course of it gotten better at identifying aircraft (particularly airlines). However, I'm still just as clueless on identifying propeller planes and executive jets. As such, I was hoping some of you could help identify these aircraft. These are Google Streetview links, so you can move around and see different angles as needed. Long list, but these are all the aircraft I’ve never identified. 

I’m looking to identify the aircraft type (and aircraft ID if you can make/figure it out) and airline (if applicable).

If the aircraft is too blurry, or the angle is bad, or it's too common a shape, or simply not possible to identify based on the views available, please also let me know!

About a week ago I posted[ this video on Why Flying is So Expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Oe8T3AvydU) which was pretty popular and enough people asked how budget airlines work that I'm making a video on them. If anyone feels like it, I'd love it if they'd look over my script and let me know of any mistakes they see, any omissions, or any other suggestions. Obviously most people here will know more about the topic than me so your input would be quite useful. I will, of course, credit you at the end of the video if I use any of your advice. If you want anything other than your Reddit username in the credits (or no credit at all) let me know. 

Here's the script. Obviously certain sections won't make sense since they're meant to be presented with visuals. 

**	Two weeks ago, I posted a video on why flying is so expensive, and, people seemed to like it, however, people wanted to know, how are budget airlines so cheap? Well it’s another complex answer but an interesting one. For the purposes of simplicity, and to keep our European friends from feeling left out, we’ll focus on the European budget airlines. While there are low-cost carriers in North America, and South Africa, and India, and Asia and plenty of other places, budget airlines really first stuck in Europe and that’s where they’re most prominent today. The magnitude to which airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet reduce the cost in Europe is also much more significant. Budget airlines in the US might be 10 or 20% less expensive than their competitors while in Europe a fare on a budget airline might only cost half or a third of what you would pay to a normal airline on the same route. 
	So how do they work? Well, unsurprisingly, budget airlines essentially take every possible part of the flight and make it less expensive to operate. The most essential thing an airline needs is airplanes, and believe it or not, it is possible to spend less on those. In the months and years following 9/11, the growth of air travel stalled and most airlines were simply fighting to survive. Meanwhile, Ryanair placed a massive order of 737’s from Boeing at unbelievably low-prices. Placing large orders gives airlines a bulk discount, and budget airlines will often sell off their aircraft a few years into their service life for not much less than what they bought them for new. The 737’s that Ryanair operates are very fuel efficient which saves fuel which saves cost. The fuel efficiency of new aircraft offsets the higher purchase price, so EasyJet, JetBlue, Ryanair, and Spirit Airlines all have younger fleets than any major airline. Ryanair operates exclusively 737’s and this is advantageous to them. Having only one type of Aircraft means that pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and ground staff only need to be trained on one type of aircraft. Training individuals on different types of aircraft adds time and cost to their training and also makes them higher skilled workers that can merit higher pay. 
	Flight attendants on budget airlines are often in the beginning of their careers and receive little training. Of course they will get the required safety training but little to no hospitality training. They’ll also often serve multiple roles. While on the ground, some of the flight attendants might go to the gate and check tickets while others will clean the airplane. Through this, the airline eliminates three or four positions that they regularly would pay for.
	Let’s talk about Airports. You’re never going to see Ryanair fly to London Heathrow or Paris Charles de Gaulle because those airports are expensive. There’s only a set amounts of flights per day that can operate out of those airports so supply and demand dictates that landing fees are high and slots are regulated. Instead, Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted, or Luton in London or Beauvais in Paris, which, by the way, is a 80 minute bus ride away from Paris, isn’t even technically in the same region of Paris, and has a website that looks like this! In a lot of cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only airline flying out of an airport which gives them huge negotiating power. They can ask for lower prices and, if the airport doesn’t comply, just leave and the airport will cease to exist. If there isn’t a viable cheap airport available, budget airlines also can fly to regular airports at less busy times when landing fees and the chance of delay might be lower. 
	Now we’re gonna get into the nitty-gritty—the small details. The planes of budget airlines tend to operate all day non-stop. For example, in one day, this Ryanair plane went from Brussels to Copenhagen, Copenhagen to Brussels, Brussels to Prague, Prague to Brussels, Brussels to Nimes, Nimes to Brussels, Brussels to Trevioso, then finally Trevioso to Brussels. Budget airlines will schedule only 30-45 minutes between the landing of one-flight to the take-off of another which often leads to delays and leaves very little time to clean the aircraft. This does, however, mean that the airplane is always making money and passengers are not paying for the time it’s sitting around. Ever wonder why Southwest doesn’t have reserved seating? Well by having a first come first serve system for seats, people almost always show up to the gate early and line up in an orderly line. This way, less time is spent on the ground and more time flying. Another principle of budget airlines is the point-to-point model. Most traditional airlines have hubs where most or all of their flights go in and out of. British Airlines has London, Air France has Paris, KLM has Amsterdam. For most flights on these airlines, you’ll have to connect through their hubs. Budget airlines, try to have a lot of destinations from everywhere. The cheapest budget airlines don’t even allow for connections on their flights. Allowing connections adds cost because then you have to pay for ground crews to transfer bags, create a more complicated ticketing system, and pay to rebook a passenger if a delay in their first flight makes them miss their second. Speaking of ticketing, there’s often no way to get a ticket from a real person on budget airlines. Ryanair charges 45 pounds if you fail to check in online while EasyJet and some other carriers have almost all their check-in’s handled by machines. This, once again, cuts down on personnel costs. At the airport, these budget airlines won’t bother using jetways because they’re expensive. They’ll use steps and just have passengers walk across the tarmac or take a bus to the plane. 
	Budget airlines simply make more money, if done right. EasyJet (11.15%), Ryanair (24.10%), and Wizz Air (10.2%) all had higher profit margins than Lufthansa (4.03%), British Airways (7.09%), and Air France (2.15%). Many of the traditional airlines have unionized workers with salary agreements that cannot be changed while the budget airlines can hire anyone and train them in a few months. It’s also hard for these traditional airlines to grow. Any route they make has to be one with a lot of preexisting demand since much of their business comes from business travelers. Since budget airlines are targeted more towards tourists, any destination that Ryanair, for example, opens up in will become a popular destination just because it’s possible to go there for so cheap. Some traditional airlines in Europe are opening their own budget airlines to get in on this profit. Air France created Transavia and Lufthansa created Eurowings, both of which are taking massive losses. What they seem to forget is that the US went through this budget airline within an airline phase a couple decades ago. Delta created Song, which failed. US Airways created MetroJet, which failed. United created Shuttle, which failed, then they went into bankruptcy and decided they should try again and make Ted, which failed. None of these worked! Despite this, it seems like everyone in the world is starting their own budget airline. The reason Ryanair and EasyJet are able to succeed where others have failed is largely because they are so large. They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands of employees, they have negotiating power that allows them to overpower competitors. In the end, for us consumers, any competition is good competition. Even failing budget airlines will bring down the cost of traditional airlines and allow us to travel the world for less.**

119,Story - Executive One Foxtrot,21,61pbpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/61pbpw/story_executive_one_foxtrot/,6,2017-03-27 05:31:13,"#Credit to [Ron Wagner on Quora](https://www.quora.com/Which-air-traffic-controller-or-controllers-annoyed-you-the-most/answer/Ron-Wagner-2) - felt r/aviation would appreciate it.

---

I was flying “Executive One Foxtrot,” which is the First Family. Three calls signs get special treatment, basically like being an emergency all the time, and those are “Air Force One,” “Air Force Two” (VP), and “Executive One Foxtrot.” They do NOT hold. EVER! Controllers are supposed to know that, ESPECIALLY a DC area controller.

We were going home to Andrews AFB in August on one of those horrid days with thunderstorms cells all over the place. We were coming in from the west, which meant we had to dodge all the buildups across the whole place to get to ADW on the far eastern side.

**INSANELY BUSY FREQUENCY:** When I came up on Washington approach control’s frequency, it was a mad house. The controller was firing off holding instructions as fast as possible to American, United, Delta, Northwest, etc. Machine gun words.

This is a complicated radio call, too, not short and sweet. It has to include a radial, a distance, an altitude, a direction and a time to expect to get out of holding. The pilots then, technically, have to read it all back, which would further tie up the radio. But these were experienced pros, seasoned enough to reply with not much more than “Roger.”

**BREAKING IN:** You have to carefully time your initial call on a day like this, so as not to step on a conversation. Very unprofessional. It’s kind of like jumping on a moving merry-go-round. You watch the pace and pick your place.

I listened to the rhythm of the calls and after about four sets of machine-gun holding instructions, I finally sensed a moment to key my mic, “Washington Approach, Executive One Foxtrot at eight thousand.”

“Executive One Foxtrot, hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.” The time was about 45 minutes away. I don’t know what else he said because I didn’t need that crap, because I wasn't going to hold.

“Negative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed to Andrews on a 140 heading, deviating a couple of times to dodge buildups, then descend on the other side of the Potomac and turn north into Andrews.”

“Executive One Foxtrot. Negative, negative! We’ve got traffic stacked up all over the area. Hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.”

“Negative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed direct Andrews as I said before.”

This poor guy was about to pop a gasket.

“EXECUTIVE ONE FOXTROT. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. IMMEDIATELY ACKNOWLEDGE THE HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEED AS DIRECTED.”

I figured I needed to say my call sign loud and very slowly so the supervisor on the frequency would hear me, jump in, and save this guy from himself.

“Approach. This is ***EXECUTIVE! ____ ONE! ____ FOXTROT!*** We WILL proceed direct Andrews on this 140 heading, then we’ll descend and turn northbound after we cross the Potomac.”

**THAT DID THE TRICK:** The next call was a different voice. Very deep, very calm, and silky smooth. A movie casting director would have hired this guy for the quintessential controller voice.

“Executive One Foxtrot, roger, proceed as you stated. Do you need to deviate while you’re on the 140?”

“Roger, we’ll have to deviate a bit left and right on that heading, but we can basically hold it until we’re south of Andrews, then turn north on our own. We’ll stay at eight thousand until we cross the Potomac. We won’t bother you folks with vectors or anything else.”

“Roger, Executive One Foxtrot, cleared as stated. My apologies for that, sir, he’s brand new to the DC area. That won’t happen again.”

He obviously did not want me to have the White House call him when I landed. It’s guaranteed that young controller never made that mistake again.

I always wondered what the airline pilots on the frequency thought about that exchange."

With the recent acquisition of Virgin America by Alaska Airlines in the United States, I came to wonder about some of the potential questions management and branding employees come to face in times of mergers and growth.

As it stands, Alaska seems to be taking over Virgin's route network as well as fleet (among others). The Virgin name will disappear, and Alaska will find itself in a very dominant position on the West coast. This is all fine and good, but I can't help but feel it being a bit silly for an airline situated throughout the West coast to call itself ""Alaska Airlines"". 

Geographic-based names and branding aren't uncommon of course, but they tend to be present in situations where a niche is being served and growth/competition aren't really present (think of Hawaiian, Air Seychelles, Air France, etc.). These brands tend to be able to get away with these names because of their niche, high-end, flag carrier status. More often than not, these airlines get subsidized by their respective governments anyway to allow for their operation.

Southwest is a definite exception here, but it can be argued that they really managed to distance themselves from the geographic name entirely by giving little focus to the Southwest U.S. at all. Many airlines like the startup low-cost long-haul ""Level"" from IAG chose for a name with no geographic ties to aid future growth, even though it will be based in Barcelona.

While Alaska Airlines has a strong brand in its area (which is more Seattle than it is Alaska anyway), I was wondering if it would be in order for a brand change? Picking up from where Virgin left off is a big task, and the trendy West doesn't really seem all too ready for their arrival. I'd figure a snazzier brand would be more in line with their low-cost aspirations. Not necessarily Virgin, but something a little similar.
I'm from the East coast, so thankfully I've still got my lovely JetBlue anyway.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Alaska Airlines should probably give itself a name/brand change to allow for a more smooth expansion along the West Coast. Agree/disagree?"

152,A historical review of geared turbofan engines,7,5qjytm,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/5qjytm/a_historical_review_of_geared_turbofan_engines/,4,2017-01-28 00:51:36,"A short research done on geared turbofans trying to document all known attempts. Images and data tables were cut out due to limited reddit formatting. 


There have not been many attempts at building a geared turbofan engine. In fact, only 7 distinct attempts could be traced. The very first geared turbofan which was also the very first turbofan to fly in 1951 was made by Turbomeca, a French company developed this engine and named it the Aspin 1 [6]. As this was the first turbofan produced, the term turbofan was not yet coined and it was actually referred to as a “jet engine with variable augmentation by ducted fan” [1]. The Aspin 1 was produced as a prototype and was used on two different aircrafts, the first being the Fouga CM.88 Gemeaux Mk. IV [2] a test bed which allowed it to complete 1000 hours of testing successfully [1] and the second, a prototype helicopter Dorand DH-11 [3] which produced less than desirable results and was abandoned. A year later, the Aspin 2 had it’s first flight on the same test bed [2]. Turbomeca did not pursue the production of their Aspin engines despite the successful results during the tests. Furthermore, the Aspin engines had a much smaller TSFC than any other turbojet or turbofan at the time, however it may not have been a considerable factor for manufacturers as there were no environmental law and cost of gas was most likely negligible. Additionally, it seems maintenance costs were elevated and the engine was somewhat unreliable though nothing specific was mentioned. Despite abandoning the Aspin engines Turbomeca did not abandon the geared turbofan.
 

The second line of geared turbofans ever produced were once again manufactured by Turbomeca. The Aubisque engine is a low bypass geared turbofan that first ran in 1961. No iterations of this engine were produced; however, it had managed to garner more interest than its predecessors, the Aspin I and the Aspin II. Approximately 300 units of this engine were equipped onto the Saab 105, a military trainer aircraft [9]. These units stayed in service for 30 years and were replaced by the Willams FJ44 engines in the mid 90’s. The gearing mechanism did not employ the traditional planetary gear system one would expect but rather a series of spur gears [8]. Following the moderate success of the Aubisque, Turbomeca made one last attempt at the geared turbofan.
 

The Astafan was Turbomeca’ last attempt at a geared turbofan. This engine had many iterations increasing its size and power however the none of them ever reached a production line. 
 

It is worth noting that all of the Turbomeca GTF engines were single shafts and ran at a constant RPM. Turbomeca’ plan was to resist adding a secondary shaft and a free turbine all whilst giving the engine the flexibility to change thrust by adjusting the fan blade angles and the fuel flow. This required pilots to have to adapt to the different controls and the way the engine responds. Furthermore, variable fan blade angles most likely increased maintenance costs and complexity. These two factors were most likely the reason the engines were not well received despite offering a much lower TSFC and produced less noise.[12]


The next line of geared turbofans is the most successful line in the history of geared turbofans. Developed by Garrett, the TFE731 and its iterations have had over 13000 models produced [13]. Early productions were done by Garett, following a merger AlliedSignal continued the production and Honeywell took possession of the line at the end [14]. The engine first ran in 1970 and its continuous success can be attributed to it’s low TSFC, its reliability, its low noise pollution, and its superior thrust to earlier GTF’s [14]. Furthermore, Garett developed the engine using the standard two shaft design which had more success in the early days of the turbofans. Furthermore, the engine design is mostly based on the TSCP700 an auxiliary power unit which proved its reliability [14]. The fact that the engine was built on a proven APU allowed Garett to garner considerable amount of interest. The TFE731-60 is worth mentioning as it is the largest and the most powerful version of this engine it also had thrust inverters included. Additional variants were produced with afterburners to further increase the range of application of the engine however the TFE731 name was not kept instead it was called the F124-GA-XXX and the F125X.
 

Lycoming was the next to try its hand at the geared turbofan. The ALF502 first ran in 1971, however it did not get certified until 1980. Problems with the reduction gear, compression stalls at altitude and a TSFC 10% higher than promised delayed the certification and the production of the engine [16]. Even after its certification the engine had reliability problems, due to early gearbox and bearing failures the challenger 601 opted for GE’s CF34. The BAe146 that kept using the engine suffered problems after problems from fuel controls breaking to badly machined turbine blades. However, BAe never felt any safety risks considering the airplane was equipped with 4 engines and Lycoming’ proactive repairs and customer service made them feel at ease [17]. Although the relationship between BAe and Lycoming was good, Airpac a regional airline in the united states was not nearly as happy with the engines. Airpac filed a 100-million-dollar law suit against BAe saying the poor reliability and the high maintenance costs drove them to bankruptcy. BAe ended up settling before the issue went to court and did not claim any responsibility, blaming the airliner for being poorly managed [18]. In the end, most ALF502’s was replaced with the ALF507, not much documentation is available on the ALF507 and it offers marginally better performances than the ALF502. It seems to be simply a more reliable version of the ALF502. The ALF family is the last of the geared turbofans developed until the recently announced PW1000G.

 

International Aero Engines tried their hand at a geared turbofan in 1987, however they never got past the design phase despite garnering a total of 104 commitments from aircraft manufacturers. In fact, the study was abandoned after only 4 months of research. IAE claimed it was a lack of funds rather than mechanical limitations that caused the project to be delayed indefinitely [20]. However, where IAE failed to produce Pratt & Whitney delivered.


P&W has so far successfully managed to scale the geared turbofan. They promise a considerable reduction in fuel burn and a 75% reduction in noise. They are also extremely confident in their gearbox boasting that no maintenance will be required except for a regular oil change [21]. The engine also boasts other new technologies that were overshadowed by the gearbox such as the fan made out of a trade secret alloy which allows the edge to be thinner than the carbon fiber counterpart providing a better aerodynamic flow. By improving the compressor and turbine blades design they’ve also managed to cut down on the number of stages required [22]. As of today, the only problem with the gearbox so far is in order to avoid thermal warping, a long start-up time is required [23]. Additionally, one of the PW1500G engines had a catastrophic failure during a ground test required to certify the C-series. P&W assures that the cause was not due to the gearbox, however they won’t say what did cause the engine to fail [24]. With two of their models certified, the PW1100G and the P1500G, P&W’s gamble with new technology seems to be paying off [25].

TL;DR: 7 distinct attempts to manufacture geared turbofans were done the first being in 1951. most never made it to production. The Aubisque and the ALF502/507 had relatively low success and the TFE731 was a major success. Pratts new engines will most likely be the next major success.

What I know for sure:

* United airlines

Pretty sure of:

* Flight bound to Washington DC

* Flight from Frankfurt

* Emergency landing in Amsterdam (in the evening)

* June 2007

The little I remember: We were told there was some techical problem, the guy next to me smelled ""burning electronics"" supposedly from the ventilation that I barely felt, but that was about 10min before start of descent. During the descent it surely felt like the plane was tilting way more than usually. Fuel was dumped. In the airport where we were landing it seemed like the whole runway was surrounded by waiting firetrucks (or other trucks but, all with blinking lights). A few passengers were panicking.

What might be the cause? Any way to find out for sure?

Would this not have simplified things and saved money the long run with maintaining them?   

So contrary to some critic's opinion's, I like United's A319/A320 configuration, including the slim Recaro seats - far better than their 737 and 757 product. 

pic:  http://s1182.photobucket.com/user/BeachBum1970/media/Airplanes/320slimline.png.html

I like the firm support for my back (I feel like I'm sitting with good posture), I get free movies and TV via UnitedWifi and internet browsing for purchase, and I even think the seat design with the grey and white is sleek and will probably age very well. This is a great combination and really all I could expect with a economy class seat. 

But then compare this to United's 737 fleet which I am really not excited to fly on - a lot of these planes have the old seats with DirectTV which I never want to use or pay for- these frequently lack power outlets/USB and are not noticeably more comfortable than a Recaro seat (even though they look more padded) - just more ugly! United is supposedly upgrading their 737 fleets now too with newer slim seats comparable to the Recaro on their A320's, but the design is different and really looks terrible! 

Pic: http://www.sanspotter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/united_airlines_san_sfo_trip_report_11.jpg

I've only flown on one flight with these new seats and they do not feel either more comfortable or like they will last very long. Will they be phasing out DirectTV with the introduction of these seats on the rest of the 737 fleets? The wifi was broken on that flight but I don't believe they have screens so will there be free movie browsing like on their A230's? Why didn't United get the Recaro seats for their entire narrowbody fleet? It seems like they're working great for them on their A320's and for Alaska on it's all-737 fleet.

I also saw the new first class product they're rolling out on their narrow-body fleets!

Is this a joke? The seats look straight out of a business class of a european carrier from back in the 80's. The tray table looks flimsy and the side pocket looks dangerous to put electronics in knowing what passengers let slip into the nooks and crannies of seats- these would seem notoriously difficult to clean. Also the area in between the seats as well as the arm rests looks to be at-best an inefficient use of space and tacky and cheap at worst. Why would United have gone with these designs?  They have so many examples of how to do first class right based on what's popular with travelers on other premium airlines.  This just seems like a downgrade to me. "

&#x200B;

(A little bit of backstory; feel free to skip to the questions if you'd like)

&#x200B;

Right now one of the career choices I would like to get involved in is commercial aviation. Since I was around ten years old, I have absolutely loved aviation to the point that by the time I entered high school, it was something I knew I would get involved with some day.

&#x200B;

My enthusiasm for aviation diminished a little bit when I was in high school as I took on a love for chemistry. This carried over to college, and I am currently a junior getting a bachelor's degree in chemistry. My love for aviation, however, is re surging and I would still love to be a commercial pilot someday. I wanted to ask a few questions about the profession so I can gather more information. 

&#x200B;

I apologize if some of these questions are vague or have cloudy answers.

&#x200B;

\-Questions-

&#x200B;

After completing flight school, what are the chances I get into a major airline right off the bat? I ask this since I live near a major hub of United Airlines, an airline I've flown basically my entire life. In a perfect world this would be my airline of choice. Reading their qualifications, I must acquire 1,000 hrs of fix-winged turbine time. So I assume this means that I cannot fly 777s right off the bat, but can I fly for a smaller airline somehow connected to a major airline? Or is there some way to obtain this required flying time with the airline itself? 

&#x200B;

What should I expect for salaries? I've heard rumors that co-pilots that start off right from flight school are dirt poor, yet senior captains for major airlines make quite a comfortable living. How true is this, and, depending who I work for, how does my salary change over time? 

&#x200B;

What are work hours like? A former neighbor of mine flies United 787s to Germany, but I thought I heard somewhere that he only flies a few times a month on these routes. I forget if he was a captain or FO if this makes any difference. Yet on the other end of the spectrum, I have heard horror stories of young FOs being overworked, flying upwards of 50-60 hours per week. I imagine it has to do with the number of hours you are limited to fly per month, but am not entirely sure.

&#x200B;

Lastly, is it possible (within reason, obviously) to have a preference on which aircraft to fly once hired? As an example, if I were to get hired by a major carrier that has hundreds of planes in their fleet, could I opt for flying a 737 or a A320 instead of flying a 767 or an A340? Or am I tossed on some plane and I don't have a say in which one?

&#x200B;

Would love some insight on this, as a career like this would really make me happy.

&#x200B;

Thanks!"

I am looking for a flight school in the United States. I would like to become an airline transport pilot, and I am currently looking at different options for the training.

I live in Finland, and here the cheapest way to get my EASA ATPL(A) is 59500€ (roughly 73000 USD). I am looking for a way to get a better bang for my buck. EASA and FAA licenses are roughly the same content wise, and the conversion will not be a problem in the future. Do you guys have any recommendations on flight schools? Location is not a critical factor, mostly just looking for a reasonably priced reliable way to get licensed.

I do not need iPads, weekend getaways, orientation weekends or any other useless crap. I just want to learn and fly with proper training. In my opinion the best school would be a down-to-earth (ironic, I know), smaller local school with experienced instructors.

Also, any tips in general regarding my future career as a pilot are appreciated.

Thanks in advance."

With the disappearance of Malaysian Flight 370 making headlines for the past few weeks, these questions will come up from time to time.

1. How much do GPS tracking units for aircraft normally cost?  (If such units exist.)

2. Based on the cost, who should pay for it-- the aircraft manufacturer on a per plane basis or the airline company?

3. How much more are you willing to pay for an airline ticket when an airline company passes the cost to the passenger?  $5 more per ticket?  $1?  $10?  $20?

4. Do you think that after this incident, the FAA and similar agencies will make GPS tracking units mandatory in the months or years to come?

I'm curious to read your opinions on this especially from pilots themselves and those that work in the airline and aircraft manufacturing industry.

My opinion: The FAA will likely make this a requirement on all US-based airlines or require it installed by the aircraft manufacturer, but time will tell.  Either way, the costs will be passed down to the passenger themselves and we'll end up paying for it.

Lastly, a real-time GPS tracking unit that communicates to satellites overhead is probably more realistic than the other suggested idea-- real-time streaming of flight data and voice recorders.  Why?  Bandwidth isn't cheap, and those who live in the US either with a cellular data plan or subscribed to a US-based ISP that places bandwidth limits knows this all too well.

Thank you."

For instance, lets say you have an airline with a brand new 787-8 and also a 767-300ER, and lets assume they have the same number of seats.

You have two routes, which are always filled to capacity: SFO to LAX, and SFO to NRT. Would you put the dreamliner on the shorter route, to maximize fuel economy when taking off, or does the majority of the 787's efficiency come while cruising, and so the longer route would be smarter while putting the lumbering 767 on the SFO-LAX?"

(Notably, two F-16s of the National Guard [planned to ram](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/f-16-pilot-was-ready-to-give-her-life-on-sept-11/2011/09/06/gIQAMpcODK_print.html) United Airlines Flight 93.)

Do any modern jet fighters have the avionics to lock onto and ram a target? In admittedly extremely rare circumstances, could it enable the pilot to eject before impact? Even if the plane were unable to intercept another aircraft, it seems plausible that engaging ground targets might be useful occasionally. For example, if a plane on a deep strike mission loses fuel or oil, and would be unable to return home regardless, it could crash into a depot or something.

Perhaps more practically, if a plane is going down over unlandable terrain, the pilot could target a preferred site before ejecting.

I think this feature would be too complicated to design, test, train for, and operate, considering how rarely it would be used. Does anyone know of an implementation?"

&#x200B;

*Hopefully this is okay to post here (please notify me otherwise and I'll delete it).*

We're a team working under the grant of NSF (National Science Foundation of the United States) to develop a real-time in-flight data recording technology. Our aim is to extend the usability of black box and provide real-time transmission of flight data. This would mean the aviation company can analyze the current state of equipment to find abnormalities or equipment failure.

There have been cases where analyzing a black box (Flight Data Recorder) was impossible including a few cases where black box was not found. A real time transmission can extend the possibility of instantaneous incidence response while providing automated solutions on analytics.

We're aware that equipment such as Data Acquisition Units (DAUs) are able to transmit data once a plane is landing or taking off, but our focus is on real-time data acquisition. There are many countries that haven't mandated DAUs and private planes (including non-commercial) planes in US are not required to equip DAUs or other data acquisition units.

Our current aim is to extend the usage of black box data for non-commercial flights, privately owned aircraft and small airline companies (including fleets). Mainly to increase safety standard which includes algorithms alarming whenever an equipment performs badly. Since proper functioning of only selective equipment is displayed, a real-time data transmission would alarm mishappening quickly and responsibly.

We're currently looking for opinions from those involved directly with aircraft or indirectly with aircraft (study, enthusiasm, etc). Opinions including whether we really need a real-time flight data recorder and how was your experience with black box.

* Does the continued use of *just* black box makes sense?
* How was your experience with black box? Was it useful in analyzing when and why an equipment failed?
* Would you like the idea of having a flight safety department (or flight operations office) receiving instantaneous notification of a peripheral/equipment failure during the flight?

I'd love to have a conversation with you if you'd like to share your experience or opinion on this! Please reach out to me, we can be on a call for as less as 5 minutes or as long as an hour if you'd like to add something to it!

&#x200B;

Thanks again r/aviation!"

Happened while climbing out, immediately started dumping all the way to the runway, but the plane didn't bother to try to get underweight by flying around for a while -- far as I could tell the gear bottomed out -- anyway, all worked out fine but I could never get a full answer for what happened (also, no free drinks either).  I've flown enough that I've seen a few things, but I've never seen flight attendants visibly worried but during this incident.  


Every now and again I think about it and wonder if it was a similar failure to UAL 232 -- I've written United a couple of times and gotten nothing, and I've checked NTSB, and since no one was hurt, there doesn't seem to be a report.    Not a big deal but it was certainly the sketchiest moment I ever had on an airline.  


Anyone have any suggestions for where else to look this up or figure out the whole story?"
216,Choosing a National Guard Unit that Aligns with Aviation/RTP Aspirations,3,cxalcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/cxalcw/choosing_a_national_guard_unit_that_aligns_with/,1,2019-08-30 06:09:12,"Afternoon everyone,

Was hoping for some insight for those military members who have hopped on the booming Rotor Transition Programs that seem to be providing a world of opportunity at the moment. 

For some background I am currently searching for National Guard units where I might want to serve as a commissioned Aviation Officer.  Looking waaaay ahead, I have begun to research the possibility of applying for an RTP and flying for a regional airline for my civilian job once I hit the required 500 hours of rotary wing time. One thing I have been wondering about has been how the hiring process goes once you are trained up enough to apply to the major airlines. Mainly, if I should choose an NG unit now that aligns with the major hubs these airlines operate in. I’ve been told that due to seniority new pilots at major airlines have little to no say as to what hub they will be based out of. It would be a bummer to choose a unit such as 40th CAB in Fresno and then get assigned to Newark by United. 

I know I’m asking a question that is about 10 steps ahead of my current situation, but with IST’s being a headache and having an 8-year obligation to the Army, I figured I’d try and at least be somewhat strategic when making these choices ahead of time.

Any input is appreciated. Thanks."

When I look up United Airlines flight 379 on google [another website](http://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL379) says that the aircraft was a 757.  Which would be right and why did it change.

* Qatar Flight 778 that hit runway lights on takeoff from Miami (9/15/2015)
* EVA Air Flight 15 that went off course and came very close to crashing into Mt. Wilson near Los Angeles in a storm (12/16/2016)
* Air Canada Flight 759 nearly landing on a taxiway at San Francisco International. It only missed the tail of Phillippine Airlines Flight 115 (an A340) by \*14 feet\*. If the flight would've continued descending, it would've crashed into United Airlines flights 863 and 1118; Boeing 787-900 and Boeing 737-900ER aircraft respectively with a combined 429 people on-board.  In addition to those people, 146 were on-board the Air Canada flight. This could've been absolutely catastrophic.
* The WestJet 737-800 that nearly hit the ocean on approach to St. Maarten a few years back.
* A Delta Airlines L1011 and a Continental Airlines 747 nearly collided over the Atlantic Ocean on July 8th, 1987. The L1011 flew under the 747 by about 30 feet.
* Allegiant Airlines Flight 175 (an A320) pitching and getting very close to the ground when an engine went out during a go-around in Mesa, Arizona (4/28/2016)
