0,"Award Travel: The bottleneck of churning, a rant after a year of non-stop traveling on points",69,95mhoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/95mhoc/award_travel_the_bottleneck_of_churning_a_rant/,102,2018-08-08 18:30:16,"The following is a reflection of my frustration with award travel prompted by aksurvivorfan’s post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/8xcnaa/discussion_frustrations_with_the_act_of_churning/) on their frustration with churning. Seeing as churning and award travel go hand-in-hand, this is also a word of warning for savy churners looking to transition into the next phase that is award travel. It’s not safe to assume the same success. The process of award travel is much more difficult.

My one year of traveling has come to a close. I haven’t traveled nearly as much as those who do it full-time, but I have spent more than two million miles on flights since 2017. This post is a reflection of some of the frustrations of the miles and points game that are often forgotten and omitted in posts on reddit and in the blogosphere. I went from being an avid fanatic of the hobby with barely any reservations to a huge critic of the many overlooked obstacles of award travel, especially the golden goose that is premium cabins that many, but not all of us, chase. After all, it was the first and business class redemptions rather than mileage currencies itself that got me and most of the people I know interested.

TL:DR: While churning and amassing a huge amount of points is relatively simple and straightforward (give or take the current rules in place and possible future restrictions), maximizing award travel can be quite the opposite, sometimes extremely time consuming and difficult to navigate.

I was introduced to the hobby in 2014 when, out of curiosity, I started looking up first class reviews. I stumbled across the blog, One Mile at a Time, and was blown away on how someone not much older than me was consistently traveling on first class tickets without travel benefits and little out-of-pocket expense. I finally was able to get my first “true” churning card in 2015 and since then have opened up several accounts.

But being both a full-time student and employee, meant that I had almost no time to travel. And when I did have time off, it was at most a week, two if I was lucky. This meant long haul travel was often out of the picture due to time lost in transit which brings me to frustration point #1:

1. You need time to travel.

Now I know most of you already know this as it’s nothing new. However, many of my friends who started with me in this hobby in 2015 are still sitting on the same treasure chest of points with a few redemptions but nothing significant enough to make a sizeable dent in their balance. The biggest constraint for them and many others was finding leave, which tends to be the reason why most people don’t want to do round the world awards that otherwise are one of the best bargains for miles in the business. My solution this past year was to no longer stay a full-time student and employee, which being young and without a family was an easier choice to make than most. But say you are able to find the time to travel, then you soon come to realize the next frustration point.

2.	Finding availability isn’t as easy with miles as with cash.

And this point here, tends to be a real deal breaker, especially if your time off often correlates to holidays when everyone else is off such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s. Or if it’s off-peak, but on an airline that only releases one business seat to partners (ie: Korean Air). Or there’s availability, but only far enough in advance (ie: Qantas or Air New Zealand), but too early enough to guarantee you’ll be authorized leave. Or like Cathay or Lufthansa First, where it requires you to be flexible enough to plan a week or two before your trip. Sometimes the airline is just plain stingy and doesn’t like to release award seats (IE: American Airlines on domestic routes). Another catch is that airlines don’t apply the same supply and demand algorithms to award availability that they do to the usual cash seats. Only a handful of award seats are allocated and then are released and restricted at varying times as you get closer to departure. Maybe it’s an oversimplification, but it’s usually an all or nothing type of ordeal. It goes from saver awards, to unaffordable standard awards, to no availability. Sometimes even in the reverse order.  It’s usually not the gradual change in pricing that you typically see with cash tickets.  Don’t even get me started on trying to find premium availability for parties greater than two. Sometimes you even have to find availability using another airline’s website (British Airways search using American Airlines), or there’s phantom availability, availability not searchable online (Alaska for Cathay), married segment availability (Qatar), and the list goes on and on. But say, you find the availability but as you’re piecing everything together online, an error message pops up. You call the airline up, feed the flights, only to find out your trip is significantly more expensive than expected or that the routing isn’t valid. Here we have frustration point #3.

3.	Your routing isn’t always valid even if it’s logical.

Oh boy does this require TONS of time and research. Especially if you’re trying to go for the real niche redemptions that can save you a bunch of miles. You have so many airline programs accessible with transferable currencies, multiplied by the amount of partners for each airline, and then some. This of course assumes that the airlines actually publish these rules yet alone follows them. Take for example the ninth circle of award redemption hell that is SkyTeam, save for Korean Air. The two most popular members, being Air France/KLM and Delta. Neither publish award charts to add to their already poor search engines. So you get awards that price out contrary to logic (IE: JFK-CDG-ZRH might be cheaper than JFK-CDG). My personal pet peeve is the maximum permitted mileage restriction since many of my routings to Europe require back-tracking by necessity not by choice. American likes to segment cap awards which really punishes those in small airports or prevents routing through third regions with certain exceptions. This is where United really shines, even with the introduction of the Excursionist perk/restriction, MileagePlus is still the most generous among the big three in terms of routing rules. I spent almost every day this past year researching on this topic, and every time I think I come close to mastering a program, I find something new or a program change renders some of my past knowledge obsolete. Say you cross all your t’s and dot all your I’s on your upcoming Etihad first itinerary. You find the time to travel, find the availability, and verify the cost and route validity. You can call American only to find out that they can’t book it nor find the availability. Thus, frustration point #4 is often overlooked.

4.	Booking awards isn’t always straightforward

The example above is caused by US based American Airlines agents being unable to see Etihad first availability, whereas certain call centers like Australia and New Zealand are able to find and book your request. But sometimes it’s not even technical issues like that. YMMV even with the CS reps themselves, especially with one of the off the beaten track currencies like Turkish. One of the top posts on r/awardtravel outlines the process in booking a second first class JAL award seat and it’s a great example of frustration points #2 and #4. It’s great to see how some of the top posts in award travel help breakdown these processes in simple and easy to follow steps to make frustration point #4 much more straightforward. It doesn’t help that airlines love to tack on fees during the booking process: fees for booking close to departure, booking over the phone, booking on partners, etc. In the end, all these fees (sometimes avoidable, not always) make award travel not as free as it’s hyped up to be. I’m sure you can figure out our next frustration point, since people love to advertise award travel as free travel.

5.	Award travel isn’t free and neither are miles.

There are tons of clickbait titles and misleading propaganda on blogosphere and especially YouTube vlogs about how they scored a $XXXXX flight for $5 as the main point rather than the amount of miles used to book the flight. Miles are definitely not free and even if someone offered to cash out my entire point balance at a generous 2 cents per point, I’d still feel short changed. There’s so many rules in regards to taxes and fees yet sometimes the only way you find out is at the final step of the booking process. Taxes and fees vary depending on the currencies used and the airlines redeemed and navigating these can be a huge headache. So while I can redeem 230K United Airlines miles for a roundtrip between HND-FRA in ANA first class for “only” $120, most people would agree that 93K AMEX points with a 30% transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic with $375 in surcharges is a much better redemption. So no, one doesn’t redeem first class ANA for just “$120”. Props if you’ve read this far, as we’ve finally reached the final frustration point.

6.	Information on award travel is not as readily blogged as churning information or trip reports.

I think it’s a shame that there’s more focus on how to accrue points than on how to spend them. At first, this confused me, especially when the latter is much more difficult. What’s the point of churning if you can’t reap the rewards effectively? The cold truth is that blogs and referrals receive commissions on the amount of credit card sign ups, not the amount of award redemptions. In fact, many blogs also profit by offering award booking services so having everyone informed, would be a loss of another revenue stream. I only started browsing flyertalk once I needed information for award redemptions since information on churning is readily available, at times over saturated. For example, there are tons of posts advertising IHG credit cards and how Intercontinental Thalasso is a great redemption of IHG points! $1,000 vs 70K IHG points, 1+ cpp! But there are almost no posts anywhere regarding how to successfully book award nights, even on flyertalk where it becomes obvious it’s a closely guarded secret. There’s a huge discrepancy of information between r/churning and r/awardtravel, and while I think doctorofcredit is the best resource for churning, there’s clearly not as much information on the website for award travel.

In the end, award travel may not be as much of a glorified hobby compared to churning due to its difficulty, but it’s definitely just as important. In fact, I still hesitate pitching churning to certain people who can easily accrue points and succeed in the hobby, but don’t know anything about award travel. There’s little use in collecting a huge sum of points yet unable to redeem them, only for them to be devalued year after year.

I know it might seem like I'm just a cynic and anti-award travel, but I certainly still support this hobby just hopefully with a little more research and awareness from current and upcoming churners.

Any recommendations?  

I've flown Delta and United before and I've been more impressed with Delta, but I'm located in NJ which means I mostly fly out of Newark (a United hub) and I don't really like how AmEx is declined everywhere.

2,The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend,13,4of6m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4of6m8/the_3_card_las_vegas_weekend/,73,2016-06-16 23:32:27,"##The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend
June 16, 2016

I wanted to share a Las Vegas long weekend trip I just booked when the opportunity came up.  This is something most people can do with a bit of planning and time.  I structured the write-up around a single churner applying for 3 cards.  If you are churning for two, the same trip can be done more efficiently with 4 cards.  You do have to hold one of the cards for more than 1 year, and pay a $49 annual fee.

### The Cards involved

- Chase Sapphire Preferred/Chase British Airways (30K UR/Avios)
- AmEx Starwood Preferred (20K SPG Starpoints)
- Chase IHG (60k IHG AND 1 Annual Free Night after 1 year)

### Booking the Trip

The genesis of the trip was a SPG Moments offer: for 20K SPG points, you can get premium seats for two at a concert at Caesar’s Palace.  This was something we were looking to do over the summer, so having it pop-up was perfect.  It’s unclear what “Premium” seats mean, but decent seats for the concert runs $2-300 per ticket.  So the 20K SPG points is redeeming for something between $4-600 in value.  Flyertalk search showed one report of the seats being in the 8th row, which would indeed be pretty good seats.

**UPDATE** SPG has gotten back to me with the seats.  They are in the orchestra section, and tickets for that section are going for $430 a piece.  So the 20K SPG points bought $860 worth of tickets. 

Las Vegas hotels discounts heavily on a regular basis, so folks often find the best value by just booking a discount rate.  When I started looking at hotels, I start with awardmapper.com.  None of the rates really looked appealing, but as I looked deeper, the Venetian and Palazzo are Intercontinentals, and award nights is priced at 60K.  This means that 2 nights there would be 60K IHG points for the first night, and an annual free night certificate (second night) if you hold the IHG card for a year and pay the $49 AF.  The better plan would be using two annual free night certificates, which I happen to have available.  Booking this was very easy, just login into your IHG account, and use the Book Free Night functionality.  When I looked, the rate per night is $300 at the Palazzo.  So signing up for the IHG card, paying the AF of $49 for the second year, will redeem for a value around $600.  Note, even if the hotel discounts 50%, you are still looking at a $300 redemption.  BTW, I found out afterwards that the hotels are all suites, with 720 sq ft in their standard rooms.  There is a $32 per night Resort fee that needs to be paid on award stays as well, but rumour is that there is a way to get out of it.  Reports also show that IHG Platinum and Spire Elites status means little to nothing at these hotels, so don’t expect an upgrade based on these statuses.  Royal Ambassador does get the expected recognition.

Last step, how to get to Las Vegas.  From Seattle to Las Vegas is just under 1,000 miles, which means if I redeemed Avios from a Chase BA card, or transfer points from UR to Avios, I would spend 30K points for two RTs.  To book, I would use AA.com, and search for awards costing 12.5K AA miles.  I can find award flights on Alaska Air at that redemption cost for both days, and write down the flight numbers.  I would then call BA directly, and booked these flights, as you cannot book Alaska awards on BA.com.  I did all these searches, and seats were available, but the timing of the return flight was atrocious, something to be aware of when looking at award flights.

Note that I describe how it can be done with a CSP or BA Avios card.  In my case, I chose to save my points.  The actual flights at more preferred times on this trip cost about $200 per person.  I also have an Alaska Air companion pass from the Alaska Air card, which makes the 2 RTs cost around $340.  As I value 30K of Avios/UR more than $340, I decided it was more valuable for me to save the points and pay for the flights.  This is purely a personal decision, and only you can decide whether paying for the flights, or using points is a better deal.

Now, what if Alaska air is not a useful redemption from where you live?  The Chase UR points can be transferred to United or Flying Blue, and you can redeem United or Delta award flights.  If your preferred airline is Southwest, then a Chase Southwest card with the 50K sign-up bonus, would very likely get two of you to Vegas with 1 card.  If you get the Companion Pass, it would further halve the cost.

### Takeaways

First of all, this is a pretty simple redemption.  Other than the BA award, you can do everything online.  Secondly, with just 3 cards, you can get a nice little weekend getaway without having to worry about MS or other complexities, and you will likely have some points leftover.  The only gotcha is that you need to get the IHG card, and hold it for a year to get the free annual night.  The ability to redeem at almost all IHG properties make the $49 AF an absolute bargain if you plan any IHG hotel stays over the course of a year.

Next, SPG Moments offer a different dimension on how to use points.  Other than just free nights or airline tickets, you can get some pretty interesting redemptions, such as boxed seats to sporting events, concerts tickets, or even mingling with players at a ball park.  This alone is a pretty good reason to keep on channeling un-bonused spend onto the AmEx SPG card.

Lastly, point valuation is very personal.  Some folks value getting as many free trips as possible, while some may see points as opening doors to premium travel that you wouldn’t really want to pay for in cash.  There is no right answer here.  Whatever works for you, is the best answer.

3,Chase Ultimate Rewards? Why is everything more expensive?,33,ayl4wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/ayl4wy/chase_ultimate_rewards_why_is_everything_more/,77,2019-03-08 05:39:53,"I've been a Chase Sapphire preferred holder since the card was first introduced.  I've tried several times to book trips on there while getting the value for my points and it's rather frustrating.    


Tonight I was looking at flights to Hawaii and a few things jumped out at me (also please note it's been this way for a dozen plus trips I've tried to book with them):  
1) Prices are about $50 higher than booking with the airline directly, that fluctuates a little by airline but generally its about $50/ticket each way, I prefer to book united and they were $52 more expensive.

2) On top of being more expensive I am unable to select my fare, so it's Economy Basic, which might be ok, but I prefer regular Economy which allows for carry-on.  Traveling with the wife and two kids one or two carry on bags will be necessary.  

3) Rental cars and hotels are the same way, the markup on rental cars is just ridiculous.  20-40% depending on the company.    


I could transfer points direct to United and wait for deals, but that's tough with a family and coordinating schedules in a manner that's best for school so that's not really practical for me.    


Now it is true that with my 25% points savings, booking through Chase is about 14% cheaper than booking through united, but it should be 25%.  I'm basically saving a negligible amount on travel.    


The final point I'll make, is booking through Expedia, or another similar site savings significantly more than booking with the credit card through UR or other method.    


Anything else I can do?  If the travel awards simply aren't worth it, it may be time to find a better card and just focus on Cashback.  "

This was a loooooong process that I'm happy to be over with, and I wanted to share our ridiculous itinerary and my experience planning and booking this trip.

We got a little of everything in this itinerary from a redemption standpoint: ANA RTW, a ridiculous redemption through the Chase portal, a three-night stay at everyone’s favorite RC Kyoto at the discounted rate, and some questionable single leg bookings. Please read about the process below before commenting on how dumb I was with some of these redemptions :)

**Step One: Planning the Redemptions and Utilizing Marriott’s Hotel + Air Redemption**

Planning how to make this trip possible seemed to change about every other week. As mentioned, this was our first time doing something like this, so I was learning as I was planning. Based on what points and miles we had collected (and what we planned to collect), I planned on the following: Marriott bookings for Tokyo and Kyoto, Chase UR for either Santorini or the Maldives and cash for the other, and a mixture of redemptions through United, Singapore, and/or Turkish of varying classes for the flights (I hadn’t really planned Osaka, Hiroshima, or Miyajima at this point since they were all one night stays). I used the Marriott Hotel + Air package available before the merger to book seven nights in Tokyo and transfer 120k miles to United. At some point (thanks to this subreddit!) I learned about ANA Round the World. We would save a ton of miles and fly biz class across the board at the same time! Unfortunately, there were less than nine months until the trip, and we had essentially nothing in MR. 

**Step Two: Booking the Main Hotel Stays**

While we worked on churning MR for the RTW tickets, I focused on booking our hotel stays. As mentioned, I used the Hotel + Air package for seven nights in Tokyo, and Kyoto was easy enough to figure out; with the category 8 redemption cost not taking effect until March 2019, three nights at the Ritz Carlton at 60k per night was a no brainer. 

My original plan was to stay in Santorini using Chase UR (as they do not really have any big international chains on the island) and use cash to pay for our nights in the Maldives at whatever resort we preferred. I never really considered Hilton points for the Conrad, as we didn’t have time to churn through those cards while prioritizing MR for the RTW tickets. After some research, we decided on Canaves Oia Suites for Santorini and either Huvafen Fushi or Anantara Kivanah for the Maldives. Back before the Chase portal change to be straight up Expedia, though, the hotel we wanted for Santorini wasn’t available, so this got swapped around. We had enough Chase points to cover four nights in the larger (and more expensive) overwater ocean bungalows at HF, and I read on Trip Advisor they have one of if not the best reefs for snorkeling in the Maldives, so I booked both of these using cash and a ton of Chase UR respectively. I know some of you may gawk at using so much UR for four nights, but staying in our number one choice is worth it for us. Churn and burn!
After all that, we did have some Hilton points sitting around that would cover a night in Osaka, but our Marriott points were depleted by the time I got around to Hiroshima and Miyajima. We wanted to try a night at a ryokan for Miyajima anyways, so I used our remaining Chase points for both of these.

**Step Three: Making ANA RTW Work**

Three Amex cards later, we finally had enough MR for two business class ANA RTW tickets. Unfortunately, it was December by the time all the bonuses had posted, and some previous availability had dried up while our dates were more or less set in stone (I really did not want to rework the entire itinerary at this point or bother with rebooking our hotels for different dates). By focusing on TAP Portugal, I was able to find some overseas flights to Europe in J for the first leg, and the last leg from Tokyo to the US wasn’t too hard to find; there were a handful of Asiana options, but I found a United flight with the new 1-2-1 Polaris layout and went with that. The difficult legs were to and from the Maldives. Getting from Male to Osaka wasn’t too difficult, just kinda wonky, but I couldn’t find anything for the inbound leg from Athens. Ultimately, I said screw it and used our AA miles (which aren’t hard to come by anyways) to get from ATH to DOH to MLE on Qatar. It cost 85k miles and little in surcharges but saved us 40k ANA miles and whatever the surcharges would’ve been, so it wasn’t a huge loss. Plus, the additional 45k miles may be worth it for Qatar; their J class looks awesome! I’m excited for our second leg, as it’s the QSuites product. 

You’ll notice from our itinerary, though, inbound and output flights for both Birmingham and Santorini were not included as well as MLE to BLR. As for BHM, there just wasn’t much availability that fit our schedule (as we had to depart Thursday night after work and return the Monday we left Tokyo; Denver was as far as we could get on the return trip). There were some options from Athens to Santorini and vice versa, but the flights were either really early or really late and included about $50 in surcharges per person per flight. Since flights to and from Santorini are cheap anyways, I decided using alternative means would provide more flexibility to enjoy our three night stay. MLE to BLR was supposed to be part of our RTW itinerary, as it was available when I pieced it together on the phone with the ANA agent, but when I called back a few days later to finalize the booking after the points had transferred, Air India flights were no longer available via ANA for some reason, so I covered it with United miles.

**Step Four: Filling in the Gaps**

After the RTW tickets were booked, here’s what was left: getting from BHM to EWR, a hotel stay in Newark, a hotel stay in Athens, getting from Athens to Santorini and back, and getting from Denver to BHM. We had just enough Hilton points to cover a stay near the airport in Newark, so that was taken care of right off the bat. My CSR travel credit posted sometime in February, so I used that for the stay at the hotel near Athens airport; there were cheaper options, but it was convenient and would ensure we could get to bed as quickly as possible off our flight and sleep in a bit if possible to help with jet lag. We also faced spending the night in Doha airport, and even though it wasn’t really necessary, we decided to use my remaining CSR credit and cash to cover a stay at the airport hotel to ensure we would be as rested as we could be on our way to the Maldives. Given it was our honeymoon and we still had money set aside for flights and hotels, we put aside the idea of maximizing value or saving a few hundred more dollars to prioritize convenience and rest. 

All that was left at this point were those remaining legs. This is where I messed up. I had that extra 120k United miles sitting around from the Hotel + Air package, and I was eager to put this all to bed. There was only one option from Denver to Birmingham via United miles anyways, so I forked over 22k a piece to get home. I had used all our Amex airline credits for AA gift cards to get us to NYC, but I did not factor in that the AA flights available did not fly into EWR and we’d be landing late at night. I didn’t want to deal with trying to get to Newark at 1 AM, so I changed plans and transferred Amex to Delta so we could land there and go straight to the hotel (I wanted us to hit the bed as early as possible to try to adjust for the upcoming time difference by waking up early). I went ahead and booked us seats in Comfort+ because why not, it wasn’t that many extra miles and I’m tall, and now I have a bunch of AA gift cards. 

Meanwhile, I kept checking on flights to and from Santorini. I prioritized Olympic, as we’d have two heavy pieces of luggage to check and the budget airlines would bleed us dry after that was factored in. I wanted early afternoon flights for both trips, but all flights around that time were $150 per person. There was an outbound flight available that could be booked via United miles for 8k per person and fees, though, so I went ahead and booked that. Nothing good was available for the inbound trip, so I checked every day for a month until prices dropped. I finally got one for $131 total that included checked luggage, which was great! But then I checked on the outbound flight, and it had also dropped in price to $45 per person, meaning I spent 16k miles and fees for what would’ve been $90. I checked the DEN to BHM flight as well, and it had also decreased in cost both for cash and points. So that whole ordeal was a waste of United miles, but at least it was all small scale and everything was booked.  

**Final Notes**

Congrats if you made it this far! I tried to be as succinct as possible, but there was a lot going on with this itinerary. Some of the redemptions weren't the best, and we could've gotten a lot more value for our points in the long haul if we didn't go absolutely bonkers with it, but I know that we are going to have the trip of a lifetime! In retrospect, given the limited time frame (all the churning happened in less than two years), there's not much I would change. I definitely would have prioritized the ANA RTW tickets first to improve what legs were available, and I'd want a do-over on booking those small legs at the end, but that's about it really! **A huge thanks to this sub for helping make this possible!** I have no idea what this trip would've been without all the advice and information I got from here.

EDIT: Forgot to include this in the original post, but we'll be staying 3 nights in Santorini, 4 nights in the Maldives, and 13 nights in Japan, with one night stops in Newark, Athens, and Doha between flights. We'll be gone for 25 days total including flights. 

EDIT 2: Adjusted redemption table for the DEN -> BHM leg to reflect the price decrease I mentioned; $750 was the price at the time of booking, it has since gone down."
5,Notes on ANA award ticket via Virgin Atlantic,44,c3ptyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c3ptyf/notes_on_ana_award_ticket_via_virgin_atlantic/,73,2019-06-22 17:41:44,"I didn't see this information in any blogs describing Virgin Airlines Award tickets, I hope it will be helpful:

* When I called VS to book an award ticket, first time I used regular contact number (+1 800 862 8621) and agent had no clue how to find open award tickets, she said there is no availability on the day I needed (United showed plenty of availability). HUCA, used Flying Club support number (+1 800 365 9500), agent found seats quickly. Interestingly all phone menu options are the same for both numbers, I don't think they lead to different teams. Probably HUCA helped.
* VS didn't charge me $$ for a date and a ticket class change I did two weeks after the original booking. I thought it's going to be $50 per person. Not sure if they forgot to, or they don't charge for partner tickets change. If latter, this is good to know, adds a lot of flexibility. Please share your experience.
* Ticket class change from Business to First didn't lead to increased surcharges. They were $266/pp (west coast - tokyo - west coast) and this amount didn't increase, just extra 10k miles per person, per segment.
* Citi, Chase, and AmEx points transfer is truly instant, it was done while I was on a call with agent - didn't have to put tickets on hold and call back, like many blogs/posts recommend.

Overall very pleasant experience."

Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say “Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what?”

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program’s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program’s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline’s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won’t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don’t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE’s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR’s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let’s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don’t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are “Savers” awards, and “Anytime” awards.  

“Savers” are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline’s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

“Anytime” are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I’m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay’s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it’s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It’s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United’s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let’s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don’t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won’t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don’t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can’t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don’t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven’t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let’s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline’s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like “Use Miles”.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let’s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn’t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline’s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people’s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for “Mixed Class”, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can’t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let’s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it’s own, but I’ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people’s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don’t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline’s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip…

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can’t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You’ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don’t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you’ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state “On Request”.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to “Ticketed”.  In the past, I’ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline’s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline’s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don’t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn’t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don’t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

##What is next?

There are tons of topics we did not cover in this Basics guide.  How to transfer Points, how to actually search for rewards, how to determine which FF to use, etc.  Let me know what topics you would like to see me cover in the future.

-----------------

My wife is currently in the middle of finishing a residency program which has severely limited our ability to travel. Her program ends in mid-July, with a full time position not starting until the beginning of September. We saw this as a golden opportunity for us to travel and for her to be able to spend a bunch of time with her family in Turkey.

The itinerary was dictated by a few things: my brother just started a job in Tokyo last week, so we're spending seven nights there to start the trip off. The nonstop ANA flight to NRT made this an obvious starting point, although I was pondering flying EVA IAH-TPE-TYO since I really wanted to fly EVA J. Unfortunately award availability, timing, and the fact that it would have been an extra 20k MR each make us stick with Tokyo first. I'm still hoping to do an IAH-TPE-TYO-IAH redemption using ANA miles sometime in 2019.

Next, we decided on Bangkok since I've wanted to visit Thailand for a while. We'll be spending a few days there before continuing onto Koh Samui. Originally we were thinking Phuket, but the fact that we had a couple Ritz certificates that hadn't been earmarked for anything led us to Koh Samui. We'll be spending six nights there, splitting our time between the Ritz Carlton and the Conrad.

The only Star Alliance flight that operates out of USM is the TG flight we're coming in on, so we booked 2x SilkAir economy tickets using 25,000 SQ miles and $47. I was happy to find availability since the cash prices were pretty nuts (over $300 per person for a one way).

In Singapore we'll be using some IHG certificates to book the Singapore InterContinental for a few nights, before boarding a (luckily 1-2-1 refitted) SQ 777-200 to fly to Istanbul.

I'll be spending about a week in Turkey with my wife's family before heading out. I am already taking a crazy amount of time off work, so pushing it too much longer would have been problematic. This is where I ran into the biggest issues with availabilty that Europe-NA availabilty was pretty limited. I could have flown IST-IAH nonstop in TK J, but I've now flown that product quite a number of times so I really wanted to try something new. 

Ideally I wanted to fly an airline whose business class I hadn't tried before and that wouldn't kill me with YQ. That excludes OS, LH and LX. SN had zero availability, as did UA (except for a 767 out of GVA). TP would have blown my mileage count up diverting to LIS. 

So that basically left SK and AC. I originally found some space IST-BRU-YUL-IAH in all business class. I was very excited since I hoped to build in a day or two to see a friend who lives in Belgium. Unfortunately the YUL-IAH space was only bookable by Aeroplan and ANA couldn't see it. Not having any good options back from YUL and with the same problem for all non-mainline AC flights to IAH (basically all of them) I settled on SK. There was some space CPH-IAD on an A340, which is a plane that has always fascinated me. 

Unfortunately I then ran into some problems with TK space that I've encountered with some of their shorthaul routes before: they tend to just pop in and out of existence in the Star Alliance award reservation system. Even though there are multiple IST-CPH flights per day from both IST and SAW, there were exactly zero Y or J award seats for the entire month showing up in the system. So I ended up needing to book a connecting flight in the one city with availability that would not put me over 22k miles: Dubrovnik. From there I'll be flying SK to Copenhagen. My ticket is I (J), but all of SK's narrowbody fleet just has Y seats so I have no idea what (if any) differentiation in service I'll get there. Finally, there is also (of course) zero ""I"" space on mainline domestic UA flights, so I'll be flying that leg economy.

My wife's flight back was easier: she wanted no fuss, so we put her on the IST-IAH nonstop in TK J.

Booking the flights was a little nerve-wracking because of the limited availability IAH-NRT. When I started looking there were two J seats the day before our ideal departure date and two available on our date. The day I finally pulled the trigger the two seats the day before disappeared, and it turns out that there was a party of three waitlisted for the ANA flight we ended up booking. I ended up calling into the ANA award desk three times. The Japanese agents were some of the most professional and efficient that I've dealt with. The process was really pleasant: I just fed them the date, route, and flight numbers I'd found and they searched for availability and calculated the mileage. They had no issues booking two concurrent itineraries with different legs, although they ended up needing to be on two PNRs. The final call took 45 minutes from start to finish, with about 35 minutes of that being taken up with the agent looking for availability then reserving the space, and then the ticketing office calculating the taxes and fees.

The total cost for the booking was 125,000 ANA miles and $223.78 for me and 125,000 ANA miles and $319.23 for my wife. 2x $25 phone booking fees were also added onto each of our tickets, Points were transferred to my ANA account from my wife's MR account. The transfer time was less than 48 hours, which I was pleasantly surprised by. I also ran into a little snafu that ended up saving me some MR: given that ANA transfer times aren't super predictable, that our mileage was very close to 22,000, and that we would potentially need to book a longer route if seats dried up, I'd originally planned to transfer 290k MR over (since that would cover us up to the next award tier). Since my wife didn't have enough MR in her account, I initiated a transfer of 260k from hers and 30k from mine. Of course I found out a couple days later that ANA only will accept a single transfer per day to a single account; the second transfer will automatically be rejected. This ended up working out for us, since I ended up with 10k stranded at ANA instead of 40k. In the end, however, I don't think I would have had a problem using 40k ANA miles within three years.

After booking the flights I locked down a few of the hotels. A quick call to Marriott got us the Prince Sakura Tower for seven nights, just needed to use 90,000 Marriott points to upgrade the Category 1-5 certificate that I wasn't even sure I was going to be able to use. Next we called Marriott to book the Ritz for two nights with the certificate. The agent was a little confused since she had only booked with Marriott free night certs before, but it still ended up being a painless and quick process. I used a single IHG free night cert to book the Singapore InterContinental- in the next couple months we should be getting two more in that I'll book with once they post. Hoping availability isn't a problem. We still haven't figured out Bangkok, but there are just so many great cash options that I have a feeling we won't be doing an award booking there. Turkey is covered by family (plus the Hilton Garden Inn the night before my flight to DBV: 5,000 HHonors points instead of $50 is something I can get behind). And I'll be doing an AirBNB in Copenhagen.

That just left four more nights on Koh Samui. I was originally thinking about doing a cash booking, but I was underwhelmed with a lot of what I was finding. This is a once-in-a-lifetime trip for us and I wanted to pull out all of the stops, so I decided to go for the Conrad on the southwest corner of the island. Signed my wife up for the Hilton Aspire (the day before they started publishing referral links, of course) and I signed up for the Ascend Business. Those two cards plus my wife's exisiting small HHonors stash would give us enough points to book three nights with a fourth night covered by the weekend night cert. Met the spend on the Aspire within 24 hours of getting it (thanks instant card number!), so those points should be coming fast. But the weekend cert will probably take a while to show up in her account. I""m a little nervous that the low level room space will disappear before we can get that cert, so I made a reservation for a third night at the Ritz just in case we can only do the three points nights at the Conrad.

So that's basically where the trip is at the moment. An itinerary like this is something I've been itching to put together for a while, so getting most of it worked out feels pretty good!

-----------------

**2/22/2018 Edit**: Getting rid of a day in Bangkok in order to do an all-points booking at the Conrad, letting us get a fifth night free. Got another Ascend card to facilitate that. Also added a ryokan in Hakone for an overnight in the middle of our Tokyo stay (thanks /u/captainhector1 for that suggestion!).

-----------------

**3/15/2018 Edit**: Booked our Bangkok hotel and extended our rental car by a day for Koh Samui.

-----------------

**5/9/2018 Edit**: Booked an AirBNB for my overnight in Copenhagen, and switched my Bangkok hotel to take advantage of the CITI50 $50 off two nights at any hotel. Basically trading 8,200 TYP for 6,000 Starpoints.

-----------------

**6/14/2018 Edit**: Changed our Hakone hotel booking to a nicer place with dinner included. Hoping my ExpertFlyer alerts pop up sometime soon that there's ""I"" space for the IAD-IAH leg (doubtful, but one can dream).

-----------------

**6/26/2018 Edit**: A bunch of changes! Decided to roll the dice with the merger that the Ritz certificates would be category-unbounded and canceled the Ritz. The hotel was also not exactly what we wanted for our first two nights: we ended up booking a cheaper (and much more downscale touristy) hotel so that we would be right on a really busy beach. Plus just breakfast for two for two days at the Ritz would have cost more than 2/3 as much as the hotel we ended up booking.

We also decided to pay for a Hilton Premium Club Asia membership, which gives us a few free meal certificates we can use at Zest at the CKS as well as a 50% off discount that applies to all food there including Jahn. The math is a little iffy and we will probably break even, but I mainly got it to reduce the stress that my cheap-ass endures when ordering obviously overpriced food at a resort. 

A side effect of the HPC membership are some accommodation certificates. I was able to use two to book the Conrad Bangkok- one complementary night and one night at a promo rate. I've already emailed the hotel and they will be upgrading us and hopefully doing something nice for our anniversary. There is some renovation going on at the hotel that closed most of the restaurants there but I don't really care since we aren't planning on eating at the hotel.

So net change in cost is +$379 and +21,000 UR, but I'm getting a (significantly) nicer hotel in Bangkok, a more appropriate hotel in Koh Samui with a nicer beach, significant food savings (on overpriced resort food), and two Ritz certs that I'll hopefully be able to use for a trip next year.

Overall, pretty happy and I'm going to stop messing with my itinerary now (unless UA J space opens!).

-----------------

**7/9/2018 Edit**: I couldn't leave well enough alone and decided to swap a 4 am wakeup in Istanbul at a HGI for a night in Dubrovnik at an AirBNB. Cost was $6 in tax differences to change my flight to the day before, plus $74 for the AirBNB."
9,Traveling to Japan? Read this,74,8jo1uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/8jo1uc/traveling_to_japan_read_this/,58,2018-05-15 22:46:17,"We've seen a LOT of travel to Japan posts recently. I would like to revive this post from /u/hidingfrommywife1 on booking ANA F through VS: https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6e82ub/detailed_walkthrough_on_how_to_fly_to_tokyo_in/

tldr: search availability on United.com, identify ""saver"" award flights operated by ANA, call VS at 800.365.9500, feed them flight times + flight class, put flight on hold for 24h (free), transfer points (instant), call back and confirm ticket.

*When searching on United.com, I recommend searching for ""nonstop only"", award flights (obviously), and picking business or first for class of service. Then, once you're on the actual results page, you can use the 30-day calendar in the middle of the screen. With those filters in place, anything on the calendar with 110k will be saver availability (for F, that is)

F: 110k ~~SEA~~, ~~SJC~~, SFO, LAX - 120k JFK, ORD, IAH, IAD

J: 90k - 95k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Y: 60k - 65k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Booking through ANA:

[Low/Regular/High Seasons (also where I obtained these mileage values)](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/int/usage.html)

Y: 40,000	50,000	55,000	

J: 75,000	85,000	90,000

F: 150,000	150,000	165,000



Other common questions:

* You can transfer to VS from all major currencies
* You can only transfer MR to ANA
* NRT and HND are co-terminals. You can fly into one and out the other
* You can redeem as an open jaw. Any US Airport  serviced by ANA -> either TYO airport. Either TYO airport -> any US airport serviced by ANA
* Is F worth it? Yeah its pretty cool. But J would probably adequately satisfy you. The reason F is more popular is because J availability is somewhat scarce. 110/120k on VS versus ~85k biz (either booking method) isn't that much worse though. ANA F for 150k is probably not worth it.
* F is cool but not that great for flying with a companion (hard to talk to them)
* Other choices: you can also get to TYO on United (lots of miles) [or using AA miles on JAL](https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/redeem/award-travel/oneworld-and-other-airline-partner-award-chart.jsp)  (find availability on ba.com, call aa to book), and through Delta."
10,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Chase URs,62,49tbx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbx6/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_chase_urs/,52,2016-03-10 16:03:42,"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/), I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:


***Chase URs***

Chase offers only one personal card that allows for the transfer of Ultimate Rewards points to airline partners – the Sapphire Preferred card. Chase is pretty strict with their approvals for this card, so if you have picked up more than 5 credit cards in the past 24 months, chances are good you will be denied if you apply for this card, so plan accordingly/carefully.

Your URs will transfer to 6 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your URs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Korean Air**

Korean Air is a SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can redeem your SkyPass miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Korean Air is largely considered to be one of the best bang for your buck redemptions to Europe in general and is the best option among UR transfer partners.

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 50k miles for coach, 80k miles for business class and 100k miles for first class – which is the best option for premium cabin redemptions to Europe. Korean Air does allow for one-way award tickets, but as u/wiivile pointed out, the cost is the same for a one-way award as it is for a roundtrip. You are also allowed one stopover on a one-way award ticket and two stopovers on a roundtrip award ticket, which is truly incredible considering you are already getting one of the best redemption rates to Europe to begin with.

While Korean Air Skypass miles offer one of the best values, it can be difficult to work with Korean Air. If you are planning to use your miles to book an award ticket for another person, that other person has to be a family member (mother, father, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, wife, husband or child). You will also need to call in to Korean Air to book your award and the process is somewhat arduous. I would recommend that you call in to make sure space is available and then place a hold on your award ticket(s) before transferring your URs to your Skypass account.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your URs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**United**

United is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. As with Singapore Airlines, that means you are going to have a ton of options!

United uses a two-tier award system for their awards. Economy tickets are the same cost regardless of whether you are on a United flight or a partner flight. A roundtrip saver coach award ticket will cost you 60k miles.

Business and first class award tickets on the other hand will differ in price depending on whether you are flying on a United operated flight or a partner operated flight. For United operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 115k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 160k miles. Alternatively, for partner operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 140k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 220k miles.

As you can see, the much better value when redeeming for premium cabins is with United operated flights – though the actual product is going to be far less enticing than what some of United’s partners such as Swiss Air offer. Since Singapore Airlines would have access to much of the same award inventory as United, you are better off transferring your URs to them instead and then booking the exact same flights for 5-60k miles less.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the worst UR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Southwest**

Unfortunately Southwest does not currently fly to Europe, nor do they have any partners that fly to Europe. If you have a Chase co-branded Southwest credit card, there is a way around this to use your RapidRewards points for international travel, but the value is usually exceedingly poor and I will not get into how to do so here as it will rarely work out in your favor.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your URs!"
11,List: When Airlines Open Award Availability,168,c4w38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c4w38p/list_when_airlines_open_award_availability/,51,2019-06-25 01:26:29,"Here is a list of some airlines and a VERY incomplete list of when they open up award availability. Some of the dates, I have verified. Others I have not and I know some are wrong. I live 16-19 time zones away from most of you, so many dates are +- a day. Due to my time zone “issues,” my strategy is to look a week or two before I think my days are bookable and use that to calibrate the exact day I can book.

Sometimes time zones make a difference if you want to snag an award that is released on a schedule. As a general rule, if the booking airline is the limiting one, it will be released according to their time zone. If the operating carrier is the limiting one, there is a higher chance it will be released based off of the operating carriers time zone.  As a general rule, an airline cannot book partner award space before they open up bookings for their own space.  Qantas is one exception to this rule.

Please help complete this list. It is old and out of date. Feel free to correct dates, add airlines, or add dates.

**Edit: How to use this list.** If you are booking a partner award look at the line for the airline you are looking to fly **and** the airline that operates the mileage program you are booking through. The lower of the two numbers is when you can book the seat. Example: Booking JAL via AA. JAL seats become available at 360 days and AA allows booking 331 days out.  You can book these seat 331 days out. Remember that the time zone of the more restricted airline/program is what matters.

If you are trying to book a seat with a program that does not allow you to book at schedule opening, like the JAL example.  You can check JAL's website at 331+ to get an idea of what seats will be available when AA gets access to JAL's space.

The exact time of day does matter for some bookings.  Please leave any time DP you have in the comments.

Doing as much research as I can and finding out there is a lot to learn. I have been wanting to do this for so long, but now it may become a reality. Plan is for this summer to go to Europe for the first time in our lives (wife and I). Planning for 3 weeks sometime in June or July. I have a cousin in Germany (can't remember if it's Hamburg or Frankfurt) and we also plan to get to Milan, Paris, and possibly Amsterdam if time permits. Germany will be our last stop and where we fly out of to go home. Home airport is IAH, but we can get to anywhere in the US to make whatever flight necessary. If we need to go to JFK or MIA we will probably spend a day or 2 there before the flight. ~~First class~~ into Europe and economy/biz back home.

*Edit: J into Europe and J or economy to get home


1. Can you help me choose an order to hit the cities in Europe? Want to use train once

2. What first class flight/airline would you choose? This will be our first time and probably only time so I want to make the most of it

3. Is 3 weeks enough time to hit 3/4 countries?

4. I already have a place to stay in Germany due to my cousin, but should I make a Marriott nights/flights redemption and use those points towards my flight and also stay a week in Paris or Milan? I want to maximize our time there to see as much as possible, but also have down time

5. Would you try to slip Amsterdam into this trip? Open to other options too


110k Marriott

90k spg

460k MR

346k UR

55k TYP

90k United

Pending: 100k Hilton, 110k Marriott, 75k AA, 10k spg

Prefer to limit the use of MR and UR, but will use as necessary"

So those who wants to experience United Polaris on a long-haul international flight, this is a pretty good chance. This flight isn't even on the United website yet, and is only bookable through phone. When I called, the agent found tons of saver availability (I asked him to look at 4 different days and he found 2+ seats on all of them)

EDIT: Looks like it's out on United website now. Tons of availability open."
14,Honeymoon in Bali advice :),18,bcbymi,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bcbymi/honeymoon_in_bali_advice/,50,2019-04-12 14:28:49,"Hi y'all,

Accumulating all these points has certainly been fun, but now it's becoming crunch time for us to book our honeymoon for this upcoming fall! We're looking at spending around 3 weeks in Bali/Indonesia.  Hoping to fly biz.

From what I've researched, I think our best bet is going to be booking with UA.  I've found a decent amount of ""mixed cabin"" award flights for 90k pp one way, which we don't mind flying economy for the short domestic flights.  The biz flights are with EVA.  It'd be awesome to take advantage of a stopover, but I couldn't seem to find any availability to make that happen.

I'm looking at CLE > ORD > ICN > TPE > DPS.

I've also looked at Singapore Airlines' availability, to transfer to KrisFlyer points, but it looks like its mostly waitlist for biz class.  Plus we'd have to book flights to get to one of their origin airports like SFO or LAX.

Here's our stash situation:

360k UR

60k United

15k AAdvantage (lol)

and we also have the SW CP with only about 5k SW points left in that bank.  Not sure if it'll help much in this situation, unless we can book a cheap flight to get to a better starting point to fly international.

We're going to be flying out of the CLE area, so CLE or PIT would work.  Our dates are flexible - we're getting married Sep 21, so anytime within the next week-ish after that would be ideal.

Any insight would be much appreciated!  Is it too ""easy"" just book through UA?  Seems too simple, but I can't find a better redemption given we're pretty married to UR, and we're only about 5 months out :)"
15,ANA RTW Booked,57,bjoiej,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bjoiej/ana_rtw_booked/,58,2019-05-02 04:15:06,"**Flights:**

Booked a RTW trip through ANA for December for P2 and myself! We wanted to fly business class, so we spent 2 weeks deciding where to go, when to go, and sometimes changing destinations to fit availability and satisfy ANA mileage restrictions. We searched availability strictly through United and it satisfied most of our needs. In the end we landed on:

|From|To|Days Spent (At destination)|Airline|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Chicago (ORD)|Tokyo (NRT)|5|ANA|
|Osaka(KIX)|Beijing (PEK)|Connection|Air China|
|Beijing (PEK)|Phuket (HKT)|5|Air China|
|Phuket (HKT)|Istanbul (IST)|Connection|Turkish|
|Istanbul (IST)|Tel Aviv (TLV)|4|Turkish|
|Tel Aviv (TLV)|Vienna (VIE)|2|Austrian|
|Vienna (VIE)|Budapest (BUD)|3|Austrian|
|Budapest (BUD)|Frankfurt (FRA)|Connection|Lufthansa|
|Frankfurt (FRA)|Amsterdam (AMS)|3|Lufthansa|
|Amsterdam (AMS)|Toronto (YYZ)|1 day (Connection)|Air Canada|
|Toronto (YYZ)|Chicago (ORD)||Air Canada|

&#x200B;

This adds up to about 25 days of travel, \~21,750 miles (right under the 22,000 cut off), and 6-7 destinations. We were hoping to fly the new Polaris, but couldn’t find availability on our dates booking <8 months out. Also sad we couldn't find SQ availability. We still have to plan a lot of the trip, but some things we know for sure are:

* We’re going to take the train (or maybe a flight) straight to Kyoto/Osaka as we liked it more than Tokyo last winter.
* Budapest has a brand new Hyatt opening up that’s about 300 Euro/night, but 8k only points/night, so excited to stay there!

**Booking:**

We each transferred 125k MR to our ANA accounts, the transfer took less than 40 hours for both of us. Then I called ANA and told the agent the flights we found, and asked her to search for 2. In one instance she found a better flight than I did, that I can’t/couldn’t see on United (Osaka to Phuket). She also confirmed we can flights VIE>BUD even though that’s technically backtracking. I was able to book everything for both us from 2 separate ANA accounts since I had both numbers.

**Cost:**

125k MR transferred to ANA by each of to our individual ANA accounts, and $1176 for fuel surcharges. A bit on the higher end, but I’ll live with it. Although I must admit, I'm a bit jealous of [JonLuca's redemption from a few days ago for half the fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bgy1jm/booked_rtw_on_short_notice/)!

&#x200B;

TLDR: 25 days of travel on ANA RTW business across 7 destinations for 125k miles and $1176 per person."

&#x200B;

So I have been planning a trip to HKG for a minute but since there have been months of protests with no end in sight I am thinking I should re-plan my trip.

So pretty much here was my plan - anyone out there have good ideas for somewhere else to go?

\- I have enough United Miles to go Polaris - that was a big part of the trip, so wherever I end up going I would like the bulk of the flight hours to be on Polaris.

\- The food in Hong Kong seems amazing and I was looking forward to gaining several pounds of Michelin Starred Deliciousness.

\- Scenery is epic there.

\- Was planning on total trip time being 10-14 days sometime in Jan/Feb.

\- Was planning on a jaunt over to Thailand or Vietnam.

\- Was also looking to have a few bespoke suits made (silly I know, but it is my trip after all).

&#x200B;

Any thoughts or input is greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Okay folks, so things have happened!

1) I am booked on Eva's J class from seatac to Taipei (thank you so much to u/hidingfrommywife1, u/ASUbuckDevil and u/s1m0nr  for their great advice on airline classes and other spots to goto!)

2) Am booked for 15 days, at this point I will spend a few days on either side in Taipei, then go to Hong Kong for 3 days, a day in Macau (thanks u/twotwo4 !) and then head to Vietnam/Thailand for a few days each (looking into Hoi An - thanks to u/grovemau5)

3) Will return on a 777-300ER Polaris United jet, so I will get to compare.

&#x200B;

Trip Total: 150,000 Miles and $44.15 for a flight package that costs $6,569.70 retail.

Based on TPG Valuations: United Miles go for 1.3 cpp and the above is worth 4.4 cpp

1. They were not available until that same month, so actually I didn't get the exact day in Seoul I wanted (I got Thursday, even though the previous month they had Friday in Seoul). I also had to pay $89 per ticket for booking so close to the date. But the business class savers are only available when the business class seats don't sell out, so it's always close to the date...
2. I used Chase UR points and transferred to to United. I had to call in because it was the first time I was doing this, but otherwise not too bad.

Now for the amenities:

They gave us access to the business class lounge, which had fancy drinks. Some food too, but nothing special. It's usual lounge food. You get better food in Asian lounges (but usually worse drinks).

The flight itself had decent food, and I kept asking for more champagne. But being 6'4"", I was disappointed with the leg room. I couldn't actually bend my legs either, since you stuff them into a hole, so bending them wouldn't fit either. I had to bend and sleep on the side. For business class, this was a let down. Of course, if you're short you have no such issue, it's plenty leg room for people under 6 feet.

They had good screens for entertainment and headphones, but I wish they had better selection. Going to Korea I expected local entertainment. My girlfriend liked that they had a mirror.

Pics here: 
https://imgur.com/a/27VeHO6

I had a long layover in Seoul, which meant we could spend a whole night there. I wish airlines would actually give longer layovers, but that's another subject entirely...

Of course ""business"" class from Seoul wasn't anything special, since it was on a smaller local plane.

Tl;dr it was good, but I'll have to try something else due to the height issue. Maybe it's worth it for you if you fit."

**What is NEXUS?**

NEXUS is a bi-national, Canada-United States program for pre-approved, low-risk travellers entering Canada or the United States (U.S.) at designated air, land and marine ports of entry. The program enables its members to enter either country more quickly and easily by using automated self-serve kiosks in the air mode of travel, dedicated lanes in the land mode of travel, and by calling Telephone Reporting Centres (TRCs) prior to arrival in the marine mode of travel.

**What are the benefits of using NEXUS?**

NEXUS members avoid long line-ups and save time using automated self-serve Nexus kiosks at nine Canadian international airports to enter Canada and Global Entry kiosks when entering the U.S. (NEXUS Air). As an added benefit, when travelling on domestic, U.S.-bound, and select international flights, NEXUS members can be expedited through Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) airport security screening lanes located at 16 Canadian airports. Members must present their valid NEXUS card to access the Trusted Traveller CATSA Security Line. NEXUS members who are U.S. citizens, U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents, or Canadian citizens will also receive the benefits of TSA Pre-Check. They can do so by entering their membership number (PASSID) in the “Known Traveler Number” field when booking reservations, or into their frequent flyer profile with the airline. Members also enjoy a quick and simplified entry process using dedicated lanes at 21 designated land border crossings (NEXUS Land). When arriving by boat, members receive expedited processing at designated marine locations by calling a marine telephone reporting centre. (NEXUS Marine)

NEXUS allows Canadian and U.S. border officers to focus their efforts on unknown and potentially higher-risk travellers and their goods. **Apply for a NEXUS card today at** [Trusted Traveler Programs ](https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/)or visit the Trusted Traveler Programs section of the CBP website at [www.CBP.gov ](http://www.cbp.gov/)or the NEXUS section of the CBSA website at [www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/)."

I'm currently in Chicago, so United Airlines is the go-to. I travel within US on United often for work and also fly to Asia  ~1-2x every year on my own personal expense via All Nippon Airways (ANA). Every time I fly on United, I accumulate it with ANA and am currently at Silver status with Star Alliance.

I'm wondering if it will be better if I just switch to MileagePlus, and just accumulate my miles here, then use them towards ANA flights. Would that be a better strategy? Does that mean I have to start at the bottom again with my Star Alliance status, or can I continue with my current status? Any advice on this is greatly appreciated!

MileagePlus also just [updated their mileage policy](https://mileageplusupdates.com/mileageplus/english/qualification/) so I'm wondering if this new program will make MileagePlus worth more.

You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day

Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your URs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your TYPs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days

Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for “yyy Award Chart” (with ‘yyy’ being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you’re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control – regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA’s award chart – not LAN’s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the process that I use for determining the best redemption value for my points and miles, so hopefully it helps shed some light on how to find the best redemption value for your trip."
23,Award Flights to New Zealand Booking Experience,141,bpb0ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bpb0ra/award_flights_to_new_zealand_booking_experience/,42,2019-05-16 14:48:45,"I currently live in New Zealand and have booked 15-20 USA-New Zealand J awards in the past 18 months using many programs. With the addition of AA and United flying nonstop, it has become less of a unicorn than it was. It does involve a little more planning. Here is a lot of the information that I have learned about the specific route and my general booking process.  I have included many booking options but ran out of steam to include them all. It may also ramble since it was mainly written to pass time without internet coverage in the car.

  
**Nonstop**  
**Air New Zealand (NZ)**  
This space is hard to come by in J. A little easier in Y. The best way to look for space is an Expert Flyer alert since availability tends to be random if it opens up at all. More likely, one seat to open up, but I have seen multiple. More offseason space released. YVR, SFO, LAX, IAH, ORD, HNL.   
**United (UA)**  
Nonstop year round SFO-AKL, during \~April-October it does not fly every day. They do open up J space randomly on this route. I have seen 8+ J seats available, but this is an exception, not the rule. Do not expect saver availability around Christmas. I have seen J space released to partners. SFO.   
**American (AA)**  
Nonstop LAX-AKL daily seasonal, roughly November-March. They do release space on this route, but the release is not predictable. Some are close in, and some are further out. I have seen a lot of married segment logic on this route. PHX is a good city to use if you are looking for a default city that shows most married segment logic. LAX.   
**Air Canada**  
Nonstop YVR-AKL, 4X week, mid-December- end March. This route is brand new (hasn’t been flown yet), but they have released some J space. I anticipate there will be some changes for the 2020/21 “season” after they see how the route does. YVR. 

  
**Connections**  
Three main regions are used for connections to New Zealand: Australia, South Pacific, and Asia. Not all programs allow you to connect through all the regions. Almost all allow you to connect through Australia. If you are connecting through Australia on NZ a320/a321s they are a one cabin aircraft and do not have J (772, 773, and 787 do have J).

  
**Booking Through Award Programs**  
**AA**  
Their routing rules allow you to connect through the South Pacific and Australia to New Zealand, but not through Asia. AA is a pain to search since they often show a domestic F flight and a TPAC economy flight as a J award.  
Direct: Flying the seasonal AA LAX-SFO route  
Australia: Flying AA or Qantas to Australia and then Qantas to AKL, WLG, CHC, or ZQN. Qantas opens up flights \~360 days, which can reduce availability for AA at 330 days.   
Air Tahiti New: Decent availability has been showing in J without overnight connections when the schedule opens. Shows on AA’s website and flies to AKL.  
Fiji: Not the best product and availability is hit or miss. Remember to search for flights to AKL, WLG, and CHC since sometimes availability isn’t available on the final leg to each destination.  
Qatar: This counts as two awards and is in the process of getting Qsuites. Availability has been pretty decent for AKL-DOH in late 2018/early 2019.    
**ANA(NH)**  
This is the program that it is the easiest to find availability to New Zealand since they allow you to create your a routing with three connections. You have to fly TPAC, must book roundtrip, and are allowed one stopover. ANA’s search engine is pretty limited when searching, but you can use a multi-destination search to “force” your routing. ANA’s search engine typically does not include flights that connect from the US to ICN, TPE, PEK, or PVG on their searches. Remember to search for AKL, WLG, CHC, and ZQN. It can be time intensive to find an award, but I have never not been able to piece together a J award. Singapore opens up a decent amount of space on their AKL-SIN and WLG-SIN (regional product).   
**Alaska (AS)**  
Alaska has a different award chart for each of their partners. You can mix Alaska flights with a partner, but you cannot use multiple partners on one ticket. You are allowed a stopover on a one-way award. This gives you more flexibility since your TPAC and flight to NZ can have availability on separate days.   
Cathay Pacific: Must be booked via phone, use BA or QF to find availability, but keep in mind CX often releases one less seat to AS than One World partners. AKL, CHC  
Fiji: Can be searched on AS. Availability is sometimes different than Expert Flyer. AKL, WLG, CHC  
Qantas: Can be searched on AS. AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN  
Korean: Must book roundtrip. Searchable on AS. AKL  
**Avianca/Lifemiles**  
I have seen a lot of restrictions on what routes you can book with Lifemiles to New Zealand. They tend to be more restrictive than UA and ANA, but I still have found availability with them. You generally cannot create your routing. They do allow Asia connections.   
**Cathay**  
You can get additional award availability if you book directly. AKL and CHC.   
**Delta**  
Delta does not fly to New Zealand, and the rates are typically extremely high. They are partners with Virgin Australia, and you can connect through Australia. China Eastern (PVG), China Southern (CAN), Korean (ICN), and China Airlines (TPE-BNE-AKL) are Sky Team members that fly to AKL.   
**JAL**  
The cheapest way to book Emirates from AKL. Leaving AKL the YQ (fuel surcharge) is pretty low. The other One World information applies, watch for YQ. The rates tend to be reasonable, but the miles are tough to get. You can book 360 days out and will have access to One World inventory 360 days out.  
**Qantas**  
The advantage of booking directly with Qantas is that you can book \~360 days out and they sometimes release availability at the start of the schedule for their US routes. There is YQ, and the mileage amounts are typically higher than booking via AA.  
**Singapore**  
Partner award rates are very high, and UA in most cases would be a better option. If you want to fly SQ TPAC in a premium cabin, you almost always need to book directly through SQ since they basically never release those seats to partners. Starting in 2018 it does seem that there are releasing a lot more J space to partners from SIN-AKL/WLG/Australia  
**United**  
UA lets you route through Asia to get to New Zealand. The routes that they allow are highly variable and hard to figure out. I recommend searching for many US cities and AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN. UA’s issues booking various Asian carriers award space has reduced space connecting in Asia. You cannot piece together your own award. You can currently waitlist flights on UA metal and prepay for them (not sure if this is/will be possible after November 15). I have had success on the AKL-SFO route with this clearing 48 hours before departure.   
**Virgin Atlantic (VS)**  
Most of the talk with VS is about booking ANA to Japan. They have a great rate on NZ metal of 62.5k in J between the US and New Zealand (transfer bonuses put this between 48-55k). The issue is that this is the unicorn flight (unless you are flying May-August). There is award space released randomly, and Expert Flyer is your best bet. I have managed to book this award before.  A good option for May-August when NZ released more space.

  
**Strategy**   
I first decide what is my optimal booking. Do I want to fly CX, nonstop, stopover in Asia/Fiji? Then I look at how many seats I am trying to book. I then figure out when award seats open up for my desired booking. If I am not at that date, I monitor what award seats become available and if I think it will open up at schedule opening. If the schedule is already open, I search to see if there is availability. If there isn’t, I search for other routes. If I cannot find any award availability that pops up in searching, there are 3 main options I consider.   
\-Booking with ANA via Asia. You can create your own itinerary, and as long as you can find a TPAC to somewhere in Asia you should be able to stitch together a routing. This does take some time. 

\-Set Expert Flyer alerts for every nonstop NZ, UA, and AA nonstop flight that would work. Space does come available randomly.   
\-If there is UA economy saver space, waitlisting J via UA.   


I am willing to book a one-way flight and wait for a return flight. The only exception is mid-December through mid-January.   
Through the entire process, I keep in mind how many tickets I am trying to book.   
1 ticket- Higher likelihood of NZ award seat becoming available. Higher likely of AA seat becoming available within 90 days.   
2 tickets- Nonstop flights are still a possibility. NZ frequently only releases 1 J seat on many of their Asia routes at schedule opening so I count on them. A very doable number.   
3+ tickets- This gets tricky. I have seen UA release I9, which is at least 9 J award seats. This is not normal. The ANA route can be a little more difficult with 3+. The TPAC will be your most challenging flight, followed by the last flight to New Zealand, but there are frequently 3+ seats between New Zealand and Australia. UA waitlist on separate PNRs is a good backup if you can find saver Y.

edit: A lot of the routing rules and general information of this post apply when flying to Australia since almost all award charts combing Australia and New Zealand in the same region. The capacity to Australia is about 4-5 times greater than New Zealand and I have not included a breakdown of flights to Australia."
24,Offered free Gold Status on AA for 3 months even though I typically fly United. Worth booking upcoming flights on AA instead of United?,16,c2bqfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c2bqfl/offered_free_gold_status_on_aa_for_3_months_even/,45,2019-06-19 07:05:46,"I checked my e-mail today and found American Airlines offered me free gold status until 9/25. The promotion is to maintain gold through Jan 2021 by spending $850 EQD and going 7,000 EQMs by 9/25.

This came as a surprise as I am not a loyal AA flyer. I fly somewhat often for work, ranging from 3-6 days a month. I have 9.9K miles on AA, about 6K flown this year from trips to Vegas, Miami, and Boston.

&#x200B;

My upcoming trips (none of are booked yet):

\-RT DC to Madison for work (highly likely)

\-RT DC to Orlando for work

\-RT DC to San Francisco for work

\-1 way DC to Boston (other way is  on Jetblue, this was a personal trip so I went with who was cheaper)

&#x200B;

Looking at my trips above and roughly calculating cost, it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation. (I'll likely have one other work trip thrown in, but these are confirmed) which would get me to gold on AA through 2021. However, I typically fly United since I grew up near a hub and tried to stay somewhat loyal when convenient and/or affordable. I have 27K miles on United but not any status (and a RT flight to Spain booked on United). I was planning to book all of my above trips on United for this reason, to keep accruing miles.

&#x200B;

So my question is:

1. Should I switch plans and book all of my upcoming trips on AA instead of United to hit the promotion? Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?
2. Would it make sense to abandon loyalty to United and start flying AA going forward? I feel like if I switched to AA with the promotion I'm dividing up my miles and not really highly accruing on either (I'dbe about even on both airlines by Sept.)

&#x200B;

Some Notes:

\-I care more about being able to accrue miles (maybe to book a free trip in the near future) than say upgrades. The extra legroom perk would be nice since I'm tall but I wouldn't give up accruing more miles on one airline for that, especially since I can expense it for work flights on longer trips anyway.

\-I don't have a travel credit card except the Uber Barclays Card (3% cahs back regardless of brand).

\-I live close to DCA (an AA hub). United also flies out of DCA and has a hub in Dulles which isn't so far

\-I don't have strong feelings one way or the other about the brands. I've generally never had a problem on either.

\-For what it's worth, I'm silver on Marriott which has some kind of partnership with United

25,Chase Sapphire Reserve Partner Transfer,10,ainy6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/ainy6o/chase_sapphire_reserve_partner_transfer/,40,2019-01-22 18:33:23,"Hi,

I was trying to book a United awards flight using the 1:1 transfer from UR to MileagePlus. My wife and I have a combined points balance big enough for the flight.

   
I spent over an hour on the phone with United booking a flight that was a combination of an awards ticket and a paid ticket. When everything was all set up, they charged my credit card for the paid reservation, and said to call back quickly when my MileagePlus account had the appropriate amount of miles in it to complete the awards ticket.

&#x200B;

First issue, Chase would not allow me to transfer my wife's UR points (CSP) to my UR account (CSR) online so I had to call in. They said they do not know why it isn't working but there is nothing they can do. So I suggested that my wife and I both transfer our points from our UR respective accounts to my MileagePlus account. The agent at Chase said that this transfer is no longer instant and will likely take up to 7 days to populate in my MileagePlus account. 

&#x200B;

In total, There would have been five passengers flying on these two reservations (three paid, two on UR points), so a rate lock of $30 per passenger for 7 days seemed a bit steep. I canceled both reservations and booked at full fare with another airline.

&#x200B;

My questions:

Is what the Chase agent said true? I have transferred UR to MileagePlus points (years ago) and it was instant.

How do you book flights? Do you transfer points before booking the reservation so the points are readily available? Seems like that severely limits how we can use them when booking.

Is the CSR a garbage card now? No more price protection, Priority Pass in the US gets me laughed out of most lounges, and now allegedly non-instant points transfers?

&#x200B;

I like to travel and find a premium card's annual fee is worth while if the benefits are good. Is there a new card that I should be using? With that said, $150 per year after travel credit might be the best option for me?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your time!"

28,What's the catch for Wyndham rewards?,7,apo4n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/apo4n8/whats_the_catch_for_wyndham_rewards/,39,2019-02-12 05:14:24,"Hi everyone!

I did my Googling and also consulted the side panel but if this is not allowed please let me know! Not sure if this is the best place to ask.

I'm an ""entry-level"" frequent traveler and I am moderately into airline and credit card points. I'm often on United Gold status—just for context on my travels. I never really researched hotel points as I often book with Hotels.com for the de facto 10% off.

I just decided to start looking into hotels and decided that since most of my wife's business trips stay with IHG or Marriott properties, I should probably look into another program to maximize benefits when we travel together to visit family etc. I'm a freelancer—almost all of my travels are paid out-of-pocket. Wyndham has quite some lower-mid-tier brands like Wingate and La Quinta that I often stay with, so it looks like a good, if not less popular program to go with.

I understand that they have a blanket 15,000 points redeeming policy. Their points are also not difficult to accumulate since every stay guarantees at least 1,000. Their statuses, while not that rewarding, have pretty low requirements to reach. This sounds like a really great program especially when I can stay at higher tier properties for just 15,000 a night, with what they advertise as no blackout dates. So my question is—what's the catch? It couldn't be this good and easy, right? Or is it? And is there a better program that I should look into? (I have Hyatt and Marriott statuses through United but I don't stay with them often. I was looking into Hilton but their mid-tier products aren't as plenty as Wyndham.)

Thanks in advance for your insights!"
29,"Booked award ticket, United changed it to a terrible itinerary. Do we have any recourse?",17,55q4d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/55q4d2/booked_award_ticket_united_changed_it_to_a/,37,2016-10-04 01:39:31,"Hey guys,

My husband and I booked two economy award tickets from Queenstown to Anchorage in March.  Yesterday, about two weeks after booking, united sent us an email saying they changed the itinerary but we were still confirmed.

The first itinerary they booked for us arrived in Chicago at 4pm and then departed at 8am the same day (8 hours before arriving).  We called to change it and they said the only option was the following:

Queenstown - Auckland, Auckland - Oakland, Oakland - San Francisco, San Francisco - San Diego, San Diego - Denver, Denver - Anchorage, with a 16 hour layover in San Francisco and an overnight layover in San Diego. This is approximately 56 hours of travel, as opposed to 36 with the original itinerary.  The CSR claimed this was the only option for any date in early March.  United.com shows no award availability remaining for March.

This seems like a load of hooey to me (but par for the course with my experience with united).  We have already transferred our UR points to united to book this ticket, so it seems we're stuck with them.

Does anybody have any suggestions for how to wrangle a more manageable itinerary from my least favorite airline?  Thanks in advance.

30,"Award Tickets 202: How To Book A ""One-Way"" Award Ticket Using ANA Miles",35,4hhoda,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4hhoda/award_tickets_202_how_to_book_a_oneway_award/,35,2016-05-02 18:38:52,"Let me start off by saying that I do not advocate for anyone doing ""throw away ticketing"", but with that said, there have been a few questions here over the past few months asking about one-way award tickets using ANA miles. As a result, I decided to put together a little guide for how to technically book a one-way award ticket using ANA miles. The [original post with pictures can be found here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-202-one-way-award-tickets-on-ana/). If it seems like I missed anything, please feel free to let me know!

I will start with a brief primer on ANA for those that are not familiar with the airline, their transfer partners or their award chart. ANA’s award chart underwent a devaluation of sorts approximately a year ago. While devaluations are bad in general, the changes really were not that bad in the big scheme of things.

ANA also offers what is largely considered one of the best first class products in the sky.

[ANA First Class](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-2.jpg?w=480)

As well as a great (albeit boring color combination) business class product.

[ANA Business Class](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-3.jpg?w=930)

In addition, you can use ANA miles to book award tickets on any of the Star Alliance partner airlines. These include:

[ANA Star Alliance Partners](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-4.png?w=576)

As you can see, there are quite a few options for your award redemptions – and that translates into value!

**EARNING ANA MILES**

ANA partners with both American Express and SPG, so both your Membership Rewards points and your SPG Starpoints can be transferred to ANA. Your Membership Rewards points will transfer to ANA at a 1:1 ratio.

**ANA'S AWARD CHART**

Like most airlines these days, ANA uses two different award charts – one for flights operated by ANA, and one for flights operated by their partners.

The [award chart for flights operated by ANA](http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/amc/reference/tukau/kokusai.html) uses a low, regular and high season system where you award costs will vary according to the date(s) of your flight(s). This will vary depending on the year, your origin and your destination, so it is worth reviewing before you transfer your hard earned Starpoints or Membership Rewards points.

The [award chart for flights operated by ANA’s partners](http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/amc/reference/tukau/teikeiair_1.html) uses a zone based system with no difference in redemption cost due to the date(s) of your travel(s).

**IMPORTANT NOTES ON ANA AWARD TICKET RULES**

It is worth noting that if your itinerary includes both ANA flights and a partner flight, you will be subject to the ANA partner award chart.

[ANA Rule](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-9.png?w=593)

It also important to know that ANA (much like Korean Air) only allows you to redeem miles for your family members – all of whom you will have to register (up to 10) in advance of ticketing your award ticket. This is how ANA defines “family members”:

[ANA Family Members](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-8.png?w=611)

Lastly, ANA requires that you book a round-trip ticket. You will notice there is no option to select on the award search page for a one-way ticket.

[ANA Main Search Page](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-10.png?w=752)

The relevant rule states that the departure airport and the final destination on the itinerary may differ, but must be in the same country.

[ANA Rule](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-11.png?w=667)

This is very important language and the key to being able to book a one-way award ticket using your ANA miles!

**HOW TO BOOK A ONE-WAY AWARD**

Given the language of the rule, that means an itinerary that went Orlando (MCO) to Chicago (ORD) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on the outbound and Tokyo Narita (NRT) to New York (JFK) on the return would be a valid routing because you both departed from, and returned to, the same country – the United States.

[ANA Valid Open-Jaw Routing](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-12.png?w=588)

That routing in economy would cost you 55,000 miles. Not a great redemption, but also not a horrible redemption all things considered.

[ANA Redemption Rate](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-13.png?w=963)

But what about if you actually just need the first segment from Orlando (MCO) to Tokyo Narita (NRT)? There is no option to search for a one-way award ticket, so you need to get a bit creative. Remember how the award ticket rules only said you had to return to the country you departed from? That means you can tack on a flight from somewhere like Monterrey Mexico (MTY) to Houston (IAH) to make your ticket a round-trip!

[ANA ""One-Way"" Routing](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANA-14.png?w=966)

As you can see, this satisfies the award ticket rules, and will only cost you 42,500 miles in economy. The segment from Monterrey (MTY) to Houston (IAH) will be a throw away ticket (i.e., one you have no intention of actually flying), but you could also use it down the road for the return segment of a later trip!

If you are returning to the United States, Air Canada and United usually have pretty good availability from Canada or Mexico to United’s hubs in the United States. Just keep plugging in your city pairs until you find something that has space available.

Again, this option will not necessarily create great value, but can be a good value if you run into a situation where you have one portion of your trip already booked, but cannot find one-way saver level award space on any airline that you have miles with. With a bit of creativity and knowledge/research on Star Alliance flights, you can really get this to work to your advantage if you are in a situation where you need a one-way award ticket that only ANA is showing availability for.

**Final Thoughts**

Not only does ANA offer some very generous redemption rates and routing rules, but they also offer a great product. While I do not generally recommend that travelers skirt the award ticket rules or book flights they have no intention of actually flying, this trick actually does comply with the ANA award ticket rules (not factoring in the throw away ticketing). Hopefully this helps give you some ideas for how to redeem your miles for a one-way ANA award ticket!"

We live in MA. 


With flights being a god damn $1400+ per person, I'm now looking into a good miles card! My credit score is 750, so I pretty much have all options available to me. We do not really travel much, so this needs to be something I can get with regular bills/expenses. 


Do these cards typically only work for certain airlines? I've been checking Skyscanner and most of the cheaper flights are via United. I don't want to get an airline specific card only for the ticket prices to be $2k each and only get a little bit of money off that ends up being the same price or more as a United flight. How does this work?

I read[ this thread over](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/55wyli/guide_to_a_cheap_vacation_for_newbies/) on /r/churning and found it great - should I get those first two cards? 

Or is there a better plan to get a decent discount?

**Backstory** - I'm a US expat and travel hacker living in Sydney with my wife. We've been here for 6 months and seen a lot of the same questions about the area get posted almost daily. I'll do my best to concisely run through a number of topics here, whether it be about getting here or what to do, in the hopes this makes future questions a little more tactical.  
  
##NOTE: PLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE! 
###Update 1 - Added booking windows and intra-region travel info. 

##Getting Here
###Cash
Great deals to be had lately in economy. Prices have consistently dropped $800 or so from mainland USA on full service carriers. These sales are pretty frequent. If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve card a $800 cash ticket is just over 53,000 Ultimate Rewards points with FULL points earn on the ticket itself. That's a great deal if you don't care about sitting up front.  
Business class is significantly more expensive. This is one of the most sought after premium class routes on the planet and with that prices tend to stay high and award availability low. 

####From the East Coast of the US  
I highly recommend AA to DFW and Qantas DFW-SYD. The route is served by a comfortable A380 (good economy, dated 2-2-2 J though) and loads are typically intentionally kept low heading East to maximize cargo capacity. That means you can realistically expect a empty middle seat if you plan well. On the eastbound side it's still possible but less likely. Also, if you fly on low days you may score an upgrade for $1,000 - $1,200 USD per person, per way, via Qantas' bid for upgrade program. Really the major benefit here is connections going further into the US - minimizing travel time on either side of that long leg is incredibly more valuable and comfortable.

####From the West Coast of the US
Any carrier works here, chose based on your preference. Every domestic carrier serves the route (UA/AA/DL) and most are newer aircraft (sans Delta's aging 777s). You can also find good deals via Fiji as well as via Auckland on Air New Zealand. I personally don't like breaking up the trip any more than necessary so I don't like those options.  

###Points  
Oh boy, this is a good one. Generally the rule of thumb is simply this, **PLAN AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO FLY UP FRONT!** The only exception to this is Virgin Australia who sometimes releases J space < 2 weeks of travel. That's absolutely rolling the dice though. Economy wise you can typically find space on at least one carrier so that's less of a topic, and as above, with cash prices being so low it can often be less worthwhile to book the award itself.  
Up front you really have a few options.   
 &nbsp;  

**US Carriers**  
 &nbsp;  
  
Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---
United | 338 | Good J hard product, meh soft product. Awards open up here and there but typically it's very limited to last minute redemption. Price-wise, they're not the cheapest, but not the most expensive.  
AA | 331| probably the best hard produce from the group. Same meh soft product (they're US carriers after all). Pricing is also okay, but availability is next to none.  
Delta | 331| bad products, hard and soft. The seats are old, the service is older. Price is highest BUT you will often find saver-level seats on Virgin Australia (a partner) < 2 weeks out.  
   &nbsp;  
**Australian Carriers**  
 &nbsp;

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Qantas| 353 | meh J product (2-2-2). Good/Great F. Service is also good, very polished. Availability in spurts, but okay price via AA.   
Virgin Australia | 330 | best seat (the Business) and I'm a sucker for a bird with a bar. Conversely, terrible availability unless you're looking within 2 weeks or right at the window. 
 &nbsp;  
**Asian Carriers (generally better availability)**  
 &nbsp;  

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Korean | 360? | my personal favorite. Great airline, great US service, and a transfer partner of Chase. And most importantly, they tend to be quite generous with their availability. 
Cathay | 360 | old favorite in the points world. Not the cheapest option but if you have the points then you'll often find availability through HKG when you book at the window. Great seat, classic service, and AMAZING lounges in HKG. 
JAL | 330 | like ANA, in light of recently US carrier devaluations these guys have become a viable option through Tokyo. Some recommend their 777 SkySuite as the best J product out there. 
SQ | 355 | Suites are always a favorite but lately it's pretty impossible to not pull your hair out before actually confirming that route. J availability tends to show up here and there. Recently devauled though so use tool to find best option based on points available. 
ANA | 356 | mentioned in JAL topic, just a solid all around option if you have the points. 
 &nbsp;  
**Award Tools**  
Look, I know a lot of carriers were mentioned above and you're probably going well, that's all great, but how do I ultimately choose one given the fact that I have a trip 1+ year out and a few options? That's where the below sites come in handy. They will tell decipher award charts and help you distill down the airlines that you can realistically fly given the points that you have.

##Once In The Region
###Intra-Region Travel 
  
* Staying in the South/South East (SYD/BNE/MEL/PER/etc.) - Avios, Avios, Avios! SYD-MEL, for example, is 4,500 Avios one way on Qantas. This is an amazing sweet spot. 
* Cross Country Travel - This is tough. Economy prices aren't terribly high, but the business class product on these flights is top notch. Virgin flies ""The Business"" A330 and Qantas flies an equivalent A330 through the continent and they really cater to those premium travelers. I still haven't come up with the best way of doing this with points though local frequent flyers swear by the points upgrade to get up front. 
* Across the Ditch (To/From NZ) - My recommendation is Air New Zealand. I recently booked this and spent 25k Krisflyer (Singapore) for a RT flight on Air New Zealand. I definitely consider that tremendous value, though discount carriers operate these routes and you can find deals (I would consider $300 round trip in economy to be a good deal).

###Sydney-Specific
Rule of thumb, if you have 5+ days in the region than I suggest going outside of Sydney. It's a cool city, but there is SO much more to see. Scroll down for details, but while in Sydney here are a few suggestions:

* Taronga Zoo – One of my favourites. A great place to see all the local animals that the US doesn’t have. **This is a FANTASTIC first day activity and will help you fight jet lag!**
* Bondi to Cogee Walk – A beautiful self-guided walk down the coast. It’s just a walking path but it's a must do. 
* Harbour Bridge Climb – Climb atop Sydney’s most famous bridge to see the city like nowhere else. Younger people love it, older people tend to avoid it. I haven't done it and don't plan to. 
* Sydney Opera House – The most famous landmark in Sydney. We could see a show or just do a tour. Up to you.
* Manly Ferry/Beach – Manly beach is amazing and the surrounding area is filled with bars and restaurants. This would take up the majority of a day. The ferry there and back is a mini sightseeing tour in and of itself.
* Sydney Bus Tours - Highly recommended as it takes you all over the city and even out to Bondi. Hop on/Hop off style so you can wander if you like a stop.
* Sydney Boat Tours – Just like the bus tours, the boat tours allow you to get off at stops and explore. A great way to maneuver around the water and hit the main points of interest. Could be a good way to see Manly, too. Do NOT do a dinner cruise, the food is bad and it's just a waste of time. 
* The Rocks – Located right in the harbour, the Rocks is an area with numerous restaurants, a famous market and Australia’s oldest pubs.
* Darling Harbour – Like the Rocks, DH is another touristy area on the water that has a ton of restaurants and bars. Also has a Ferris wheel, an enormous fish market with tons of fresh seafood, and a casino.
* Sydney Seaplanes – Name says it all. I absolutely LOVED the ""Sydney Secrets"" tour. 
* Featherdale Wildlife Park – Never been here but it comes highly recommended. Basically it is an animal park where all of the animals are loose and you can interact with them. All of the Australian animals will be there. It is a little bit of a drive but definitely doable.
* Blue Mountains – A national park that has a bunch of beautiful views and is much different from the water you get all around the city. They have a similar bus tour to all the attractions which lets you hop on/off at will. A train will take us directly up there if you’d like to go.
* Hunter Valley – Australia is known for its wine and HV is the closest region to the city.
  
**Places to Stay**
  
* Park Hyatt Syndey - go to place for best of the best stays. On Cirqular Quay with views of Opera House. 
* Westin Sydney - downtown, good location (10 min walk from quay), nice hotel. 
* Hilton Sydney - downtown, same as Westin. 
* Intercontinental Double Bay - ritzy area of town, looks to be a nice hotel. I live nearby so I'm biased - it's a good spot but out of the hustle and bustle. 
* Marriott - also downtown, 5 min from quay. Lobby recently redone, rooms are supposedly very nice, too. 
* Four Points Sydney - closer to Chinatown but still downtown. 20 min qay to quay. I've heard it's nice.
* There are tons more, this is a whole topic in an of itself.

###Regional
**Are you outdoorsy?**  
 
* Queenstown, NZ (~3 hour flight) - The end all be all go-to place for being outdoors. If you like being outside/hiking/etc. this should absolutely be on your list See extreme activities section.
* Tasmania - 
* Blue Mountains - see above. 
* Royal National Park (~30 min from Sydney) - great national park with some beautiful hiking spots. Not huge, but easy to get to and is a good excursion.

**Do you like food/drinks?**   

* Melbourne (pronounced Melbun) - Where to begin? Really the best way of thinking about Sydney vs. Melbourne, which is a HUGE rivalry by the way, is to put it simply as > Sydney has the sights whereas Melbourne has the culture. 

**Extreme activities?**   

* Cairnes (pronounced Cans) - the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. Backpacker town (if you want a nicer area near the GBR see Port Douglas) and full of bars and nightlife. If you're younger, want to hang out with some peers, and go diving, go here. 
* Queenstown - the extreme sports capital of the world or something like that. Has it all - skiing, skydiving, bungee jumping, rafting, etc. 

**Animals**
  
* Featherdale Wildlife Park - Near Sydney, see above section. 
* Taronga Zoo - see Sydney section.
* Austrlaia Zoo - Up near Sunshine Coast, not familiar with it. 
  
**Cultural**  
  
* Melbourne - see food.   
* Uluru - Where Ayers Rock is. Great for the ""Outback"" experience. Can fly (3 hrs) from Sydney, not/nothing else there though. 
  
**Beaches/Relaxation**  
  
* Lord Howe Island - limited access island. Super exclusive. Best value is booking out and using Qantas points to get there. 16k or so round trip for $1,000 flight.   
* Hamilton Island - right off barrier reef's southern end. Beautiful islands with Whitsundays islands nearby.  
* Port Douglas - the nicer way to get to the Great Barrier Reef (as opposed to touristy/backpacker Cairns).  
* Bondi/Bronte/Coogee/etc. - Eastern beaches. All near Syndey. Bondi to Coogee walk will show you most of them.  
* Northern Beaches (30 - 45 min car ride from city). More laid back beaches outside of the city. Slower paces, friendlier locals. 

##Example Itinerary##
Assumes 10 days down under.
  
* Day 1 - Land in SYD, drop bags at hotel, change, and head straight to Zoo. DO NOT NAP. Try to stay awake until 7p or so. Good luck.
* Day 2 Sydney - Hop on/Hop off bus tour. Do Bondi to Coogee walk when you get to Bondi. Figure out what you like and don't like along the way.
* Day 3 Travel to Melbourne - Dinner downtown. 
* Day 4 Melbourne - Coffee, walk around CBD, Great Ocean Road maybe?
* Day 5 Travel to Queenstown, NZ
* Day 6 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 7 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 8 Travel to Sydney 
* Day 9 Sydney - Opera House tour. Ferry to Manly for lunch/afternoon. 
* Day 10 Depart Sydney

Or I can fly out of JFK and take all Singapore Airlines flights (one way flight). For 135,000 miles + $36.50 I can fly business class all the way. Total travel time would be 26-27 hours depending on which flights I take. 

I just wasn't that impressed with Air China's business class seats from the pictures and videos I've seen online. This will be my first really long flight and I just really want the best experience.

36,From San Diego to Vancouver Trip,1,ber8lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/ber8lg/from_san_diego_to_vancouver_trip/,32,2019-04-19 01:52:08,"Hello all,

37,Experience booking Emirates Business through JAL,26,6ybu1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6ybu1k/experience_booking_emirates_business_through_jal/,32,2017-09-06 03:29:15,"I made my first major award redemption today (yay me!) by booking two business class seats on Emirates through Japan Airlines (JAL) from the US to India and back. 

Prior to my reservations, I had about 159.5k SPG Points, 300k+ UR, 85k TYP, and around 140k AA miles. I was open to the idea of buying more points/miles to compensate any deficit and travel a little more comfortably as two economy tickets were going to cost me roughly $2000 anyway.

After having scoured the inter webs, I found a good number of options for booking these flights. Here's the breakdown of a few that I found:

- SPG points to Alaska to book on Cathay Pacific at 125k miles RT per person [decent, but I didn't quite like Cathay's business class product. Also, the HKK to India route was on Cathay Dragon.]

- American to fly either Qatar or Etihad at 140k miles RT per person [I could have moved my SPG points or bought AA miles. Didn't care too much to spend 280k miles on the flights, though. Approx. 3c/mile value]

- United to book Lufthansa at 160k miles RT per person [I wouldn't have minded flying Lufthansa, but that would mean I'd have to spend almost 320 UR OR buy and move a bunch of SPG points and that seemed a waste. Approx. 2.6c/mile value]

- SPG points to JAL to book on Cathay Pacific/Emirates/Qatar at 100k miles RT per person [This worked out the best as I had to transfer only 160k SPG points and was the cheapest in terms of redemption]

My first preference going into this was Qatar Airways because of the lie flat seats offered in the 777-ER, as well as the more modern design of the interiors in the aircraft. Unfortunately, I could not find availability on the dates that I needed - we weren't terribly constrained but could not find anything within a couple of weeks even. That left Emirates. 

I transferred 60k SPG points per day to JAL to ensure I received the additional 5k for every 20k. It took exactly 5 days for each transfer to appear in my JAL account.

With my 200k JAL miles, I called their phone reservation number (1-800-JAL-FONE (1-800-525-3663*)) only to be kept on hold for 40 minutes. I also lost network before I could make my reservations, which meant calling back and enduring another 30 minute wait. 

The agent who took my call was extremely friendly and was appreciative of the fact that I had all my flight information ready at hand. My flights were booked in all of 8 minutes, 2 of which went in making sure she spelt my wife's name correctly (the missus has a longish name). The agent wasn't able to ticket our reservations immediately because my wife and I do not share the same last name and for some reason, she needed proof of marriage. Easy enough to provide by scanning and emailing them our marriage certificate. Within a few minutes of doing so, our tickets were confirmed and I was able to select seats on the Emirates website. 

All in all, a pretty awesome experience. I wish I didn't have to wait that long on the phone to make my reservations, but I'll live with it for now. Taking into consideration the taxes and fees for the flights [$137 for both of us] and the $17.5 I spent on the 500 extra SPG points, I'm getting a value of a little over 5c/point on SPG [based on today's fares for the same flight] which I think is pretty decent. 

Now, I need to start replenishing my SPG account.

Update: I realized that I did not mention that I used Qantas and Alaska Air to look for award availability. I also signed up at Expert Flyer for more information.

For anyone attempting this, I'd suggest looking for flights one sector at a time. A lot of the flights I saw on Alaska and Qantas had mixed cabin availability which doesn't lead to a full business class experience."

 * Cathay Pacific for 220k miles  
  
First of all, is there any airline I've overlooked?  Second, which of the recommended airlines offers the best premium cabin product?  I've seen that united doesn't have aisle access for all premium cabin seats, which makes me less interested in flying united for such a long flight."

I live in Southern California, and John Wayne Airport is the closest option for me.  I do fly LAX but only when I need to.  Since JWA isn't a major hub, I tend to fly different airlines.  I have 40-80k points on United, American, and Delta (each) and I don't think at this rate I'll ever get upgraded to first class or get free flights if I'm not doing things correctly.  I also have 60k points with Marriott.

I know I'm not traveling a ton, but I do go on 2-3 trips per month, so I figure that's enough that could add up.  

Can I convert points from one airline or hotel to another?

I'm thinking of consolidating and trying my best to only fly American.  Is this a good idea?

How do I make sure to maximize my benefits in the future?  Can I earn airline miles from my hotel stays and rental cars?  

My ultimate goal would be to get free airline tickets for my family.  If I can get upgraded seats during business travel, I wouldn't object - but the priority is getting free tickets for my wife and kids."

| Location/Flights |Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
Etihad First Class Apartments - JFK-AUH-MLE | 115k AA miles | First time flying with Etihad, the Apartments were impressive. I love the menu, I had a little bit of everything. I had seat 4A and it was pretty comfy for me, despite it not fully recline it was still good. I like how the partition came down for seats 3A and 4A, friend and I played Smash Bros throughout the flight. First time taking a shower in the air, it seems unreal. Tried to get a tour of the Residence but they used it as storage so no tour.
W Maldives | 240k Marriott Points 5 nights |I originally had StR booked but since I went there before I really wanted to experience a new property. Originally booked into a beach villa but got upgraded to overwater villa, I think having Plat helped. I’m not a huge of the hut style overwater villa look, I much prefer StR’s modern design. W’s overwater villa desk is very very impressive. Room is much smaller than StR but still nice. My only complaint is that the rough construction material of the pool gave me a few cuts throughout my stay. Also breakfast not was an impressive as StR. Budgeted $4000 but only endeding up spedning around $2k. Thank the churning gods for the Marriott Plat from the ritz. Also a very very interesting note about trying to extend my stay below.
SriLankan Air|14.k Avios MLE-CMB-SIN|This has been my usual route leaving or going to MLE. After fees, it was a bit over $100. For those who don’t want to pay a full fare like me might want to take a look at this route.
JW Marriott Singapore South Beach|50k Marriott Cert from Ritz card|Needed a night in Singapore so I opted to use my Ritz cert as I didnt want to pay for a night at Marina Bay Sands. Very very nice hotel. The pool has a great view of downtown Singapore. Breakfast was a good option as well. I’d stay here again. Not much else to stay as I got in late and left the next day.
SQ First Class Suites(new suites) - SIN-LHR|210k SQ Miles|I figured since I was so close to Singapore, I might as well try and go for the new Suite Class. Saver waitlist and Standard opened up for SIN-LHR, as I did not know how I’m getting back to JFK yet, I did not want to wait it out for Saver so I opted to do a full standard award.The suite is so much spacious than Etihad. Not a huge fan of the chair mainly because the old suites’ chair was very very very comfy. The bed itself is a bit wider than Etihad. I got seat 2A, was hoping no one was in 1A for double beds but someone was there. The FA indulged me and made the double beds for me upon landing in LHR. It looks fantastic. I don’t see how you don’t want to try to join the mile high with the two beds, let alone the huge ass bathroom.
Lufthansa First Class - LHR-FRA-HND|115k UA Miles, $300ish in fees|So I was in LHR, figured I could find a way back home to JFK easily but I realized I was in Europe and could position myself to FRA to check out Lufthansa First Class. Originally thought to grab LH back from to JFK but its a short ass flight, not enough to enjoy it. I was looking at other longer route options. My friend did want to go back to Tokyo and potentially I could fly back to Asia and meet up with him. 2 weeks on the dot, United saw LH F availability to HND, I booked that shit asap. LH’s First Class Terminal is impressive, the personal attendant made me feel extra rich. Bathroom is not as impressive as Cathay’s Cabanas. I indulged in a whiskey tasting with their full bar. Man was I drunk. I was so drunk I didn’t realize we took off on the flight. My personal favorite is being driven to the 747 queen of the skies. The personal handling to the car from immigration and checking in was so cool. I got seat 2k up in the front of nose. I realize this wasn’t the best seat for photos due to the angle and I had to use some space from my neighbor. He never said anything but I like my personal space so I don’t like taking up anyone elses. Slept for most of the flight, never drinking that much whiskey again an hour before flight time.
Hyatt Regency Tokyo|12k Hyatt points|Meet up with my friend in Tokyo. He was staying 5 nights so I booked the first night under my name and 4 nights under his. Got him club room access and a Mt Fuji view, I came in the second night. Very very nice looking lobby. Can’t say much else cause I didn’t do anything else there beyond sleep. As my last time in Tokyo, I got a membership to Wagyumafia and I was putting it to full use. I’m able to bring a guest in for dinner with me and had a 10 courses of wagyu with a huge ribeye to share for main course. We could not finish it. $600 dinner for two. Only stayed 30 hours in Tokyo, my shortest stay and fifth time in Tokyo.
Japan Airlines - NRT-JFK|80k AA Miles|Finally heading back home. Not much to say as I flew with them before. Classic Japanese customer service nothing but good things. Though cabin temp was a bit on the warmer side. They ran out of the Queen of the Blue tea, guess everyone drank it all, I certainly did. It was a full cabin 6/6. 



**Notes**

• This trip was mainly about taking advantage of Marriott’s 60k rate before it went up. Round the world trip just happened to happen.


•Most of the flights did not come together until 2 weeks out. It was fun piecing together this trip in such a short time.

•Entire route, JFK-AUH-MLE-CMB-SIN-LHR-FRA-HND-JFK 

•Btw picking SQ Suites or Etihad Apartment, I'd go for the Suites. Much roomier, SQ service and bed is a bit wider. I nearly fell over on Etihad.

•I checked off 3 new first class flights off my list, that was fun. Would love to LH again.

•Including my friend's flights/stay, this vacation retailed over $100k. I can now say I've been on a $100k vacation.


**W Maldives Extended Stay notes**


So I fucked up on my dates and ended up checking out early than I thought. Ended up staying one night in Male City. Heres the interesting part, the W welcome manager gave me the rates if I wanted to stay extra. Of course I did not want to pay cash so I said no. A little way later he called back and asked if I declined because of the rates and no award stay was available, I said yes and he said he’ll contact Marriott to see if he can release a room. W was at full capacity so no beach villas was available too. He said due to their “threshold” they could not release any more rooms and needed Marriott’s permission. They were trying to upsell a WOW escape suite to a upcoming guest, if he took it, I could’ve kept my overwater, if not, they could’ve moved me over to the WOW suite. Of course Marriott would deny this cause they would’ve needed to reimburse W at the suite rate. This was very interesting bit of news to me.

43,South Africa Award Booking Success,54,cjx69d,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cjx69d/south_africa_award_booking_success/,39,2019-07-30 23:59:25,"I just finished booking five people (myself, fiancee, her parents, and her brother) to South Africa for 12 days in May/June 2020. This is their first-ever family trip outside of North America. My fiancée has flown J and F several times, but the others have never flown J or F. 

**Flights to Cape Town**

* Four people are flying Qatar Airways Business Class from ORD to CPT with 15.5-hour layover in Doha for 75k AA + $19 per person (reserved a quad QSuite).

* One person flying is Qatar Airways Business Class from JFK to CPT with a 1-hour layover in Doha for 75k AA + $15. 

* QSuites is on both the US to DOH routes.


**Flights Back from JNB to USA**

* Fiancee's parents and myself are flying Etihad Business from JNB-ORD with a four-hour layover in AUH for 75k AA + $67 per person (no QSuites awards available to any US airport 331 days out for +- 2 days)(I also added a flight on AA first from ORD to LAX on her parents' award by calling in). 

* Edit: Switched Fiancee's parents from JNB-LAX on Etihad J. 

* Fiancee is flying JNB- Sao Paulo in SA Business, then Sao Paulo to Toronto in Air Canada business, and then Air Canada Economy to San Diego for 80k United + $80. (the goal is to get to LA, but LA was 190k and San Diego was 80k. We are still going to continue to monitor award space to try to improve it.)

* Fiancee's brother is flying JNB-ADD-FRA-HND-ORD. Two segments are in ANA FIRST Class and two segments are in Ethiopian “Cloud-Nine” business class (2-2-2 on A350-900). He will have a 7-hour layover in Frankfurt to experience the Lufthansa Senator Lounge and 4 hours in Tokyo-Haneda to experience the Suites Lounge. The total cost was only 103,000 Lifemiles plus $122 in taxes and fees. (Manual booking via email; really happy I got him two segments in ANA F in a single one-way award since he will be graduating from medical school right before this trip)

**Total Cost for 5 People=** 600k AA, 80k UA, and 103k LifeMiles plus $484 in taxes and fees plus about $100 to buy some extra LifeMiles.

**Things I Learned in the Process**

* LifeMiles has really relaxed routing rules. You just have to make sure the connections are less than 24 hours and your one-way trip is less than four calendar days (They rejected JNB-IST-FRA-HND-ORD since that trip would be last four days). 

* For LifeMiles, search each segment on their website and put together a few potential routings. I then emailed them several as my first, second, and third choice group of routings (support@lifemiles.com).  It takes 2-3 days to do a manual booking so award space could disappear in the process, which is why you should send multiple potential routings. It can take longer if you request near the weekend since the person who prices it doesn't work on the weekend. It also took me 5 calls over 3 days to pay the taxes and fees since there is only one guy who handles that and at many times he was busy or on break.

* After your LifeMiles award is on hold, transfer or buy points during a sale to get to the required amount. The rate that LifeMiles quotes to sell you points as the “flexible payment” option is pretty high. I was short 10,000 miles, so I transferred 5k and bought 5k at around 1.6 cents rather than the quoted 3.2 cents.

*  The website Flight Connections is really helpful for creating LifeMiles awards since it shows you where airlines/alliances fly. I knew I wanted to try to get ANA First class, so I found award space to the USA and then worked my way backwards using Flight Connections for possible routings from there (and then checked award space). 

* For United, check nearby airports for awards. We saved 110k miles by routing from JNB to San Diego over LAX due to their new dynamic award pricing. 

* There is a lot of phantom award space on AA.com with Qatar and Etihad, so be sure to click all the way through to the payment screen to verify. 

* ~~AA or Etihad seems to be blocking award on Etihad to LAX. Etihad's system shows 2 ""Guest Business"" seats and AA.com errors out when you try to book them (call center can't book either).~~ Edit: Called the Australia call center and they switched the award to JNB-AUH-LAX thanks to everyone's comments. 

* For AA, all the segments must be 331 days out. I tried to book US-CPT on the 331st day, but I had to wait until 330 days to book the entire thing do to the second segment being a day later.

* AA online award hold is really helpful and you can hold an award for about 4-5 days. I found it helpful since you could add domestic positioning segments on AA metal to the award on hold that could not be booked online as one award. I also learned I  could have used the award hold to reserve the US to DOH in QSuites segment and then called in the next day to reserve the DOH to CPT segment (on the 330th day at midnight, award space was disappearing fast as people were booking the entire one-way flight).

* It is really helpful to use BA's award booking system (which can see award space much further out than AA) to see what will become available on the 331st day on AA.com.

* QSuites does not operate on the PHL route in the summer. That route had a lot of award space in the older business class. I also learned that a free Expert Flyer account can see the seat map (a lot of people think you need the paid subscription) or you could search US to DOH on QatarAirways.com and look for a gray Q icon next to business class price (or click the business class price and look at the picture).

* There seems to be never any QSuites award space to/from LAX. 

Overall it should be a great trip. We are planning on spending 5-6 days in Capetown and the remainder for a safari somewhere.  If you have any safari recommendations, please let me know."
44,Award flights to South Korea seem really difficult,4,b9e9zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/b9e9zx/award_flights_to_south_korea_seem_really_difficult/,29,2019-04-04 19:38:04,"We're looking at PDX - ICN (Seoul) in about a year, ideally in business but premium economy in Air Canada might work too depending upon aircraft type.  Overall, it seems like one of the toughest award routes to book when controlling for first world countries:

&#x200B;

\-Korean Air, which is notorious for having the toughest award availability

\-Air Canada, which is slightly easier but rarely competitive compared to Tokyo/Singapore

&#x200B;

We'll have a random mix of miles and points (120K in MR, 60K in Chase, 200K Marriot), is the best bet to hope for some sort of partner airline (i.e. United) to run a sale and be able to book Air Canada via United? Hopefully I'm missing something."
45,To F or J on ANA? That is the question... Pics and review of IAH-NRT route,52,89vty8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/89vty8/to_f_or_j_on_ana_that_is_the_question_pics_and/,30,2018-04-05 06:03:22,"Bit of a backstory here: I never really intended to fly ANA F, but since I was prepping to close my Citi Premier card, I had to dump my TYP somewhere. As fortune would have it there was a 25% transfer bonus from Citi -> VS at the time and it left me with enough points to book F when normally I’d have just booked J. So I figured why not let’s compare the 2 cabins. This turned out to be a good thing since I wound up having to change the dates of the trip in January and when I went to rebook it only about 60 days in advance, there was zero J in sight on my route, limited F, but it was there for peak cherry blossom season.

All pictures and viewpoints are from the 777-300 and the IAH-NRT route. All window seats since I was traveling solo.

Here is the IMGUR album link, so follow along, I’ve posted the pics in the same order as the text. It would be a lot more user friendly if reddit would allow in line posting of images, but what can you do… Unless otherwise noted, F pics are on the left, J pics are on the right.

https://imgur.com/a/RvPu6


**Check in and departure at Houston** (no pics)

Sorry to combine this, but they’re the same in either class. While there is 1 dedicated F and 2 J check in counters, all were occupied when I arrived. Either way the wait was minimal and handled quickly, much like last year. ANA uses the United Club as their lounge which is unfortunate for many reasons, mainly because it isn’t very good. Until the IAH Polaris Lounge is ready, the Centurion Lounge remains the best lounge at IAH if you have a qualifying Amex card. I went to the UC to check it out since I had the time, but quickly left. The breakfast spread was weak and the lounge crowded. The CL has infinitely better food and better drinks. Not to mention it’s closer to gate D5, which is the one ANA uses at IAH. Even once the Polaris Lounge opens, I wouldn’t expect there to be any difference for ANA F vs. J since United is phasing out their own F cabin and Global First lounges.

**Check in and departure at Tokyo** (no pics)

The differences here are that F pax are allowed to use the Suites check in which is under the Z letter at NRT Terminal A. Biz pax have their own dedicated lanes in the normal area. F pax have a dedicated security checkpoint (I was the only person in it), while Biz have access to the Gold Track lane. Neither class has access to a dedicated immigration checkpoint, which IMO would have been more useful than a dedicated security checkpoint.

With an F BP, you get to use the ANA Suites lounge vs the biz class side. They are two sides to the same general area (walk in and take a left to go to biz, take a right to go to suites), the main differences being the Suites lounge is far less crowded and has a self serve buffet of hot food, which the biz doesn’t. One review of the Suites lounge I found online said it would be “a fantastic business class lounge” which is a pretty fair summary since it lacks many of the traits of other top tier lounges, like table service for meals, spa amenities, etc. that you’d find in CX, EK lounges. Hell even AA now has table service Flagship First dining in LAX and JFK. (There are some pictures of the ANA Suites lounge below in the ANA vs JAL comparison I link to)

**The seat**

So first vs biz has long been summed up as seat and service are the real differences. So let’s address the seat. My thoughts: it’s very comfortable, it’s cloth, and while it’s wide, it isn’t anywhere near a crazy width (ala Cathay F), and the seat width is cannibalized by the 5ish inch arm rests on both sides of the seat. See the pic where I used Amex cards for a comparison! Now I’m not a big guy so I don’t terribly care, I fit just fine, I mention it because it got some discussion in the recent ANA J vs F comparison. I didn’t notice much of a difference in seat position vs J in width, but I did in comfort. The ANA F seat is like that comfy recliner you’d had for years, which kind of makes sense, this recliner has been flying around for about 5-6 years. Now this compares with Cathay F, which on the 777 has an absurd seat/bed width. But they also only do 3 across on their 777 in F. 

It’s worth mentioning that getting in and out of the F seat is easier because your pathway is about twice as wide as J.

**The bed**

This probably the biggest hard product advantages of F. As you can see the bed goes fully flat and the bed goes flush with the armrests which take up lot of the space in seated position. Also the footwell is much larger. The ANA I don’t really recall any difference in the quality of the sleep between J and F. As is usual with Asian airlines they kept the temperature a bit warmer than I’d prefer so I barely used the blanket and just had the pyjamas on. The PJs are also way better in F vs the ones I was given in J last year. They’re a lot more comfortable and fit better.

**Dining**

I’m not going to talk too much about this – you can see the pictures. As the prior ANA comparison mentioned, there isn’t much of a difference between F and J as far as the menu goes, besides an extra appetizer course. The main difference is in the alcohol quality, Krug and Hibiki 21 in F, something lesser and Hibiki 17 in J. ANA’s catering is excellent in both cabins and I haven’t had anything disappointing in my 4 flights with them. Both cabins more or less share the same order on demand snack menu. 

You can view the menu for my flight, and any other ANA flight here: https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/serviceinfo/international/inflight/guide/f/meal/ scroll down and pick your departure city.

**Random musings**

IFE – I felt that the IFE selections were kind of lacking for US/western tastes. Unless you like Star Wars, they had a shit ton of those movies available. 

Service – I can’t say I’ve had a negative interaction with any ANA employee yet. They take great care of you, and at least appear to really enjoy their jobs! Their attention to detail is amazing though. On my return flight, one of the FAs who wasn’t the one who served me dinner, was wondering around with a different bottle of red wine from what I originally had. She already knew it wasn’t the one I had ordered, and encouraged me to try a glass of the other red. Part of me wondered if they somehow knew I liked to compare beverages since I had asked for a Hibiki 21 vs 17 comparison on the outbound flight. Also each time you ring the call button, they appear out from behind the curtains in only a few seconds. 


**Overall conclusions**

As far as booking, I can really only recommend F > J as long as the VS award chart lasts, and personally I think it’s ripe for getting “enhanced” away. I don’t think there’s a single better value out there for true international first class, and when you think that Citi and Amex occasionally have transfer bonuses to further reduce the cost, I just think it’s too good to last. If you intend to take advantage I’d plan to do it sooner rather than later. The cost differential using United miles (220k r/t in F vs 160k in J) or ANA’s program (150k r/t F vs 75-90k J) is way too big to be worthwhile. Personally I’m not even sure I’d book F instead of J via VS unless there was a transfer bonus that allowed you to basically pay for J and get F. 

So where do these products rank for me? While ANA has an undoubtedly solid F product, it’s not the best I’ve flown. The ground service and lounge amenities are somewhat lacking, the hard product is a bit dated, I think this F cabin is unchanged since it came out at least 5-6 years ago. A friend flew ANA F from Japan to NYC from this same trip, he hadn’t flown it since 2013, and said nothing’s changed. Finally, while not an issue for me since I’m forever single, it’s not an ideal product for couples. What it makes up for is trademark fantastic Japanese service and excellent crew, very good food and booze, and a comfy seat and bed.

Personally I don’t think there would be anywhere as much hype about ANA F if it weren’t for the really good value of booking through VS, and the fact that Japan is an awesome place to visit. I’m not trying to belittle ANA F, it’s just that I think the largest failing ANA F is only incrementally better than J. The meals are mostly the same, both cabins have all aisle 1-2-1 access, and the ground experience is almost the same. 

Emirates still takes the #1 spot for me, Cathay follows at #2, and ANA now at #3. But let’s talk J products. ANA is 1st in my long-haul J ranking, followed by Virgin Australia in #2, Delta’s A350 in #3, AA at #4, and Thai in a distant #5. 

Up on the travel docket for the rest of the year as far as new products go, assuming no changes, are QF J, TG F, CX J, and JL J, all in one wacky trip. Of those I’m most excited for TG F on the 747 and JL J. 

**Another resource to look at ANA F**

I didn’t write this comparison, but a user on Flyertalk posted this comprehensive comparison of ANA F vs JAL F. I haven’t yet flown JAL F, so I personally can’t attest to the conclusions, but I don’t disagree with any of his opinions about ANA. https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trip-reports/1857800-comparing-jal-ana-first-class-better.html


**NRT vs HND**

I see lots of people online talk up the superiorness of HND because it’s closer. On this trip I finally had a chance to use HND for a domestic flight (ANA Y, which I haven’t covered here, if you have any questions feel free to ask away).

Fun fact about domestic flights in Japan, there are no liquids restrictions, so you can carry your water bottle through security. Beer would probably be cool too, given Japan’s lack of laws prohibiting open containers of alcohol. 

Ok yeah it’s closer to downtown, but damn does the monorail get crowded around rush hour time, and you’re still probably going to need to transfer from the monorail or the Keisei line to another subway or JR line to get your destination. I still like the NEX train because you’re guaranteed a seat, which isn’t necessarily true on either transit line to HND, there is free and fairly fast WIFI, and if you are staying in the main areas of Tokyo like Shinjuku or around Tokyo Station, you don’t have to transfer lines.

However, I was giving my wife a vacation as a gift and challenged myself to get all the flights with miles... in either J or F.  If you go back in my post history a little over a year ago, you see me asking questions in the megathreads about redemptions.  They gradually shape into my final itinerary as I learn about certain routes and their availabilities.  Around 330 days before my trip, here is what I purchased (all dollar amounts are USD):

    Itinerary #1
    Dep       Arr       Date      Class     Airline   Miles     Taxes
    SEA       LAX       Apr 20    Y         AS        55k/pp    $125.00/pp
    LAX       NAN       Apr 20    J         FJ
    NAN       AKL       May 01    J         FJ
    (bought with AS miles)

Free stopover in Fiji thanks to Alaska Airline's award ticket rules!  Woo!  We happily spent 9 days in the Yasawa Islands in a village homestay.  The village we stayed in fed us everyday (each meal with a different family!) and we got to work alongside many of them throughout our time there (scraping coconuts, fishing, going to school).  Very, very awesome stopover.  [Picture of our hut](http://i.imgur.com/WapFamP.jpg)

We then did a week in New Zealand.  In retrospect, I wish I had done a week in Fiji and 9 days in NZ.  Still, we rented a car and had a total blast.  Glow worm caves, Hobbits, thermal pools... the whole time was intensely amazing.  [Picture of our rental car and one of the lookouts we stopped at](http://i.imgur.com/WrPj4o6.jpg)

    Itinerary #2
    Dep       Arr       Date      Class     Airline   Miles     Taxes
    AKL       BNE       May 07    J         QF        17.5k/pp  $61.30/pp
    BNE       CNS       May 08    J         QF

This kind of sucked.  :(  Originally, we had a AKL-SYD-CNS flight booked for May 06 but QF cancelled the AKL leg about 3 months before departure.  As soon as I got the notification, I scrambled to find a replacement (all outbound QF AKL flights on May 06 were cancelled for some reason) for the next day to get to CNS.  Plenty of flights got us halfway there but they were all later in the day, forcing us to take an overnight stopover in BNE.  It wasn't the biggest deal but it did eat one of our vacation days.

Once we got to CNS, we hopped aboard a liveaboard yacht and scuba dived the Great Barrier Reef for 4 days!  The amount of wildlife was insane!  Like, imagine thousands of fish swimming around in a tightly packed school...  I got to swim in that!  Giant clams, sharks, manta rays, sea turtles, fish, fish and more fish.  There were so many different kinds of fish.  The weirdest thing was how much the fish either didn't care I was there or how keenly curious about my presence.  There were some potato cod (100kg fish) that followed me around and would occasionally bump into me, as well as schools of travelli (50kg fish) that would swarm around me.  Surreal.

We had a couple hour layover in MEL, so we went to the QF lounge.  The grumpiest lady was working the front desk.  I wasn't sure if we got access with our tickets, since we depart on a Y ticket (single cabin flight).  The lady (her name is Mel, if you visit this lounge frequently) wouldn't even let me finish my question!  I thought there might be some exception as I bought the itinerary in business, there just was no business class on our outbound flight.  She cut me off 3 times, telling me we don't get access because the outbound ticket isn't business (never letting me tell her about my itinerary).  Fine, you want to play that game?  I abruptly stopped talking and stared at her as I pulled out my wallet and gently placed my AA Admiral's Club membership on the desk and slid it towards her. She begrudgingly let us in.  It was our only bad experience in the whole trip.

We rented a car again while we were in Tasmania and man, this state is absolutely beautiful.  Most of Australia is a desert but Tassie is lush and green and full of wildlife.  Just like in NZ, we had an grand time.  Wineries, creameries, wildlife sanctuaries, hiking, kayaking.  We saw a platypus in the wild!  We even got to pet a wombat at the wildlife rehabilitation center!!  The weather didn't really cooperate on this part of the trip, as it rained nearly everyday.  Luckily, the rain goes in 10-15 minute spurts and we got plenty of time in the wilderness.

My wife and I mostly backpack, stay in hostels or stay with airbnb when travelling through countries.  We are not fancy people.  However, giving her the ability to travel in comfort was important for me, which is why we flew in J or F (her first time in J/F!).  That being said, I wanted to give her at least one night in a really fancy hotel.  So, I used one of my free Hyatt nights for the Park Hyatt Sydney.

Earlier that day, we went to Bonorong (about 30 min from HBA) and saw a bunch of animals.  This includes a big field with over 100 kangaroos.  I didn't realize until we got there that we were actually in the field with the kangaroos... and they give you some food to feed them.  My wife and I were swarmed (in the cutest way) by these forest kangaroos.  It was a ton of fun to feed and pet them!  However, we kind of lost track of time and by the end of it we were covered in mud and kangaroo poop.  We then had to go straight to the airport so we didn't miss the flight and the HBA QF lounge it too small to have showers.

So not only did we fly J in our backpacking outfits covered in kangaroo poop, we also took the train into Sydney and walked to the Park Hyatt Sydney.  We were sweaty, stinky and covered in poo when we walked up to the front door.  I give the front concierge props because he didn't miss a beat and quickly took our bags and helped us check in.  The front desk lady escorted us to our room and the bellhop quickly followed with our bags.  Thanks to my Hyatt status, our room was upgraded and we got a fantastic view of the harbor and the Sydney Opera House.  My wife was super overwhelmed with the hotel because it was so nice.  On the very same vacation we stayed in jungle bures that didn't even have a floor... and now we are in a fantastic 5 star hotel!  We washed off the poo, walked around the city for a couple hours before a late dinner and finally bed.

Our flight home [(in-flight food report)](http://imgur.com/a/PPJ1E).  I was actually in Copenhagen when the 330 day mark hit, so the time difference let me comfortably purchase this ticket while eating breakfast (instead of having to stay up until midnight PST).  I was watching these like crazy the week or two before hand and noticed that no seat was available for more than 5 minutes.  I had to buy fast if I wanted to secure these very, very desired seats.  Fully flat lay down seats on a 14.5 hour flight?  Yes, please.  I felt like UA gave us better hard products (amenities kit, seats, entertainment) but worse customer service.  It wasn't bad... it was just not as good.  FJ flight attendants were the friendliest by far.

My wife really liked having lounge access every time we were at the airport.  The biggest reasons were free coffee (QF lounges have a barista!!  All others had a machine), free wifi and a clean place to pee.  I have had lounge access for quite some time, so I guess I am a bit used to it... but my wife loved it!

So all in all, it cost me 360k miles and $610.60 for 2 people to fly.  Here are the cards I signed up for to achieve this (it doesn't add up because I had some miles from flying that I used as well):

    Card                         Sign up bonus   Annual Fee    Statement Credit
    United MileagePlus Explorer	 50000           $0            $0
    Ink Plus	                 70000           $95 (waived)  $0
    Alaskan Airlines #1	         25000           $75           $100
    Alaskan Airlines #2	         25000           $75           $100
    Alaskan Airlines #3	         25000           $75           $100
    Alaskan Airlines #4	         25000           $75           $100
    Alaskan Airlines #5	         25000           $75           $100
    Citi AAdvantage Executive	 75000           $450          $0
    Barclay Gold                 0               $995          $1093
    Chase Hyatt                  2 free nights!  $75 (waived)  $0
    Total                        320000          $1820         $1593

I also got 2 Global Entry credits, a $200 travel credit, and an AA Admiral's Club membership.  I wouldn't have done the Citi Executive card except I wanted to run an experiment (still running) to see if I can actually get $450 of value out of it.  It is sort of subjective because I don't know what a small plate of veggies is worth but somethings like the beer/spirits are easy to tally.  I enjoy these sorts of things, so it was worth the $450 annual fee (I mean, there were also the 75k miles out of the card...).

If you count the $450 Citi Exec annual fee as a cost of the flight as well as the $25 statement credit gains on the AS cards, the total cost of the flights comes to $837.60.

As far as CPM goes, I was never really that concerned about maximizing it.  I just wanted an awesome vacation (and I got it!).  That being said, I set up a script to pull the cheapest available tickets for a given class over the course of a month (90 days to 60 days prior to departure).  Given these cheapest ticket prices, I calculated my CPM on economy (what I would have paid) and first (just for fun) by taking the total, subtracting the amount paid ($837.60) and then dividing by the number of miles spent (360000):

    Part            Y           J/F
    Itinerary #1    $979.00     $3540.00
    Itinerary #2    $213.00     $504.00
    Itinerary #3    $197.00     $673.00
    Itinerary #4    $91.00      $619.00
    Itinerary #5    $697.00     $1658.00
    CPM             $0.010      $0.037

The hardest part of planning and redeeming this whole trip was finding award availability.  April and May are shoulder tourist seasons, so I had an advantage there.  I wouldn't even attempt this Dec-Mar (peak tourist season) because I doubt you'd find anything available.  I noticed that FJ is particularly bad about this (never releasing award seats for peak tourist seats but releasing literally all seats to award during non-peak season).  It was a ton of work but it was really worth it.  The trip was awesome and I feel way more knowledgeable about international award bookings now.

47,2020: Year of Festivals,33,9z9q3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9z9q3h/2020_year_of_festivals/,38,2018-11-22 05:03:16,"I work for myself and am able to work remotely, so I have a lot of travel flexibility.  I had this crazy idea about traveling in the year 2020 around a  festival/event theme: going to places with some of the more interesting cultural festivals/events around the world.  The tentative schedule I've put together:

&#x200B;

Tuna throwing festival in Port Lincoln, Australia: January 26

Snow festival in Sapporo, Japan: February 3 - 10 (EDIT: now thinking of dropping this in favor of the Olympics in July/August in Tokyo)

Battle of the Oranges in Ivrea, Italy: February 22 - 25

Chiditarod in Chicago, USA: March 7

Calcio Storico in Florence, Italy: semifinals in early June, final is on June 24

Euro 2020 football (soccer) tournament throughout Europe: June 12 to July 12

EDIT: Now looking at adding in the Tokyo Olympics in early August and then the Fringe festival in Edinborough in mid August

La Tomatina in Bunol, Spain: August 26

International Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque, USA: October 3 - 11

Dia de Los Muertos, Mexico City (or Oaxaca), Mexico:  November 2

Cayman Pirates Week, Grand Cayman: mid November

&#x200B;

So I can't just travel the whole year, but there are some distinct trips that I feel like I could build with this agenda.  I'm thinking:

&#x200B;

**Trip 1**

January 19ish: fly to Melbourne and go to the Australian Open.  One of my bucket list items is to attend all 4 tennis grand slams...so far I've done the US and the French.  If I'm going to Australia in January anyway, this seems like a no brainer.  I've been to Australia before but only Sydney and Cairns.

January 25: fly over to Port Lincoln and attend the tuna throwing festival

January 27: Fly to New Zealand.  I've never been and it's high on my list.

February 7ish: Fly to Sapporo and attend the closing couple days of the snow festival.  Maybe I could spend a few more days in Japan...not sure where else I'd go in Winter.  I've been to Tokyo and Kyoto before.  EDIT: Now thinking of dropping this out of the trip and heading straight from New Zealand to Rome.

February 11ish: Fly to Rome, which I've been to before but it's been 20 years.  Head down to southern Italy which I've never been to before.

February 21ish: Head up to Ivrea which is near Turin and attend the Battle of the Oranges.

February 26ish (or maybe I spend a bit more time in Europe): Fly home to Chicago.

March 7th: Attend Chiditarod.

&#x200B;

**Trip 2**

Mid May: Fly to Europe.  Hit up some places I'd like to go: Switzerland (never been), Paris (would love to go back to the French Open), Venice (never been).  Then go to the Calcio Storico in Florence for the semifinals in early-ish June (dates TBA).  Then on to a group stage Euros match

Mid June: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

**Trip 3**

EDIT: Now thinking of flying to Tokyo in early August for the Olympics then heading to Edinborough for the Fringe Festival before proceeding on to Spain.

August 23ish: Fly to Spain.  Work my way over to Bunol for La Tomatina on the 26th.  Then head North and potentially explore non-Paris France (never been), Belgium (never been), the Netherlands (I've been to Amsterdam 20 years ago).

Late September: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

The rest of the events at the end of the year are straightforward flights in/out within North America/Caribbean.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking that I will want to use miles for:

USA to Australia (business)

New Zealand to Japan (business)

Japan to Italy (business)

Italy to USA (economy)

USA to Europe in May (business)

Europe to USA in June (economy)

USA to Europe in August (business)

Europe to USA in September (economy)

&#x200B;

Everything else I think I could just pay cash.

&#x200B;

So of course all these dates are too far out to check for award availability.  But I'd like to talk through my options and what is likely to be available to see if I can pull this off or if I need to make adjustments.  Here's my miles/points stash:

Amex: 95K

Merrill Lynch: 28K

Alaska: 137K (will soon get add'l 40K bonus)

American Airlines: 124K

BA: 6.5K

Delta: 35K

Southwest: 36K

United: 43K (though I suspect I'll need to use 30K for travel in May 2019)

Choice: 8K

Hilton: 47K

Hyatt: 57K

IHG: 20K

Radisson: 119K

Wyndham: 20K

&#x200B;

I've done a little bit of proof of concept award travel search seeing if I could find the awards I need if I was doing this trip in 2019 instead of 2020.  I had success with everything except how to get to Australia with business class.  Of course I am searching just a month and a half out for Australia so that may be why there's no availability.  Here was my tentative plan for paying for this stuff with points.

&#x200B;

USA to Australia (business): I'm not sure how to crack this one because business class award availability to Australia is so tough.  Using Alaska miles to fly Cathay through Hong Kong seems like the most likely option?  If I ended up having a stopover for a couple of days in Hong Kong that would be totally cool as I've never been there before.  I really don't know if availability will be there for January 2020 if I start searching in February 2020.  Unfortunately, this is when I am least flexible in terms of timing: January is my busiest work time of year.  I'm going to work like the dickens the first 2 weeks of January 2020 to put as much to bed as possible but I really can't leave the USA in those first 2 weeks.

New Zealand to Japan (business): Looks like I can do this for just 40K AA miles.  There's availability for this in 2019 on Malaysian Air so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Japan to Italy (business): Can do this for 75K AA miles. There's availability for this in 2019 on BA so I'd hope there'd be availability in 2020.  I was worried the YQ surcharges would be really bad but it's only $200.

Italy to USA (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in May (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in June (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in August (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in September (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

&#x200B;

So I need 95K more Amex points but I figure I can find a way to make that happen.

&#x200B;

**My Questions**

1. Are there any great festivals I'm missing?  I considered Carnivale in Brazil or Mardi Gras in New Orleans, but I'm really just not sure the former is for me, and in any case this Battle of the Oranges seemed too cool to miss.  Though maybe I'm doubling up on that sort of thing if I'm going to La Tomatina.  I've been to Oktoberfest or that would be on the list for sure.  I suppose I could still go back during my Aug/Sep Europe trip.
2. Is there a better way to spend award points to make this trip come together?  Or credit cards I can get to get some points I need to do this better?  I'm way over 5/24.
3. Getting to Australia especially: I'm really concerned that I won't find availability on Cathay with Alaska miles in the tight window I will be looking and then I'm screwed.  Ideas?

&#x200B;

I appreciate everybody's help and sorry for such a long post.

49,Getting a family of 8 to Hawaii on miles aka Wasting a day of my life with Singapore Airlines.,41,5v0abk,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5v0abk/getting_a_family_of_8_to_hawaii_on_miles_aka/,30,2017-02-19 23:36:13,"So over the years I've bugged my Dad into signing up for credit card bonuses. Usually talk him into 1-2 a year. He's done several Chase cards : CSP, Ink+, and CSR (damn you 5/24!) and amassed ~300k UR. Somehow my family decided that they should vacation in Hawaii  this year and so I get a call last weekend from my Mom that she wants to use the points to get everyone to Hawaii. I with a 2M+ points balance offered to get myself there (and on a different plane in first class hopefully...), this left me trying to find 7 RT seats from the east coast for 300k UR points. Didn't have the heart to tell Mom there is a high chance this won't be possible. It's great being your family's travel agent... 

Let the search begin. Nothing at all on AA, same for DL. Somehow, unbelievably, I found 7 UA saver seats on the same flights and they were actually pretty good flights. Non-stop there and sensible layover coming back. The dates even worked for everyone involved!

OK, now how to book these? UA RT saver is 45k to HI, so 7x45k=315k=too many points. But hold on, Singapore Airlines (SQ) is only 35k points and is also a Chase transfer option. 7x35k=245k=I might actually pull this off. To purchase the flights was ~$1,000 a flight, so $7000/245000=$0.028/point, not bad. 

Call up Dad and tell him he needs to get a Singapore Airlines Krisflyer account. He seemed very skeptical about my plans to ""ship my valuable points to Singapore? Where is that?"", nevertheless he does as told and the next day I walk him patiently over the phone how to combine all his points onto the CSR and then transfer 245k to SQ. This is not instant, so now the wait begins with several checks to make sure those 7 seats haven't disappeared.

Next day after work, check his SQ account and the points are there. Let the fun begin.

Call up SQ and say I would like to book 7 seats to Hawaii. The lady informs me that this is not possible. To redeem for someone other than yourself on SQ that person needs to be on your ""Redemption Nominee List"" and that list can only contain 5 persons, so including yourself only 6 persons is possible. Arrghh! OK, I would still consider 6 persons a win, will find another way for #7.

Hang up and log into the SQ account and start putting the names into the online form. Once that is done, called SQ back. Told the agent I would like to book myself (my Dad) and everyone on my ""Redemption Nominee List"" to Hawaii. Could hear right in her voice that she didn't think this would be possible. Spoon fed the flights and to her surprise there was actually availability.  Let's book it! She starts the process then says ""oooh I think there is a problem. In your Redemption Nominee List I see Sally Smith, Smiley Smith, and then Smith Becky. I think you reversed one of the names. No way we can book this"". Arrrggghhh! Sure enough I did mess up one name. 

OK, how do we fix this? Well, you must fill out the ""Redemption Nominee Form"" to make the correction. But you cannot do this online anymore. This can only be done BY SENDING A FAX TO SINGAPORE! AAaaarrgghhh! Pleaded with the agent to put the flights on hold, which thankfully she did, but can only hold for 3 days. It's late so let's try again tomorrow. 

Call up my Dad the next day and tell him to forward the email from SQ. Get the PDF to fill out, but it is not form fillable, of course. Figure out the right program to edit the PDF, add a John Hancock, then went searching the web to figure out how to send a fax to Singapore online. Luckily, HelloFax will let you send 3 free pages of fax to anywhere in the world with a Microsoft account. Fax done!

Next day, ask Dad to check for any emails, get forwarded a nice note from Krisflyer that one of the names doesn't seem right. In the original ""Redemption Nominee Form"" the name was spelled Becky Smith, but in the new faxed ""Redemption Nominee Form"" it was spelled Beckey Smith. ArrghhhhhhhHH! I shouldn't fill out forms late at night and should know how to spell my niece's names. It shouldn't matter since Becky is 8 years old and flying without ID solely within the US. Call up Krisflyer as it's now 10am in Singapore and after much holding and discussion they agree to use the correct name. Should be fixed by by tomorrow. 

OK, next day comes around. After work with <24 hours to get this ticketed I call back SQ. Tell the lady I would like to ticket these. She starts at it then says ""oooh there is a problem. You never paid to change your Redemption Nominee List. That will require US$50"". Pushed back lightly that I didn't ""change"" but only corrected my ""Redemption Nominee List"". She said I should have done this online as it was only US$20. I wanted to scream ""YOU CAN'T DO IT ONLINE THAT IS WHY I HAD TO SEND A F'ING FAX TO SINGAPORE"", but instead I just gave them the credit card details to charge the $50. Was informed she would need to verify this all with Krisflyer and call me back...

Couple of hours later, well after midnight, get a call from Singapore. Let's book this! Had the agent read back the flights on hold, they missed one of the segments on the return... All the availability was still there (thank god) so after some time correcting all the flights we go to book. ""oooh there is a problem. Several of the persons on your Redemption Nominee List have Passport/ID numbers with all zeroes. There is no way I can book this with that"" AAARGHRghghghghggrtllll!! Keep calm, keep calm. I try explain that these persons were young children travelling solely within the United States and therefore did not require an ID or passport. She was having none of this and kept insisting I would need to file a new ""Redemption Nominee Form"" to correct the Passport/ID numbers. She suggested I do it online this time as its only $20. It took every bit of my strength to not scream ""YOU CAN'T F'ING DO IT ONLINE ONLY BY F'ING FAX"", instead I calmly asked to speak with a supervisor. At 2:30am after being on this call for well over an hour she comes back on and says her supervisor found a way to make this work. Minutes later tickets all booked. They even forgot to deduct miles for one of the segments, so there are 52k points still in the SQ account. Finally, Success!

But, there is still person #7 without a ticket. Log onto united.com, find the flights, enter the details and payment, confirmation received. All done in under 2 minutes...

My fiancee and I are looking to go to Japan for our honeymoon and plan on cashing in our United & UR points to do ANA 1st class one way, business class the other (not enough MPs or other points to do another airline). Though the ANA product is pretty isolating, we still want to sit next to each other on the planes. I hold the majority of the points, so we were thinking a have me book the 2 first class and 1 business class, then he books the other business class. Then, once we get our info from United for the ANA flight, we try to select seats with them. Will that work, or is there something else we need to do? Fiancee and I don't live together, so can't pool our UR points. 

Please let me know if that will work. I know this is not the best redemption, but our travel flexibility is very limited.

Spent like 5 hours today trying to understand different stopover/open jaw policies and trying to figure out different regions, and having a lot of trouble and would prefer help. If you have the best route set up for us, I am willing to give you 3 months of gold :)



**Basic details:**


Departure city is either SFO or OAK.


**3 Destinations:**

Japan, Tokyo or Kyoto (10 days)

Seoul (3 days)

Maldives 10 days (OR Bangkok/Ko Phi Phi, but Maldives is significantly more preferred)


Japan and Seoul can be flipped, but would like last destination to be Maldives (or Thailand). We prefer it to be Maldives, but if you cannot make it work, then Thailand would be the alternative.


**Dates:**


Departing July 1st from SFO or OAK.
Departing Final City (maldives or thailand) for arrival ON July 24.


**Points available:**


**Me:**

* United: 20,000 (Gold member, so wider availability of awards)
* Delta: 40,000
* American: 150,000
* SPG: 73,000
* Chase UR: 235,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* AMEX MR: 145,000  (transferable to a lot of airlines)


**Wife:**

* United: 12,000
* American: 64,000
* SPG: 40,000
* Chase UR: 28,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* CapitalOne: 15,600
* Amex MR: 103,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)


How can we make this work? Could really use some guidance. 

Ideal parameters: maximize stopover rules, saver awards ONLY preferred (but if no availability, might have to suck it up), would prefer business class for Departing flight from SFO/OAK.

**United**:

- IAH is a United hub.

- Neat Exclusion Perk

- 10% more miles, so you get 132K United after conversion. I have 50K United (182K United total), plus 200K UR to back that up.

**Alaska**:

- 120K AS miles after conversion

- Stopovers are allowed on one-way awards, meaning you could stop in Hong Kong enroute to somewhere else in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, India, or the Middle East.

- Alaska charges no fees to change or cancel a ticket up until 60 days before departure, so you can lock in a speculative booking now, and then cancel it until close to the travel date

- Cheap Cathay Pacific F redemptions

**Goals:**

- Make the miles last as long as possible

- Fly Biz/F one-way at least once to South America (Peru), Middle East (Turkey, Egypt, Oman, Dubai), and/or SE Asia (Indonesia, Phillipines, Vietnam, Singapore).

**Booking The Trip**

My wife and I were invited to a friend's wedding in Bangkok this past fall - we quickly realized that if we were going to go, we had better make the most of our time there!  My primary goal was to get us there and back in international J, preferably Asia-based carriers, and to have free hotels while in the larger cities.  I managed to accomplish that with the points I had without much trouble, and it made for such an amazing time.  I knew going in that getting good value for points in smaller locations was tougher, and I paid cash wherever I didn't see our point value being realized.

For flights: I found space on Cathay in J flying from EWR to HKG direct without much trouble - searching via British Airway's site for availability, and calling into American was very simple.  Easy as pie to put it on hold as my wife and I finalized getting our vacation days approved and aligned.  

I booked the return flights about a month afterwards - in my research, the best returns from HAN seemed to be Star Alliance carriers, so I got a United Explorer card for a quick 50k United points to combine with my UR points.   I'd read so many good things about EVA, so they were my first priority. Finding the right flight on EVA was difficult, as there was nearly no availability on our dates, but I ended up getting lucky with space for 2 opening up for HAN-TPE-JFK.  My other choice was going to be Asiana, which had loads of availability on most days.

For hotels: I had more than a few stays at Hilton in the last year, which combined with the Aspire giving me Diamond status, netted me a boatload of points.  Booking the Conrad and Waldorf was simple and straight forward.  Hilton's website makes it incredibly easy, and the ""points & cash"" slider is a great feature.

For the other hotels and intra-Asia flights the points options were either not very attractive, points weren't an option, or the cash value was so low that using points would have been a waste.  Think something along the lines of 40k IHG points a night for $110 room.  Another example - a domestic flight on Thai Airways in J for two people for $200 total or 55k United miles.

In essence, we used a lot of points at the very beginning of the trip, then a large gap of no points, then lots of points at the end.

**Taking The Trip**

We took that late evening flight from EWR, which meant a 1:50am departure, landing in HKG at 5:30am.  The wife and I had a long day leading up to the flight with work and frantic packing, so right after the meal service finished I passed out for 10 hours straight, waking up with about 1.5 hours to landing.  Can't complain about a good night's rest, and we landed an hour early at 4:30.

After landing and the most casual immigration procedure I'd ever experienced (guy just looks at my passport and waves me through), we headed to The Arrival until our driver arrived.  Most people online complained about The Arrival, saying it was small and got crowded easily, but after I got solid breakfast and a shower any pre-conceived notions dripped away. Great place to start the day.

I had pre-booked a Blacklane airport transfer, which made getting into the city immensely helpful - we ended up getting our transfer to the Conrad in a Tesla Model S, which was loads of fun.  The Conrad was just beautiful.  The upgraded room with harbor views was awesome to wake up to every morning, and the executive lounge breakfast spread was enormous.  We spent 4 days/3 nights in Hong Kong, doing walking tours all over and eating until our engorged stomachs plead for mercy.  Highlights were the Peak, Cafe 103, old-school dim-sum, Seventh Son, [Bird Market and Flower Market](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bird+Market/@22.3247495,114.174486,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa0bc7e979fe4671a!8m2!3d22.3258908!4d114.1738208) at night, Temple Street night market, and loads of small wonton restaurants. Highly recommend using [Little Adventures in Hong Kong](https://www.littleadventuresinhongkong.com/) for any walking tours - wonderful way to get introduced to a new place.

Our flights to Chiang Mai were on Air Asia, which was a step down in quality from international J on Cathay, but got us from point A to point B in 2.5 hours without any fuss and for a good price.  We used Klook for our airport transfer in Chiang Mai, which was less formal than Blacklane, but still very nice to not have to worry about how you're going to get to the hotel after a flight.  We stayed on the outskirts of Chiang Mai at the Four Seasons, which was one of the most heavenly hotels I've ever been too.  Our upgraded pool villa had it's own 15-meter long infinity pool, private entrance, indoor/outdoor showers, and complete peace/seclusion away from the rest of the rooms in the hotel.  We could have sat on the back porch for hours and hours, but Chiang Mai beckoned.  

That first night, we began the tailoring process (I wasn't going to bring a suit with me!) for a couple of things at [His and Hers Tailors](https://www.google.com/maps/place/His+%26+Her+Tailors+House/@18.7760818,98.9992473,19.23z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x30da3aa7b0e9dded:0xcbb2f60be5fb644d!8m2!3d18.7762722!4d98.9991653).  Mr. Win took care of everything, and worked with our schedule to have several suits and jackets made up in a few days.  Such a great place.  Chiang Mai was a cavalcade of senses and noises, not unlike going to Mumbai or Dar es Salaam, but much much cleaner.  There was very little trash anywhere, and people here were clearly proud of their city.  Tuk-tuk drivers were friendly and helpful without being scammy, and the food was just awesome.  I ate as much street eats as I could take.  One of our days was dedicated to an Elephant Rehab center - I did a LOT of research, trying to find an actually ethical one, and [Patara Elephant Farm](https://www.pataraelephantfarm.com/) stood out.  

Our other days in Chiang Mai were a mix of massages, Wat (temple) sightseeing, streetfood, and painting hunting.  There were a lot of VERY talented painters, and we ended up finding a beautiful pond/koi scene that's now hanging in our front hall!

We had 4 days in Chiang Mai, then needed to get down to Bangkok for the wedding!  I found domestic J tickets on Thai Airways for $200 one-way on a 777-200, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it out!  Service was wonderful, the seats were comfy, and they managed to get in a full meal with separate dessert on a 1.5 hour flight.  I also got a kick out of monks ""cutting"" the line - there were a few signs posted around for this: monks get to go, out of respect, to the front of the line at check-in and security, and also board first.  We had monks on all of our Thailand and Cambodia flights.

We were picked up by another Blacklane in Bangkok, and taken to the Waldorf Astoria.  This hotel is still pretty new, and it showed.  Everything GLEAMED.  It actually hurt to stare at the hotel if you were walking up to it on a sunny day.  The rooms were high-tech; windows, lights, TV, AC, lamps, bathroom fan, etc. was controllable from an ipad next to the bed.  Was fun to wake up, hit a button, and watch the room be bathed in early morning Bangkok light.  Over the three days we were in Bangkok, we spent a good deal of time with the wedding party and the activities around that, but one whole day was dedicated to just my wife and I doing a tour.  Could not recommend [Smiling Albino Tours](https://www.smilingalbino.com/) for private tours enough.  Our guide took care of EVERYTHING for the day, made sure we weren't overheating (was 92+ degrees with like 1000% humidity), gave great history lessons/background to what we were looking at, and was funny to boot.  8 hours whizzed by in a happy blur while walking and riverboating along the canals and klongs.

After the wedding, we had a hungover, dehydrated, and verrrrryyy early flight to Siem Reap in Cambodia - home of Angkor Wat.  However, my hangover was washed away by the ride our hotel was picking us up in.  [Virtoth's Hotel](http://viroth-hotel.com/) sent (for only $30 extra) a 1960's Rolls-Royce to pick us up!  What an experience! It was about 300 feet long, and must have weighed more than all the elephants in Cambodia put together, judging by the noise the suspension made going over bumps.  I had to yell across a chasm of space to have the driver hear us. He may have been seated in a different zip code.  

The highlight, of course, when one goes to Siem Reap is the Angkor Wat temple complex.  Our guide from [Angkor Special Tours](https://angkorspecialtours.com/) on the first day took us to Angkor Wat first, in the afternoon, but from the rear entrance - he didn't want us to see it from the front until we got a chance to at sunrise the next morning.  Having a personal guide (you're probably noticing a theme here) makes all the difference, IMO, in enjoying something.  After Angkor Wat was Angkor Thom, and then about 3 more temples whose name is now escaping me.  ""Temple-itis"" is definitely real, but if you're a history buff, and your guide is willing to explain everything to you, then you'll never stop smiling.

The next morning, we did the quintessential ""sunrise at Angkor Wat"" thing, which was fun, but very crowded.  Glad I did it, but don't need to go back.  The BIG highlight for me, however, was being the first person into [Ta Prohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Prohm).  Our guide managed to get us in a few minutes early, and we had the whole temple to ourselves.  It truly is a magical, wonderful, ethereal place.  Beautiful grey silk cotton trees strangle the rock and edifices and massive roots cascade, web-like, off roofs to form walls of intricately mangled wood.  We got about 30 minutes here to ourselves and it was out of this world cool.

That evening, we flew to Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines on a 737 with about 15 people on it. Fun. It was hellish to get through immigration, and hell again finding our driver, and then hell a third time watching him text, email, call, and drive simultaneously at 100 kph.  Hanoi might have Mumbai beat for insane traffic.  I ran out of fingers and toes to count the near-death experiences.  A quick night's stay at the La Siesta Trendy, and we were picked up the next day at 7am by our driver to head to Ha Long Bay!  It's a four hour drive to Ha Long, so bring a book or stare out the window at endless rice paddies.  

I had booked us onto the [L'Amour Junk](https://www.indochina-junk.com/lamour-junk/) for one night.  This may have been the highlight of the trip for us.  We had been going at a quick pace for almost 2 weeks straight at this point (5 cities in 14 days), but hadn't realized it until we relaxed on the lounge chairs, watching limestone islets and crags slowly pass by.  Our boat was private - just the crew and us - so it enabled us to skip all of the ""touristy"" items that all the boat companies in Ha Long bring you to - we simply asked the captain if we could keep cruising instead of doing a cave tour or whatever and he said ""No problem, it's your boat"" (or something to that effect in Vietnamese).  Even at a leisurely 5kph, the grandeur of Ha Long and Bai Tu Long Bay cannot be ignored.  It feels primordial - like you've been transported back to an earlier version of yourself, millions of years ago.  Our meals on the boat were to die for - fresh seafood and local veggies, and after a bottle or two of good wine sleep came easily and quickly.  Slowly waking up on the boat on the water was a great experience, and stepping back on land was bittersweet - we wished we had more time to spend on the bay.

After getting back to Hanoi, our last day and a half was spent exploring cafes, bun cha joints, and attempting not to die while crossing the street.  The flights back to JFK from HAN were a great way to end our trip - we loved the Song Hong lounge with its enormous windows and great runway views, the Infinity Lounge in TPE had amazing showers and tasty food options, and the piece de resistance: EVA in J from TPE to JFK direct.   I'm not going to be upset about a comfy seat, Krug 2004, delicious food, and Kavalan Whisky.  Flight attendants went above and beyond - after I had finished my dinner, I grabbed my pajamas and went to the bathroom to get changed.  in the 5 minutes I was gone, my entire bed was made up for sleeping, my slippers were placed neatly, and my spare shirt was taken to be hung.  Haven't had that in any other international J product.  We actually made the mistake of sleeping *too much on the flight back - my wife and I slept about 8 hours each.  We took off at 9pm, and landed at 10pm the same day, so we in essence had a full nights' rest then landed at bedtime.  It was two weeks before I wasn't waking up at 4am everyday.

My wife and I absolutely had the best time on this trip, and I cannot emphasize enough how fun, tasty, and enjoyable SE Asia can be.  "

I am a college student from New Jersey. Over the past few years, I have done a lot of travel. In a year alone, I had two trips to Houston and a trip to Guatemala while I was in high school. As my travels might continue to continue, I am noticing the need to sign up for a rewards program that will work around me.

My most frequently used airport is EWR. It's very close to home and fits most of my needs. My most frequently used airline however... I dunno.

Most of the time, we attempt to fly United. My father flew Continental for ages and now tries his best to fly United as they both merged.. Only once in a while will he fly another airline, usually because of the cost. I had a similar situation as some of these trips were paid for by organizations. When I was invited to Houston and Alabama for three competitions, I flew twice on Southwest to Houston and once on American to Alabama.

I also plan on moving south to Maryland which has hubs for both Southwest and United. Nonetheless, I am still unsure how good of a frequent mile program United is and if its even worth considering, however with my more recent travel, I might end up trying it out.

Any thoughts?"

Anyhow, I'll be booking some upcoming paid fares for work soon and trying to figure out how to get the best value from one of these programs.  I know Delta offers Comfort + upgrades to Starwood Plat members, but those are often middle seats it sounds like.  I'm not sure what else may tip the scales in either direction.

One other factor, my home airport is IND which only has one lounge and that is Delta.  I have access to it via the Amex Plat as long as I'm flying Delta, but that's not a huge deal to me if flying United is more beneficial in other ways."
66,Hawaii Trip,1,7ihst6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7ihst6/hawaii_trip/,25,2017-12-08 23:38:31,"I know there are a lot of posts about Hawaii...so here’s another one!

My fiancé and I are getting married in April 2018. We're planning a delayed honeymoon - probably August - October timeframe. Our leading candidate for destination is Hawaii. I've spent the past few days researching all the different ways to get there with points. I have the following points: 260k UR, 130k MR, 40k United, 120k SW, 70k JetBlue, 140k Hilton, 130k Marriott, 80k SPG.

I realize that the cheapest way to get there with points is probably transferring to Korean Air. However, I think I want to book the tickets before we're actually married and I know they have restrictions on that. I know there are a few other cheap options (Air France, British Airways, etc.) but I would really like to fly at least one way in first class. It seems like the best first class going to Hawaii is on Hawaiian Airlines. If we're not flying first class, I would at least like a plane with 2-X-2 seating. I believe that leaves either a 767 or A330. All of Hawaiian's flights appear to be on an A330 with 2-4-2 seating. The only reasonable option I see for a 767 is Delta metal booked through Air France but the availability is a pretty iffy. Also, I'm thinking of using the UR points on hotels. It doesn't seem like MR points transfer as well to hotels.

This is the itinerary I came up with and points/cost for each leg.

* TPA > JFK on JetBlue (Coach for 7.3k or $119 per Person)

* JFK > HNL on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First 80k MR Points per Person)

* HNL > OGG on Hawaiian ($73 per Person - I will try to see if I can get the Amex Plat Reimbursement on these.)

* OGG > SFO on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First $567.33 per Person)

* SFO > FLL on JetBlue (Mint for 33.7k or $449 per Person)

* FLL > TPA on Southwest (8k or $134 per Person)


Total:

* 73.8k JetBlue (for 2 People w/10% Credit from JetBlue Plus Card) ~1.84 cents/point

* 160k MR Points (for 2 People) ~2.09 cents/point

* 16k SW Points ~1.67 cents/point

* $1,280.66 (for 2 People)


Am I being crazy with all of this? Should I just book round trip with Air France or British Airways and likely get stuck in a middle site for 5+ hours?"
67,Going to be doing a lot of NYC to Washington DC travel and looking to maximize points/gain status,12,abq1lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/abq1lc/going_to_be_doing_a_lot_of_nyc_to_washington_dc/,26,2019-01-02 07:53:54,"I'm going to be going back and forth from NYC to DC relatively frequently (maybe 4-6 flights a month? Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"

69,Best Chase UR transfer partner(s) for a frugal domestic US traveler with no set travel plans?,6,97bd24,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/97bd24/best_chase_ur_transfer_partners_for_a_frugal/,24,2018-08-14 23:28:49,"I know that everyone values award travel differently, but I would appreciate your ideas about what to do. I usually travel within the US and I'm more the kind of person that would book the United super saver 7,500/one-way than 200,000 roundtrip (which, now that I think about it, is kind of weird, since I barely travel anymore).

I have saved up a couple hundred thousand UR points over the past several years and will lose my ability to transfer them out this week for almost one year (read: I will be cancelling my cards and will remain 5/24 with an income that is 1/2-1/3 my current cumulative CL until next Summer). My home airport for the next year is RDU, which is serviced by most airlines (https://www.rdu.com/airline-information/rdu-airlines/), and I have already transferred some URs to WN and UA. 

Is it worth transferring more URs to other airlines in case I fly? I was thinking that Virgin Atlantic might be worthwhile, given the possibility of booking award flights on Delta, since Delta flights tend to be more expensive. Of course, there are many other transfer options and I could also sit on the points for the next year, though I worry about sitting on all of them for that long, not knowing when subsequent devaluation/new restrictions (e.g. not allowing transfer of URs between cards) might occur.

70,United discounted upgrade to Biz class?,3,d3ir3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/d3ir3p/united_discounted_upgrade_to_biz_class/,25,2019-09-13 06:40:54,"Hi y’all,

This guy I know from church is always flying around in business/first class on United or Star Alliance metal.

I asked him how he’s able to do that but he keeps avoiding the question. He posted a photo that included his boarding pass so I decided to do some digging.

Turns out he bought his ticket in Economy (fare code T/L) and paid $50 in “Preferred Zone Assignment” charges ($25 one way). His original seats were def in Economy based on the seat number.

But I can see that his current seat is in Biz or First class. He credits his miles to another airline so no way he’s even an Elite member. Looking at the upgrade list 0 people have been upgraded for that flight.

Any thoughts on how this is possible?? Even with him or his family working for a airline I’ve never heard of free/discounted upgrades to Biz class on every paid flight."
71,Worth it to upgrade to First on United 777-200 MUC-IAD?,2,7z9fvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7z9fvz/worth_it_to_upgrade_to_first_on_united_777200/,24,2018-02-22 00:52:57,"Is United Polaris First worth upgrading to for an extra 22.5k points per person on the 777-200 (if it becomes available)?

Our complete itinerary is SPU-IND in August 2018. But on the MUC-IAD leg, we (2 of us) are in biz and they were 57.5k each at the time of booking (before going to 60k). This plane for this leg has changed 3 different times and is now the 777-200 (was originally the Dreamliner going to Newark). I know that first availability only opens up about 2 weeks out and after looking at flights that are 2 weeks out right now, it looks like first saver is 80k. 

I have never flown first or biz and it seems that reviewers for first and biz class for the 777-200s aren't that impressed. However, I wanted to ask you guys to see if we should just stay with what we have now, upgrade to first, or should I use an additional 12.5k for biz on a partner airline (I see Austrian has availability and have read that has a good J product, but I may have to pay a change fee?). 

Any feedback would be great! Thanks!"
72,FAQ: US - Japan,33,3ekcq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3ekcq3/faq_us_japan/,24,2015-07-25 19:13:19,"As I put the finishing touches on my April 2016 LAX - Japan trip, I decided to write a little something something to help others and myself place this popular award travel dream into perspective. The following will set clear some questions that come up a lot both on this subreddit and /r/churning. By no means am I an avid award traveler. This is mostly from my research/FME. No loyalty to an airliner is regarded.

These are some Frequently Asked Questions regarding award travel to Japan from the US. These start very basic and then get a bit more complicated.



**1.) What is the most efficient way to get to Japan from the US via award travel?**

Definitely American Airlines AAdvantage Miles. 

One-way award seats at 25k (off-peak),50k, 62.5k miles for econ, business, first are difficulty to beat. Especially when the competition usually charges high fees. Plus, you earn 10% back on points if you have an AA Aviator Red, Aviator Silver, Platinum Select, Executive credit card open.



**2.) Where are all the US - Japan award flights on AA.com? They are not showing up!**

Many (all?) partner flights do not even show up AA.com. Search on British Airway's (start here), Qantas', or Japan Airlines' award reservation system. Note the flight #. Call AA's reservation line @ 1-800-882-8880. Make sure to tell them the flight is not visible on aa.com, but you know for a fact it exist and is available. The CS rep. should waive the phone booking fee because of this comment.



**3.) I still do not see award flights on the BA/Qantas/JAL award reservation system. How can I get the flight I want?**

Well they obviously exist. Please note that availability is quite low, especially for the business and first class seats. You may have to book close to 11 months in advance to be sure you get the ticket on the dates you want.

Some have had luck booking flights weeks/days before departure. Sometimes additional reward seats are released close to departure. Huge YMMV here. So good luck.



**4.) I do not have enough AA miles and cannot churn to the needed AA miles (for X reason). I got loads of United and Delta points though. What are some of my options?**

United will charge 70k miles for a round-trip award ticket. [Further breakdown regarding partners and ticket type here.](http://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx) Expect much higher fees with United compared to AA. United's reservation system will show most all partnered award flights.

Sorry IDK shit about Delta :D. All I know is its possible. Delta's reservation system will show a decent amount of partnered award flights, and Delta miles are not as efficient as the competition.



**5.) I want to see much of Japan. How much are Japan Domestic flights?**

British Airways will charge 4,500 miles plus a $2 fee for one-way JAL domestic flights. You can travel between major cities via The Bullet Train...



**6.) I want to see much of Japan. Is The Bullet Train worth using when on budget compared to British Airways short haul flights? What is the JR pass and what are its key limitation? How can I get it for free?**

Yes, the Bullet Train (Shinkansen) is worth it if you get the JR pass. The passes start at 29,110 Yen (currently this is $234.02 on 21/7/2015) for the seven day option. 

The JR pass key limitation that we care about is the fact that it can only be bought when outside of Japan and can only be bought my tourists. There are many rules and limitations, but it is still worth. I've read that the Green JR Pass is not worth for the typical tourist.

[Please read through all the rules here.](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/) There are many ways to use the pass and it would be unfortunate to realize a specific thing you wanted to use it for is not allowed.

You can get it for free by redeeming points/""miles"" against the charge. Like on the Arrival +, Cap1 Venture, or other credit cards of the like. Sign-up bonuses for these cards are higher than the cost of the JR pass.

*The JR Pass will code as Tourist Attaction on the Arrival +. You will have to call to get the charge erased with your points. We don't know how the recent changes to the Arrival + effected this option.



**7.) What about award stays at hotels? Any recommendations?**

Redeeming the two free nights [from this Chase sign-up bonus](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/hyatt-card.aspx) at the Park Hyatt Tokyo is a very popular option around here. Book ahead since availability is killer.

The SPG Sheraton in Osaka is an extremely cheap points option @4k points a night.

Cannot go wrong with AirBnB. Japanese hospitality is highly regarded. The host may really help you out here. Statement credit points/miles can be used to cover AirBnB charges.



**8.) What sort of awards can I redeem if I want to fly Singapore Airlines? Should I redeem through United or Singapore if I have the option?**

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles can be redeemed at 32.5k, 77.5k, and 87.5k miles for econ, business, and first class/suites respectfully when flying from West Coast US. [Go here to look at their full award chart.](http://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQMI_OneWayAwardCharts.pdf) Now take into account the 15% miles discount if you book online and Singapore Airlines' legendary service quality. You are getting great value for these options.

Amex MR, Chase UR, Citi TY points, and SPG points can all be transferred to Singapore KrisFlyer miles. So you have a lot of easy churning strategies.

Note that some Singapore Air econ and business tickets are on sale right now (as of 21/07/2015) and may not be worth booking econ with miles. It will always be very worth it to redeem miles for Singapore Business/First Class/Suite award seats.

Also, keep it mind that Singapore Air charges above average fees for award tickets. We talking slightly over $100 for SFO/LAX - HND/NRT business; still worth though.

United will charge less for the econ seat, both in points and fees. Unfortunately, United charges more points for business and first class/suite. Also, United has less availible award seats than their partners on a per partner flight bases. If you don't see an business/first class award seat on United, it may still be open on Singapore.



**9.) What other great business and first class award seats are available?**

The Points Guy talks highly about the JAL First class experience. Plus, its only 62.5k AA miles for one-way award seat. Avalibility is extremely low so book well in advanced. Do a little research on the service and you'll fall in love.



**10.) What are you going to do in Japan?**

73,UA has unexpectedly pulled service between SFO-AKL from April through October this year. Had June 2017 booking (2 J seats) since last Oct. They say we're SOL. Any options at all??,14,5mv8rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5mv8rs/ua_has_unexpectedly_pulled_service_between_sfoakl/,24,2017-01-09 06:09:26,"Have been on the phone with various reps all day today. Some have hung up, some just pretend to transfer me to a supervisor and then hang up, and some are trying to be helpful but clearly have no power. They all say that there is no more J award availability, that literally the only thing they can do is refund my points. Of course, there's no question that we're absolutely SOL if that happens, because there's no longer any award availability even in Y. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

EDIT - How it went down:

This was a UA operated flight redeemed with UA miles. Official details on UA pulling the service are few and far between, but these two before-and-after articles (and the recent updates to the FT thread) are interesting reading: 

1. http://newsroom.united.com/2016-07-01-United-Airlines-Says-Kia-Ora-to-Auckland

2.  J/K! http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11778240

Just a note for any other travellers in this position: The Herald states, (whether of their own accord or via a statement from UA),  ""Passengers who have already purchased tickets during the suspended period are being contacted by the airline and offered flights on the Air New Zealand service instead."" In my experience today, at least for premium award bookings, this is just not true. To begin with, Air New Zealand's akl-sfo craft has slightly fewer premium seats than the 787 Dreamliner. Additionally, it does not appear that they've agreed to open up (m)any? of those premium seats for UA award bookings. We had a couple reps try and book them for us but they were never able to get the override.

u/LumpyLump76, u/aves137, and u/weibelt - I really appreciate your quick responses. I was still on the phone with a manager (finally!) at the time, and it helped me be firm but reasonable in my expectations. 

I truly hope that this goes better for everyone else. The manager referenced the fact that this service change was very recent and said that there wasn't really a plan in the works aside from offering a refund, since they had no way to induce Air NZ to open award availability. But maybe they'll have a decent, legitimate plan in place for other travellers on these flights; maybe I jumped the gun by wanting a resolution asap. 

Here's how it shook out (just received the re-booking confirmation email): Our original booking was AKL-SFO (J), and SFO-DEN (Y). We rebooked for AKL-SYD (Y), SYD-SFO (J), and SFO-DEN (J). For our original cost of 70k UA each, I'm okay with that outcome."

I don't really care what airline it is, but I'd love to maximize utility of my points and also get lie-flat seats (whether that means Business or First, I don't know).

As far as timing goes, I'm hoping to do this in December.

Through the bit of research I've done so far, it seems I probably need to convert my Chase UR to United miles (at 1:1 ratio).

Assuming that's the best route, my questions are:
Do I actually book through United or do I go to Air New Zealand?
How does ""award availability"" work?  Do I stand any chance of accomplishing this and how about this far in advance of the travel date?

Thanks so much!"
75,Trip Report - Cathay Pacific 777-300ER First Class - HKG-ORD,26,48fzs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/48fzs5/trip_report_cathay_pacific_777300er_first_class/,23,2016-03-01 15:22:59,"This was the tail end flight of a 2 week jaunt I had throughout Asia a few weeks back. As always, you can read the whole [report with pictures here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/review-cathay-pacific-777-300er-first-class-hkg-ord/). As a reminder, make sure you are posting up your trip reports - economy included!

This flight was part of the American Airlines award ticket I booked from Singapore back to Orlando. Since this segment was included in my American Airlines redemption, it set me back 67,500 AAdvantage miles. By comparison, paid tickets were running ~$10,200 for a one-way flight on this route in first class, so when you factor in the business class ticket from Singapore and a connecting flight to Orlando, that is an absolutely stellar redemption value.

As we exited The Wing First Class Lounge (which was ""meh"" compared to the incredible The Pier First Class Lounge) we turned left and were pretty much right at our gate. Before you could enter the gate area there was a queue of people where security was “searching” people’s bags. They basically just opened my bag up and moved a jacket over, then re-closed it. It really give me a strong sense of safety and security on this flight.

**Cathay Pacific 806**

**Hong Kong (HKG) – Chicago-O’Hare (ORD)**

**Depart: 11:50 AM**

**Arrive: 12:25 PM**

**Duration: 12 hours, 35 minutes**

**Aircraft: Boeing 777-300ER**

**Seat: 2A (First Class)**


By the time we reached the gate, boarding of all cabins had already begun. There was a separate line for first class, business class and economy passengers. We proceeded directly to the first class line where our tickets were scanned and we were directed down the jet bridge. We entered through door 1L and turned right into the first class cabin. We were met at the door by the purser who directed us to our seats – 1A and 2A.

Cathay Pacific’s 777-3ooERs feature only 6 seats in First Class in a 1-1-1 configuration.

[CX F Cabin Layout](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CX-Layout.png?w=397)

I much prefer seats 1A and 2A as they are the only two seats that share the aisle on the left hand side of the aircraft which makes it feel much more private. The middle seats are completely blocked off, so you really have a sense that you are in your own world.

[Divider On Left Side Of Aircraft](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2567.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After making my way back to seat 2A, I saw home for the next 12 hours.

[CX F Seat](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2539.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

One thing to note about the first class cabin is that there are no overhead bins like JAL offers on their 777-300ERs. Instead, there are little lockers that you can store your bags in. The problem is, they are pretty tight – especially for a 22″ roller bag like I travel with. This locker is also where you are supposed to hang your jacket, which with a bag in there just does not work. Sorry for the poor picture quality of the locker.

[CX F Locker For Bags](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2682.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I ended up needing to place the blanket on my ottoman as it was originally in the locker and would not fit with my two bags – an exceedingly poor design in my opinion. After some finagling I was able to get my two carry on bags stored and started to check out the seat. Waiting at the seat was a pillow which was rather thin.

[CX F Seat](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2537.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

To the left of the seat was the seat controller screen and the in-flight entertainment (IFE) system remote control.

[CX F Controllers](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2541.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The seat controller is a touch screen unit that was not super responsive. I am not sure if that was just my seat, but I consistently had to touch the screen multiple times in different areas to get the seat to move at all.

[CX F Seat Controller](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2578.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Below the seat controls and IFE controller there is a storage area which was relatively shallow, but was good for holding my computer and cell phone chargers.

The seat is incredibly spacious at 36″ of width and features an armrest that drops down from the side of the seat.

I actually really like this feature as it allows you plenty of space if you are lounging in the seat, while also offering you some more traditional seat structure when you wanted to do some work.

Opposite the seat was a nice ottoman which features storage underneath and can double as a companion seat if you wanted to dine with a travel companion.

To the left of the ottoman was an international style power plug along with a USB and S-Video plug.

To the right of the ottoman was the IFE screen, which fits into the storage locker area.

The IFE screen is also a touch screen and swings out and pivots around to wherever you desire.

Also waiting at the seat was the traditional orchid which was real and is a very classy touch.

After getting settled in the in-flight service manager, Alina, came by to introduce herself and welcome us aboard. We were offered our selection of a pre-departure beverage and although I am not really a champagne fan, I opted for a glass of champagne.

[Pre-Departure Beverage](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2543.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We were also offered the traditional amuse bouche, which was a smoked tuna and mango dish that was very tasty.

[Amuse Bouche](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2542.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific serves Krug champagne in their first class cabin. Everyone always raves about it, but I honestly just do not get it. It tasted no different to me than most other champagnes. After the smoke tuna amuse Alina brought out piping hot towels, which was really nice.

[Hot Towel](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2548.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Alina then came back around with pajamas, which were Pye.

[CX F Pajamas 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2552.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific’s First Class pajamas are a burgundy color and really made me feel like an emperor since the top has buttons from top to bottom. They seemed to run true to size.

Also included in the pajama bag were a pair of slippers and a Cathay Pacific branded eye mask.

[CX F Pajamas 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2637.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The pajamas were comfortable and fairly soft, but I have to give the edge to JAL on comfort and softness when it comes to their pajamas.

Alina also handed me an Aesop amenity kit. There were separate amenity kits for male and female passengers.

[Amenity Kit 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2549.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The male amenity kit included a comb, a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, face cream, a glass cleaning cloth, ear plugs and body lotion.

[Amenity Kit 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2641.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Lastly, Alina passed out a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones which were very comfortable.

[Noise Cancelling Headphones](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2550.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

While checking out the cabin I noticed there was a hump in the ceiling which was direct above seat 1D.

[Ceiling Hump](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2558.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cool random fact – that is actually the pilot rest area and there is a little bed up there!

One thing to note about Cathay Pacific’s First Class seats is that while they are in the upright position, it is quite a stretch to reach the ottoman. I am 6’5″ and could barely reach it myself. And yes, those are crabs on my socks – my sock game is on point.

[Stretched Out To Ottoman](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2551.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I spent the remainder of the boarding process enjoying some great views of the 777-300ER parked next to us.

[CX 777-300ER](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2555.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

There also happened to be an older gentleman on the flight who was in seat 2K who had been bumped up from Business Class to First Class. He spent pretty much the entire boarding time calling anyone and everyone he could to let them know that he had been bumped up to First Class. Based on his baggage choice (Rimowa) and his familiarity with the aircraft, he seemed like he was a regular traveler, so the phone calls surprised me a bit. But then again, who among us does not love a free op-up upgrade?!

About 10 minutes before we pushed back, the Australian captain came on the PA to welcome everyone aboard. He also advised us that he strongly recommended that we keep our seat belts fastened as he expected it to be a bumpy ride over the northern Pacific. Within a few minutes the cabin doors were closed and we pushed back.

As the safety video played, my eyes were glued to the window as Hong Kong Airport offers some great views while taxiing.

[HKG Taxiing 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2571.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

[HKG Taxiing 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2563.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We taxied right past the 747 cargo planes, which always makes me happy to see a 747 in the wild.

[HKG Taxiing 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2565.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Interestingly, while we were on an active taxi way, the first officer came out from the cockpit, opened door 1L and then re-closed it. I am guessing this was due to a sensor in the cockpit showing that door 1L was still open, but the re-opening and closing was never explained to anyone. Apparently re-closing the door seemed to work as we continued our taxi after that.

One thing I found very cool is that Cathay Pacific’s IFE system on their 777-300ERs features an outside camera which is mounted on the bottom of the fuselage just behind the front wheel. My eyes were glued to it during the takeoff.

[Exterior Camera View](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2560.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We took off from runway 7R and were quickly airborne rolling out over Kowloon Island and Hong Kong Island. It was a crystal clear day so the views were spectacular.

[Hong Kong Views 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2576.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

About 10 minutes after takeoff the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off. The two flight attendants working the First Class cabin – Joy and Ibuki – then came around presenting passengers with the menu for the flight. The menu was served on a nice wooden plate.

[CX F Menu 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2583.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Since our flight coincided with the Chinese New Year, Cathay Pacific was offering special puddings on the flight to celebrate the Year of the Monkey. Neither sounded very appealing to me, so I never tried either.

[CX F CNY Menu](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2585.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The drink menu was quite extensive as well and featured some very good wines.

[CX F Drink Menu 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2589.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Lunch service began promptly and started with a serving of warm mixed nuts. I opted for another glass of champagne, mainly because I would be trying the caviar again to see if the combination would somehow win me over (spoiler alert – it did not).

[CX F Lunch Warm Mixed Nuts](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2606.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Cathay Pacific puts some kind of smoke seasoning on their nuts which I really just do not care for as it is pretty overpowering.

Joy then came around to set my table, which pulls out from the compartment to the left of the seat. The lunch service started with a tin of caviar.

[Caviar Service 1](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2617.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cathay Pacific serves Calvisius caviar.

[Caviar Service 2](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2618-e1456764270567.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

The caviar was served with the usual accompaniments, a bread basket and a glass of still water.

[Caviar Service 3](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2615.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The bread basket contained an assortment of rolls and a piece of Cathay Pacific’s delicious garlic bread.

[Bread Basket](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2619.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Also served on the tray was a nice hand written note from Joy and Ibuki wishing me an enjoyable flight.

[Note From FAs](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2616.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I thought this was a really nice personal touch.

I have to say though, I just do not get the love that people have for champagne and caviar. I was trying hard this trip to understand it, but I just could not.

After the caviar, Joy brought me a bowl of the cream of chicken soup.

[Cream of Chicken Soup Starter](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2622.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

It was served at the perfect temperature and very tasty.

Next came the mesclun salad.

[Salad starter](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2623.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

It was very colorful and nicely presented, but kind of bland tasting.

For my main course I opted for the pan fried prawns with risotto.

[Pan Fried Prawns 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2626.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The prawns were just ok and somewhat bland themselves and the risotto was more of a rice pilaf than a risotto.

[Pan Fried Prawns 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2625.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After the main course, Ibuki brought me a hot towel and took my order for dessert.

[Post Lunch Hot Towel](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2627.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I decided to be a fat kid for dessert since I could not decided between the berries and cream and the fruit tart – so I ordered both.

[Berries & Cream Dessert](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2628.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The berries and cream were beautifully presented and very delicious. The cream was more of a milky yogurt consistency, but the combination was still excellent.

I also ordered a cappuccino with dessert, which was served with brown sugar cubes.

[Cappuccino](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2633.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Ibuki also brought my cappuccino with cocoa dusted almonds, a truffle and a chocolate bar with almonds in it – all of which were excellent.

[Sweets Assortment](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2632.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The real star of dessert though was the almond pear tart. It was served with salted caramel ice cream and was incredible. It was so good I would literally fly Cathay Pacific again for that alone.

[Almond Pear Tart](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2634.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The lunch service lasted about an hour and a half from start to finish. After lunch I went into the lavatory to change into my pajamas. The lavatories had a somewhat modern feel to them and in the First Class cabin feature real linen towels.

[CX F Lavatory](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2545.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

As with the amenity kit, the lotions and soaps in the lavatory are also Aesop.

[CX Lavatory Lotions & Soaps](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2547.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

One thing I will note is that on our JAL flight, the flight attendants took my clothes and hung them up for me in the closet. On our Cathay Pacific flight that did not happen. I am guessing that is because there is a locker with hangers in it at every seat, but with a roller bag stowed in the there is no room to actually hang clothes. It was a poor layout in my opinion and was another example of why I actually prefer JAL First Class to Cathay Pacific First Class.

After I changed into the pajamas I perused the CX Studio options looking for something to watch while relaxing.

[CX Studio 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2608.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Cathay’s CX Studio selection is quite vast and includes everything from current popular TV shows like HBO’s Ballers to new (to video) release movies like Our Brand Is Crisis. I opted to watch Our Brand Is Crisis and it was quite good.

It is also worth noting that if you are traveling with young children, CX Studio offers a separate kids entertainment section.

[CX Studio Kids](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2613.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

After watching Our Brand Is Crisis, I pulled my laptop out to do some work. I also ordered a glass of the Glenmorangie Signet.

[Glenmorangie Signet 1](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2644.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The Signet was very good and I had several more after that.

[Glenmorangie Signet 2](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2645.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

In fact, I finished half the bottle before I knew it! That made me a bit sleepy so I ended up ~~passing out~~ sleeping for about an hour. When I woke up I decided to watch another movie. This time I opted to watch Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks. Being a history nerd, I thought the movie was excellent. I also ordered another cappuccino which was served with a little biscotti cookie.

[Cappuccino & Biscotti](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2647.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

During the movie I started to get a bit hungry. I had been craving a burger and sure enough, there was one on the snack menu! The snack menu read as follows:

[CX F Snack Menu](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2587.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

When I ordered the burger Ibuki told me it would probably take about 20 minutes to prepare, which was no problem. About 20 minutes later Ibuki brought the burger out with a glass of ice water.

[CX F Snack](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2649.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I gotta say, I pride myself on fully immersing myself in the local culture when I travel, but after 2 weeks, this burger was damn good! The beef was actually cooked to a nice medium, was juicy and very flavorful. I had debated between the British tea trio and the burger since I knew the tea trio was also very good, but I am very happy I opted for the burger instead.

I ended up doing a few more hours worth of work at which time we were approaching the west coast of the Canada. The sunrise from 40,000 feet is always awe inspiring to me.

[Sunrise Over West Coast](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2669.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I guess if I had to pick an office view, this would definitely be the one I would pick.

[""Office"" View](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2671.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

About a half hour later Joy came by to take my order for breakfast. The breakfast menu read as follows:

[CX F Breakfast Menu](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2587.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

I ordered scrambled eggs with fresh fruit, yogurt, a banana muffin and a Hong Kong style milk tea, which Cathay Pacific executes excellently in my opinion.

Breakfast started with a warm towel.

[CX F Pre-Breakfast Warm Towel](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2673.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

At that point we hit some pretty bad turbulence which put a stop to the meal service as the captain asked the flight attendants to take their seats. That lasted for about 35 minutes after which point the meal service was resumed.

Joy came back to set my table and started me off with some fresh fruit and the banana muffin.

[CX F Breakfast 1](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2674.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The fresh fruit was good, though I really do not like the grapes they serve on Cathay Pacific as they contain big seeds.

[Fresh Fruit](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2675.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

The banana muffin was insanely good and was served piping hot.

[Banana Muffin](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2676.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

Joy then came back with my Hong Kong style milk tea which was well executed as always and paired nicely with the banana muffin.

[Hong Kong Style Milk Tea](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2678.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

Next the yogurt was served separately. I had never had this particular brand before, but it was very good.

[Strawberry Yogurt](http://i0.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2680.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After the yogurt, Joy came back with my main course – the scrambled eggs.

[Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Sausage & Potatoes](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2681.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

To be honest, it was pretty disappointing. The eggs were soft scrambled and runny, which I do not care for. The potatoes were soft, mushy and a bit on the chewy side. The bacon was almost entirely fat and the sausage link actually did not look fully cooked when I cut into it. I had a few bites of the eggs and left the rest. It was not quite as bad as the egg dish on Hong Kong Airlines, but it was pretty close.

After I finished breakfast I headed to the lavatory to change out of my pajamas. By the time I had re-stowed my bags and got settled back into my seat we were starting our descent into Chicago.

[Airshow](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2724.jpg?resize=1024%2C768)

I enjoyed some of the views of the Illinois coast as we came in.

[Illinois Coast On Approach](http://i1.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2686.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

It was a pretty clear day and our routing took us right past downtown and the Sears Tower.

[Downtown Chicago](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2688.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

We also ended up with a pretty good view of Navy Pier as we came around on approach.

As we started our final approach into O’Hare, I switched on the nose camera to enjoy the view on landing.

We had a smooth touchdown about 10 minutes earlier than our scheduled arrival time. It was a fairly short taxi to the gate, but there was some cool air traffic on the ground like this Korean Air 777-300ER on its way to Seoul.

[KE 777-300ER](http://i2.wp.com/www.thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2723.jpg?resize=768%2C1024)

After a quick 5 minute taxi we arrived at our gate. We thanked the cabin crew on our way off and then headed for immigration which we cleared quickly thanks to Global Entry.

The crew on this flight were good, but I cannot say that they were great. While both Joy and Ibuki were very nice and extremely attentive, it did not seem like Joy really wanted to be there – and it showed. As is typical with Cathay Pacific, the flight attendants take a more hands off approach to give their passengers some privacy. Though as soon as you hit the flight attendant call button they are at your seat within seconds.

Overall, I think it was a very good flight, though I have to give the edge to JAL on food and service. The Cathay Pacific seat is incredibly comfortable and the IFE system is definitely designed better though so Cathay beats out JAL on those items. At the end of the day though, we are really just splitting hairs here are both are an exceptional way to travel though!"
76,Airline Loyalty Advice,6,5bmwj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5bmwj6/airline_loyalty_advice/,23,2016-11-07 18:57:31,"I'll be starting a new job soon that will have me traveling domestically with about two roundtrip flights each month on average.  I'm going back and forth between American and United for loyalty purposes.  Both seem to provide good coverage to the Midwest (where I'll be traveling most) from my home base, DCA.

I definitely prefer the experience on American over United, and American award flights seem to be better values than United awards, but I'm wondering if I should be more concerned about aligning my CC spend to the airline of choice.  As of right now, I have the whole gamut of Chase UR cards that I love because of their point-earning opportunities and their benefits (CSR, Freedom, FU, Ink, etc), which obviously better suites United.  I do have the Citi AA Plat as well, which I wasn't planning on holding onto past the annual fee but it certainly is an option if it's for the best.  *I plan on keeping my CSR long term as I get to charge all work expenses to my personal cards.*

What I suppose this boils down to are the following questions:

1) I plan to maintain the vast majority of my spend on the Chase cards.  Should I pick United over American since the points are transferable?

2) Should I keep the Citi AA Plat and charge only flights to it?  Does this help me earn status faster?

3) Are there any finer points to this that I seem to be missing?  My priorities are very close between gaining status and getting award flights, but I suppose status squeaks by on top since I can churn my way to award flights for now.

Thank you all for your help!  On a side note, I just redeemed 160k AA for F and 130k UR for J on United for my SO and I to take a Japan trip.  I'll be sure to do a trip report when finished.

77,A Guide to Asia Miles (Cathay Pacific),38,478tp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/478tp5/a_guide_to_asia_miles_cathay_pacific/,23,2016-02-24 00:14:43,"Hello /r/awardtravel,


I'm writing this little guide to Asia Miles simply because, IMO, a decent enough one does not exist anywhere on the web!


I went through hell trying to figure this FF program out the past 3 months and I wanted to share my knowledge so people don't make the same mistakes I did. 


Also for people to understand there is another decent FF program out there that can fly them almost anywhere in the world and at (sometimes) competitive award prices.
The following information includes over 15 calls to Asia Miles, at least 20 hours of hold time, a few months of reading, making many posts on this subreddit(see [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3uoxnx/laxberzag_using_qantas_miles/),[here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/40db5e/mr_and_spg_transfer_to_asia_miles_question/), and [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/42pn5h/asia_miles_cannot_see_aer_lingus_flight_even/) and flyertalk, and over 60 hours of research(mostly trial and error…so much error).


&nbsp;


**Why you should care (pros):**

&nbsp;

* Amex MR, SPG, and Citi TYP are all transfer partners


* Asia Miles partners with many carriers. Here is the most current list: Aer Lingus, Air Berlin, Air China, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Bangkok Airways, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern, DragonAir, Finnair, Gulf Air, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, LAN, Malaysia, Qantas, Qatar, Royal Brunei, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Sri Lankan Airlines, TAM, and US Airways


* You can make a maximum of five stopovers, two transfers and two open-jaws at either origin, en-route or turnaround point (This excludes Iberia and Air China). This means you can get crazy good redemptions with your miles given availability and you do your homework.


* You can mix up to THREE carriers in one redemption when you fly one of your legs with Cathay Pacific or DragonAir. You can mix up to TWO different carriers in a single redemption when you fly all other partners.

&nbsp;

**Why you shouldn’t care (cons):**

&nbsp;

* Terrible customer service and hold times. You have to hold their hand the entire way and then call back every day to follow-up. Don’t ever expect them to get it right the first time. They never once did for me.


* Miles required for some routes are not worth it to many (This is a distance based award system).


* Just because you see a partner on the list that you like doesn’t mean Asia Miles will allow booking on that partner. More on this below.

&nbsp;

*Everything I state going forward is recommended to be done in the order listed. This is important in getting a successful booking and it will make sense towards the end*


&nbsp;


**[Award Charts and Conditions](https://www.asiamiles.com/am/en/redeem/charts#2)**

&nbsp;

CX and KA are on the top chart. 

OneWorld is towards the bottom.


&nbsp;


**Before you transfer, check your route!**

&nbsp;

On Asia Miles website:

* click on **Redeem**


* click on **Flight Award Finder**


* Login


* Enter your Ticket-type(usually round-trip or one-way), destination and departing airports. 


* Then review your airline options. These are the partners you will be able to book with. If they do not show up, they DO NOT fly that route. So even if you know that airline usually flies that route and with award seats on different alliances or their own, it does not mean they open it up to Asia Miles for booking.


* Then click **calculate.** This will be your total cost. As far as I know, it’s been accurate.


&nbsp;


**Searching for award availability**

&nbsp;

*This is where I may need data points.* 



I did my flight for Europe, so I am very familiar with those partners:


Partner| How to find Award Availability 
---------|----------
Aer Lingus | Expert Flyer(flights found on QF or BA will not show up on their systems)
Air Berlin | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
American Airlines | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
Iberia | British Airways Executive Club Award Search
British Airways | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
Qantas | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
DragonAir| Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
Qatar | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online
Finnair | Asia Miles Flight Awards – Redeem Online


&nbsp;


**Transferring points over?**

&nbsp;

*Time Frames and Name Restrictions*

&nbsp;

Membership Rewards | ThankYou Points | SPG
---------|----------|----------
3 – 5 Business Days | 24 – 48 Hours | 4 – 5 Days
Name Restriction Relaxed*| Name Restriction Relaxed* | Name Restriction Strict*

&nbsp;


\*Relaxed means you **may** be able to get away with middle names/initials or entirely different names given you enter the correct membership number. Strict means that you have your name matching between the loyalty program and Asia Miles exactly. Otherwise your points/miles may go missing for up to a month.




*Protip: Have all your programs match your passport. Asia Miles will not issue you your ticket unless it matches. If they have to make a change, they will ask for you to send in a picture of your passport. And IME, that may delay your booking for another week*


&nbsp;


**Booking your flight**

&nbsp;

For all partners except for the ones listed below, which can be booked on their website, will require you to call in (unfortunately for you):

* Cathay Pacific


* Dragonair


* British Airways


* Qantas Airways


* Qatar Airways


* Finnair

&nbsp;

Also, if you are trying to do open jaw or stopovers in your flight you will also have to call since their website doesn't allow input for this type of itinerary. 


If you’re in the United States the number to call is 1-866-892-2598 and press 1,1,enter your membership id and #, 0, then 1 or 2(1-yes to customer survey, 2-no). 


The best time to call is after 9pm PST or before 8am PST. It is a 24-hour service line, but if you call outside of my recommended times, prepare to be on hold for up to 3 hours as well as facing random disconnects after an hour or so or a voicemail. 


Surprise, they never listen to their voicemail and they most definitely won’t return your call if you leave your number.


Guide them to the flight you want and hopefully they can see the availability you do. Ask them to reserve the seat. On every partner I called in about, I was able to reserve seats for at least 2-4 days. This may not be true with every partner. This is when you reserve the seat then transfer your points over. 


Of course this is never a guarantee that your seats will not all of a sudden disappear. But I haven’t seen any data points with any carrier where someone reserves seats with a partner and then they lose the seat when they call to complete the booking, but of course, if you have any data points, please reply below. Also *make sure you have your ducks in a row on the transfers as far as name matching goes!*


&nbsp;


**Fees**

&nbsp;

Fees for OneWorld alliance partners will be similar to what you see on BA’s website.


For Cathay Pacific, you are likely looking at the following fees:


* Fees and taxes imposed by government, other authority, or by the operator of an airport are HKD50.00 or more, and additional carrier-imposed charges, surcharges or fees of HKD193.00 or more will apply. The actual required miles and government and airport taxes/fees plus all carrier-imposed surcharges for all passengers will be advised at the time of booking.


More data points needed.


&nbsp;


**Upgradability**


&nbsp;


You may upgrade your seat from economy to business class, given only that there is no premium economy available on that flight. Upgrades on most partners will cost 10,000 Asia Miles or $100 for them to re-issue your ticket. This does not apply to Cathay Pacific, British Airways, and DragonAir as their policy statement posted on the award chart link states upgrades available at no extra cost.

&nbsp;

**Refunds**

If you would like to cancel a booking and get your miles refunded back, you may do so. But it will cost you $120/ticket. (HT: /u/highlander311)

&nbsp;

If anyone has any input or data points, please post it! Especially for the sections that state ‘more data points needed.’ I will edit and add to post.


Thanks!

I’m looking for some advice on my first vacation using mostly points. Been doing a lot of reading and research over the past 4 months and now I just need some guidance on how to book.

I can fly out of TUS or PHX and my goal is to take myself and my SO to Barcelona, Spain (BCN) -> Rome, Italy (FCO) -> Ibiza (IBZ) -> Barcelona, Spain (BCN).

Dates are flexible between March 8th - March 20th, 2016. Looking to travel between 7-10 days.

This is what I currently have: 66k MR, 94k UR and 48k Arrival+ Miles.

I’m understanding that the least points needed to get to BCN is 60k for a round trip flight via United per person. So I would need 26k more UR. Is there anyway that I can use my MR points for two one way flights to BCN and use my UR for the two returning flights? 

For short flights between BCN, FCO and IBZ I’m noticing a lot of inexpensive flights with not so friendly airlines (Ryanair). Would that be the best route to take for those flights?

I’m also in the process in researching the best cards for hotel says for this vacation as well. I’m mostly concerned about the flights right now.

Any other information that would help me would be amazing! Thank you"
80,Lots of J seats between US and New Zealand in July -- bookable with 97K MR/TYP RT,43,bsr4t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bsr4t6/lots_of_j_seats_between_us_and_new_zealand_in/,25,2019-05-25 09:41:24,"Premium award flights to New Zealand/Australia from the US are well known to be some of the hardest awards to snatch, with Air NZ flights being some of the rarer even among that set. We also recently got a guide written up which may have sparked some additional interest. 


I searched United for Air New Zealand space for a trip I'm making and was very surprised by the liberal availability. Currently NZ has J space open on **16** days in July for **LAX-AKL**, **10** days for **IAH-AKL**, and **7** days for **SFO-AKL**. 

In the reverse direction, availability is even more abundant. AKL-LAX and AKL-SFO both have **20(!)** days. **AKL-IAH** has **16** days. Some of these are double counting: AKL - SFO might be AKL-LAX-SFO. 

There are also some seats in May/June/August, but they are much more sparsely available compared to July. 

Air New Zealand is a partner of everyone's favorite airline of the day, Virgin Atlantic. A round trip J US-NZ ticket on them is 125K VS miles, and unlike ANA you can go one way for 62.5K. With the existing 30% transfer bonuses for TYP and MR, it's 97K points transferred to Virgin Atlantic to book a round trip. Given how hard this route is to book, it's a fantastic deal, even if Air New Zealand J is not the highest quality J product. 

Like ANA you can only book single segments, connecting flights are charged separately."
81,Award ticket cancelled (IRROPS etc)!! What to do! FAQ,49,cmlp7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cmlp7p/award_ticket_cancelled_irrops_etc_what_to_do_faq/,27,2019-08-06 08:03:52,"""Help!!! My ticket is canceled!""

""United changed their schedule and made the connection impossible!!!""

""United cancelled IAH-SYD for my date....."" etc. 

So you booked an award ticket in first class, and of course something goes wrong. What can you do? 

This is the guide to what you can do in this situation. Feel free to inform me if any part of the guide is wrong, and leave comments about your rebooking experiences.

====================================

The situations are mostly categorized as:

- Whether the ticket is sold by a US carrier (United, AA, Delta), or Asian carrier (ANA, EVA, etc); I never bought an award ticket through European carriers, so can't comment on that

- Whether the airline that sold you the ticket flies the route, eg. both ANA and United flies SFO-NRT

For simplicity, I would call the airline that sold you the ticket ""ticketing carrier"" TC, and the metal ""operating carrier"" OC

Basic knowledge:

Q: Flight cancelled! Who do I call?

A: TC. They sold you the ticket. OC will most likely not willing to modify the ticket, and can only takeover the ticket T-24h to departure.

==================================
Scenarios

a. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through US carriers

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

b. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through Asian carriers

- They will do the same and rebook you to your desired route on their own metal. This is true for the recent EVA strike.

c. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC flies the route

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

d. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC flies the route

- Varies.

- ANA: They WILL NOT open up their own space. Eg. SFO-TPE Eva air ticket through ANA. ANA can fly SFO-NRT-TPE, but THEY WILL NOT rebook you on their own metal. If no award ticket exists, they will CANCEL your ticket, and issue a refund. You can try to do a three way call (you, TC, OC), but most likely won't get you too far.

- Singapore airlines: They will rebook onto their own metal. 

- Need data points for other Asian carriers. 

e. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- You are probably out of luck. TC can't open up it's own space since they don't fly there, and they can't force OC to open up award space. You can try a three way call but you won't get too far. If TC flies to a nearby airport or award space exists for a nearby airport (eg. United flies to EWR, and original ticket was JFK), they should be willing to change your destination.

f. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- Worst case scenario. You can do a three way call, but most likely the ticket will just be cancelled. 


This is what I have experienced, and read stories on. Please feel free to correct me and share your experiences.

Lastly, when a ticket is cancelled, please be rational. If you book an intra-China ticket on Air China through United and the ticket is cancelled, don't expect United to force Air China to open a ticket; the ticket will most likely be cancelled."

We live in Austin, and, while we could theoretically drive to SA or Houston to fly out, we have pets that need to be boarded, and my husband will need to come back on his own (see below for more info), so we both need easy access to home on our return.

We are looking to go to Thailand early May of this year. We would fly there together, but then my husband will come back on his own to Austin (limited vacation time), and I will fly to Hong Kong to meet a friend for a few days before returning home. We would prefer economy flights, unless there is a really good deal on a higher class cabin (but we would never pay cash for that, so are not necessarily looking to just splurge).

I've looked at prices on Google flights to start getting an idea of airlines that go where we need them to go, and it seems that there are nearly no 1-stop flights from Austin to Bangkok, and many of the flights offered on there are mixed airlines (i.e. not in the same alliance). We want to use points for the entire trip, and I would love to have him fly back from Thailand to somewhere state-side direct (although I'm actually surprised that there might not be any--I thought for sure BKK>LAX would exist but it doesn't!), but if that's not possible, he is an anxious traveler, so connecting him through one very user-friendly for English speakers airport would be fantastic. I am thinking that we will need to book 2 one-way flights, so that we can ensure we are on the same booking number on the way out, but on the way back, I will need to book separate flights.

This is all very complicated to me! Any insights or suggestions?

EDIT: I found an AUS>LAX>SIN>BKK flight on United for 40K, with the SIN>BKK segment being on Singapore Airlines (which I would love to experience, even if it's just cattle class)! I think I will go ahead and book that, which based on the comments so far seems like par for what I should expect to spend on the flight and a decently good flight itinerary. If anyone also has any great hotel UR redemptions for while we are in Thailand, that would also be appreciated! Thanks so far everyone!"

We would be leaving from Washington, DC, and most likely starting and ending in Tokyo. We haven't figured out a complete itinerary, but I'm thinking 1.5 weeks, and we would hit up Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo.

We currently have the following miles/points:

- 300K Ultimate Rewards points

- 50K Membership Rewards points

- 250K American Airlines miles

- 68K United miles

- 36K SPG points

We would like to travel business class both ways. Ideally, I would like to book with United one way because I am going to cancel my MPE card when the AF hits, and I want to use all of the points while I still have the increased award availability. We can transfer UR points to United, so we could transfer exactly enough needed for two one ways in business and zero my United account out.

Was thinking AA for the other way, as AA miles are much easier to accumulate than UR points (we are both over 5/24).

Am I thinking through this correctly? Want to make sure we get the best use of our points on the best airline."

I have 600,000 UR points but can't find a way to use them. I go every year to the UK in the spring and I'm finding that my points/miles are becoming more and more useless to get where I want to go.

I'm looking at going from JFK to Manchester on June 8. There's a great cash fare of ~$250 nonstop on Thomas Cook Airlines (Condor subsidiary), baggage included. But I can't book it with my CSR at 1.5cpp- the airline doesn't show up on the UR Travel Portal, and the agents on the phone can't book it. Annoying.

I'm going to be staying at a Premier Inn in Manchester close to my grandparents. Premier Inn is one of the largest mid-range UK chain hotels, like a Holiday Inn. Great prices, about ~$240 for a 4 night stay. But again, the Premier Inn doesn't show up on the UR Travel Portal (they don't seem to show up on any OTAs like hotels.com or expedia.com). So I can't seem to use my UR for that either.

I'm going to be coming back to NYC via London, and there's a great nonstop fare of ~$250 from London to NYC on Primera Air, including baggage. But, AGAIN, Primera Air can't booked from the UR Travel Portal and the phone agents can't locate the flight either.

In sum, I have 600k UR points but I can't seem to find a way to make good use of them. If I transferred UR to Avios, I'd be hit with massive fuel surcharges and taxes flying BA or Virgin Atlantic to/from Manchester or London. And even something like United, with no fuel charges, if there's even award availability- why should I transfer 30k UR to United when I can get cash fares for $250 each way?

I've done a lot of research, so I'm not sure if anyone is able to help me here. This may just be a rant post. I know that mileage redemptions aren't great in economy (particularly to Europe) with cash fares so low- that's when people recommend booking low cash fares via the UR Travel Portal with 1.5cpp. But when those cash fares aren't available on the UR Travel Portal, what am I supposed to do? If the only fares that are bookable at 1.5cpp via the portal are expensive legacy carriers (like United and Virgin Atlantic want $1,000-$1,500 for the same flights), then 1.5cpp is a bunch of garbage IMO, because I'm not going to spend those prices."

Trip 1. This summer to Europe from PHL (ideally) although any NYC airport is doable. Been looking at Nice and Amalfi Coast August 3-August 12 roughly. Considering burning AA for this but from everything I'm reading it seems like AA business class isn't a great product so maybe I'd be better served flying on a Star Alliance airline?

Trip 2. Honeymoon next summer to Hawaii and Japan. Could I pull this off on ANA? I keep reading that ANA has to be RT which wouldn't work if we flew into Tokyo from US and then back from Hawaii. If this is doable on ANA then maybe I burn AA to Europe and save United miles for the honeymoon. If I should be looking at Cathay for the Japan trip then maybe I should be saving my AA and burning different points to Europe. Is finding biz to Japan on any airline in late June 2019 going to be a needle in a haystack?

In terms of points, I have 600K AA, 200K United assuming I can combine with my SO, 600K UR, 435K MR. If there's some great redemption I'm missing here for either of these trips and I should be digging into some of the UR/MR, I'm all ears. I would like to start burning some of these AA points one way or another though.

Alright, I think that covers it...sorry for the long rambling complicated post. TIA for any and all help

EDIT: Alright I put a ""Hold"" for 2 passengers on:


Outbound -

PHL-LHR-AMS J (115K AA + $51 fees) August 3, but with a daylong layover in London, so I get into AMS at 9:40 August 5

Returning -

ZRH-PHL Y (60K + $106) August 13, this is direct

87,United Miles flight from DPS -> JFK through Singapore Airlines - Immediate rejection from SA,7,9lf776,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9lf776/united_miles_flight_from_dps_jfk_through/,22,2018-10-04 23:44:24,"Need advice or if anyone can share their experience:

\-Saw on United site for flights from Bali (DPS) to JFK in Aug 2019 operated by Singapore Airlines, that's when I transfered my UR points to MP

\-Place booking on the United site but didn't receive an e-ticket to confirm

\-Called United and they informed me that when they tried pushing through that flight for approval, Singapore Airlines immediately rejected it

&#x200B;

Really annoyed at the fact since that same flight is available for the same KrisFlyer miles but I already converted my UR points. Any insight as to why Singapore Airlines will reject a United request? Not really sure how to approach this trip now that this flight was the only one I can really fly in."

[Here is my plan](https://i.imgur.com/fGRrUZE.png) which includes stopovers, airlines, and planes. Everything shows as available via United.com. I haven't flown anything except for coach before and neither has the friend I'm going with, so this is all extremely exciting. Am I making any obvious mistakes with the airlines/planes?

Any advice would be appreciated! We really want to spend time in Bangkok and Tokyo but besides that the itinerary is pretty random and subject to change based on suggestions. We like both big cities and cultural experiences as well as chilling on a beach getting drunk. Dates are flexible and the less time off of work the better, but up to 3.5 weeks is manageable.

The talks, which are at a preliminary stage, would see Emirates acquire the main airline business of Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, which would keep its maintenance arm, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. The negotiations could yet fall through, they said.

Both airlines initially declined to comment, before later denying that any talks were underway. Were a transaction to go ahead the enlarged airline operation would be bigger than that of [American Airlines Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAL:US), which has a market value of $19.2 billion.

Any deal would require the blessing of the rulers of the richest sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates. For Abu Dhabi, which sits on 6 percent of global oil reserves, it would advance a drive to overhaul state-controlled entities as it adapts to lower crude prices. The airlines have traditionally been arch rivals, with their hubs competing to attract the same transfer passengers making long-distance trips between Asia and the West.""

I've always used my UR points with airline transfer partners (United, Virgin, etc). Already booked F class flights to Japan through Virgin and I still have 200k UR points. Wanted to get peoples opinion of using points for Hotels. I saw that I can spend 17k UR points per night for a Hyatt Regency in Tokyo. I have always paid for my hotel lodging. I don't really have any status with anyone hotel chain other than SPG/Marriott that I got from Amex Platinum.

Wondering if it is worth transferring my UR to World of Hyatt points or better to just hoard my points for my next trip and use for either F/J class seats. I tend to do 2 international trips a year.

Thanks"

From what I can gather, each point is worth 1.4 cents currently. I am trying to book a flight now using the points on United's site and the ticket in question is either $290ish round trip, or 12.5k ""miles"" each way + $15. That would translate to about $365 if I convert 25k points to their value in cents and add the additional fee. Am i looking at this completely wrong?

93,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Amex MRs,33,49tbmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/,22,2016-03-10 16:00:58,"I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I'm going to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex’s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The “high season” is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 “high season” will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The “low season” is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “low season” and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “high season”. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “low season” and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “high season”.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions – Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic’s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al’s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al’s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (“WS”) is January 1 – March 24 and November 1 – December 31, while the Summer Season (“SS”) is March 25 – October 31.  El Al’s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan – from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!"
94,[award advice] MLE -> JFK Honeymoon Return Flight,6,6a4mzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6a4mzm/award_advice_mle_jfk_honeymoon_return_flight/,21,2017-05-09 14:46:19,"I had been tracking a return trip on Turkish Airlines business class through United, waiting for my points to post at the end of my Chase statement. This morning, the first leg of the trip (8h40m) is no longer available in business, and I'd have to split my trip between economy and business. There are no other all-business flights going out that day (+/- 1 day).

It's a honeymoon return flight, so it's pretty far in advance (3/9/18). Need two tickets (goes without saying -- easy to find one seat).

Any chance additional award space will open on a flight out of MLE if I wait it out, or should I bite the bullet and go for the econ/bus return flight that's available? My understanding is Turkish has a pretty good economy product, though ~9hrs is tough.

For reference, I'm booking purely UR flights. United is 80k pp business, and Turkish is Star Alliance partner.

At end of statement (~5/15/17), I will have 195k UR (right now have 145k)."
95,Overall strategy for business traveler?,6,bnhwab,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bnhwab/overall_strategy_for_business_traveler/,24,2019-05-12 02:30:01,"I’m looking for some advice. I’ve been a regular business traveler for a number of years and I’ve mostly just stuck to one airline and its partners, accrued miles, and has one card to earn extra points. Learning more about serious award travel experts, it seems like I might not be optimizing my point accumulation but I’m not totally sure how to do better. 

I see lots of people racking up lots of different points via cards and then transferring as needed, but it seems that for me such a strategy would mean missing out on all the points I earn through flying. But sticking to one FF program means less accrual and less than ideal redemptions. 

Are there tools or calculators or guides for figuring all this out?

Specifically, I typically fly 3-4 paid J international trips each year and another 4-5 domestic Y transcons. So on United that roughly gets me maybe 250k miles per year (maybe a bit more depending on fares). I also have a Chase Sapphire Preferred card so I get some points there but not as much as I get from flying. Typically I just end up moving my chase points into the united account to top up when I don’t have enough points for a redemption. But I suspect that isn’t ideal. On the other hand, I’m not sure it is really worth going after lots of various points given how much I’m tied to United via flying. 

So what do folks here do? What’s the right strategy for someone like me? What are the questions I should be asking?"

For some reason flyer talk has pages and pages of people saying this isn’t possible as recently as December.  Very easy process.

Apparently Swiss can’t give you an assigned seat if it’s a code share. I thought code share meant a booking on Swiss Air through a partner. It actually means one booking using 2 airlines for different defendants. Probably well known around these parts but I just sorted it out. Thanks guys. 

I was about to book a United award flight which would use either Swiss Air or Lufthansa back from Europe. I was just reading that those airlines won't let partner award travelers select seats beforehand. You apparently cant even pay the extra fee they normally charge paid ticketed passengers if you wanted to. They say you'll get your seat assignments at the gate.

Well how does this actually work out? We're a group of 4 and will be traveling with a child. I'm sure each airline is different, but in general do they just screw you over and stick everyone apart? Do they try and work everyone in? Do they at least keep a parent and child together? "

102,Advice needed on mileage use for first business class trip,13,bko0je,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bko0je/advice_needed_on_mileage_use_for_first_business/,21,2019-05-04 22:15:07,"Hello,

I am hoping to get some guidance on how best to use mileage to book a mixed class fare in 2020 and get the best value. I decided it would be nice to book a business class fare for the first time ever because I never sleep on flights and thought a lie-flat seat could finally allow me to sleep. So here’s where I’m hoping to get some expert advice on how to get the most out of this. Here’s my situation:

*I’ve got 70k Chase Rewards, and 15k United
*I will likely accumulate 30k more Chase miles over the next year
*So I would likely eventually only have enough miles to do business class there and then would need do economy back
*Direct flights a plus, and would be flying out of Chicago
*Only looking at travel to Europe or Asia

I’ve done a lot of research, but still don’t feel very informed about best business class product in Europe or Asia. I know Middle Eastern airlines have a great product, but I do not have a desire to travel to those destinations. So this is where I’m having an issue making a decision about how to best use miles. It seems United or ANA may be a good way to do a business class fare to Japan and then economy back. With the excursionist perk flight, that’d be 115k for business there and economy back. Is there a better option for travel to Asia?  

How about European business travel? United business class seems to get mixed reviews. Swiss appears to have good marks, but don’t know if I would be better off with a different airline. Any other stand outs?

To be honest, I want to maximize my choice, but even with the research I’m doing, I don’t feel like I have a grasp of the best avenue forward. So what I’m basically asking is as follows:  if I will eventually have 100k Chase Rewards and 15k United miles, what’s the best spend to get a business class there and then economy back in Europe or Asia?  It seems like staying with Star Alliance is a good idea, but I’m sure I’m not considering other ideas. Any guidance I could get would be most helpful. Thanks!"

Now I'm kinda thinking I should just ditch this card and get a Southwest card since we do a ton of US travel and San Diego is a huge hub of theirs, or a Costco AMEX since I've heard great things about them, or I don't know - some other card I don't know about.

106,ANA RTW Planning: Back Tracking in Asia Zones,18,abih1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/abih1z/ana_rtw_planning_back_tracking_in_asia_zones/,21,2019-01-01 17:16:29,"Hi everyone! Happy New Years! I first would like to say I am fairly new to Reddit community so please bear with me...

I am graduating from college in March 2020 and am planning to leave for RTW trip with my girlfriend, who is likely to be engaged to me by then. I have been in this game for about two years and I have read many RTW reports previously. I am hoping to finish booking RTW by April..

&#x200B;

The routes I am planning are as following:

1. SFO - NRT (ANA)
2. NRT - BKK (Thai;ANA)
3. BKK - TPE (Thai;EVA)
4. TPE - ICN(Thai;EVA;OZ)
5. ICN - IST (OZ)
6. IST - BCN(Turkish)
7. BCN - FRA (LH)
8. FRA - ORD/EWR (UA;??)

As far as my planning goes, the total distance is less than 22,000 miles, which should cost MR 125K per person. The tax and other fees I estimated through IATA came out to be around $700-- doable, but would be great if I could cut else where.

&#x200B;

The issue I am concerned here is backtracking. ANA distinguishes Zone 1: Japan, Zone 2: Korea, Zone 3: Taiwan, Zone 4: Thailand, Zone 6: United States, and Zone 7: Europe. Thus, my routing goes zone 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7. I have seen few data points where the backtracking in a certain region (e.x. Asia, Europe) was allowed. While ANA does not have an official rule for backtracking for RTW, it does have a rule for award redemption for based zones: [https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/tk/zone.html](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/tk/zone.html)

&#x200B;

So I was hoping to see more data points if anyone had an experience or issue in regards to this. I also wanted to hear some suggestion for the last leg (Europe - USA) since I was barely able to find saver availability on UA. If you know any good airline with least fuel surcharge, please share it with me!

Again, I apologize in advance. This is my first post on Reddit. Happy New Years everyone!

United just called me and it's less than 1 week away from my vacation travels for this flight... very short notice. Part of my flight is going from Naples (Italy) to Nevsehir (Turkey) about a week and a half into my vacation and now one of their partnered airlines (Turkish Airlines) is (I think) cancelling their flight from IST to NAV and the next best flight to Nevsehir (NAV) is 2 days later than my planned trip. I used my miles for this flight and so United is calling me what I want to do.

I have booked all my hotels and tours and did a lot of planning but now our plans require us to re-book everything and at a much more expensive last minute rate. Is there something I can do here? Like some way United can compensate for this kind of inconvenience?

Thanks in advance!

&#x200B;

Edit: Jeez this was such a time waster and mentally exhausting process... spent over 2 hours on the phone with 3 different customer rep, 1 dropped call, 2 transfers, and finally got to a supervisor that ended up resolving my crisis.  This was an eye opener for me, turns out with flights like these that are booked through United Rewards but flight is operated by another airline, United Airlines doesn't have much power.  I went with the NAP -> ASR route since that seemed the least impact to my schedule change. The supervisor called Turkish Airlines and needed Turkish Airlines to convert those economy seat into a mileage rewards seats or else United cannot use it but Turkish Airlines wouldn't budge even though it was their fault for a schedule change AND they had economy seats open for the NAP -> ASR. She tried a few other options and airports but it was either not available at all for miles or it was a huge change in schedule. The only option I was left with was to do business class upgrade for NAP -> ASR for 10k miles, I had to transfer my Chase points. I pressured the supervisor a bit more and was able to get a $100 voucher. All in all, I still need to make some changes due to change in airports but at least my schedule did not get impacted but it also costed me an extra 10,000 miles."

This got me thinking about a possible solution.

I have enough UR points to book 2 one way business class tickets via United (about 90K points each) and reading  United's site I can get these points re-deposited if I cancel less than 60 days from the departure for a $125 free for each ticket. 

Does this sound like a good game plan? 

Also, United has this rule ""Fee for booking a MileagePlus award ticket through any channel, less than 21 days before departure"" That fee is $75 for ticket. 

Right now, I'm just super frustrated I have these Alaska Miles and can't find good award availability with Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines. "

111,Live in DC... United or Southwest?,1,c49ocx,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c49ocx/live_in_dc_united_or_southwest/,20,2019-06-23 22:59:42,"Hi everyone,

I live in mount vernon triangle area in DC and travel domestically for work.  I currently fly United and most of the time have to travel to Dulles. I started with United because Marriott gave me silver status and knew they occasionally fly out of DCA and have the United Hub in Dulles. 

I don’t mind taking an Uber to Dulles and or BWI if flights are direct and prefer that to connecting flights out of dca. I would love to find an airline that flys out of DCA more that isn’t American since my experiences with them are usually poor there. 

I have flown ~30,000 miles this year and am on track to hit United Gold. I wasn’t sure if this is worth much flying out of a hub like Dulles where it seems everyone is 1k / Platinum. 

I have a girlfriend who would benefit from the companion pass in Southwest if I could hit that and haven’t opened any of the credit cards with them either. 

So my main question is should I keep flying with United or do people living in DC prefer Southwest?"

We're flying economy and do not have any sort of special airline statuses. I do have the Bank of America Premium Rewards card which has a $100 credit for airline incidentals but wasn't sure if that would credit the the ANA Lounge fee. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

My partner and i are looking to go  NYC to Thailand/Singapore/Bali Mid December 2018.    

have about 600k points Chase Ultimate rewards and 'think' that Singapore airlines, Korean, ANA (Via Virgin Atlantic), and United Polaris are our options for flights in business (or first) class.

&#x200B;

Not looking to spend more than 90k per person in points per leg of flight.

I'd like to utilize openjaw - stopover options if possible.    

Singapore airilines recently announced a flight from EWR to singapore direct that has us interested but I tried signing up for Krisflyers and i think there is a delay before I can search award availability.  

&#x200B;

  


  
The main goal is to spend time in Bali but def interested in seeing Singapore, Thailand, Maldives (if reasonable) within about 2-3 weeks beginning around December 18th and going through the new year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

any help/direction would be great.

115,Will United status match if I was given American Airlines status as a promo offer?,15,ccr1qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/ccr1qp/will_united_status_match_if_i_was_given_american/,25,2019-07-13 20:11:47,"About a month ago, I got an e-mail from AA saying they were offering me free gold status through the end of September. They offered a lower threshold of EQM/EQD to retain gold through 2021 as well. However, I don't usually fly or have many miles on AA. I take them out of convenience sometimes for work (since I live near DCA) but I've tended to accrue and fly more on United over the years. However, I'm not ~ quite ~ a frequent flyer enough on United to hit silver. I have almost triple the number of miles on United than American and I tend to care more about mile accrual to use one day for a trip (have about 30K now) than upgrades, priority stuff, etc. 


I read on United's website they will status match with AA Gold to United Silver. Will United match my current American gold status even though it is was given as part of a promotion?


I think I could potentially hit silver on United regardless of the status match, but it would require flying a bit more out of my way on a few trips and I haven't confirmed enough trips for the rest of the year to where I would definitely hit silver, so trying for a status match would make life easier. I know with the status match, for silver, you do have to hit a certain amount of miles with United within 90 days (I think 8 EQD or 8,000 EQM) which is not a problem as I have four confirmed work trips in the next three months, two of which are east coast to west coast and one international so that is certainly attainable. Thanks!"
116,Honeymoon flights finally booked - IAH-DPS (BALI) JAN 2020,20,bbhszg,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bbhszg/honeymoon_flights_finally_booked_iahdps_bali_jan/,23,2019-04-10 08:26:10,"After a few days of pain, I finally finished all my award books for my honeymoon flights next Jan 2020.

&#x200B;

Here is what I got.

IAH-SIN-DPS for 99k Krisflyer miles each on Singapore Air business class - transferred from UR

DPS-SIN 7.5k krisflyer miles each on Singapore Air Economy (stopover in SIN for two days to stay at Marina Bay Sands hotel)

SIN-BKK-TPE-YVR 90 United miles each 2 Thai Airways business class, then EVA Air business class from TPE-YVRYVR-IAH 12.5k Krisflyer miles each on Air Canada and United

&#x200B;

A total of 209k miles each.

&#x200B;

My original plan for these flights was to use the excursionist perk to book IAH-DPS stopover in SIN then fly back to IAH for 180k round trip, but things didn't work out as planned.

&#x200B;

Issue 1 -  Not being able to book Singapore air award flights on United - this happened in January of this year and is an ongoing issue today. This killed my plans b/c a direct flight from DPS-SIN via Singapore air should be 2hr 40min, but the only available way now is through BKK and a 19hr flightThis caused me to transfer my UR points to Kris Flyer and book the first leg of the trip via Singapore airlines.

&#x200B;

Issue 2 - Fiancee signed up for the United Explorer business card and received a 75k bonus on United. So we were basically forced to use them to book our return flight. I had many issues finding a business saver ticket on United (90k points each). I eventually found a flight with Eva through TPE and booked it but it wouldn't go through. After many hrs on the phone, it turns out United's website for award booking is not very accurate and there were no award bookings left for the flight I booked.

&#x200B;

This happened 3 other times - I call United, confirm availability on business class for 2 people on my days (gave a 3-day window), book online and the bookings kept on being unconfirmed. There was literally no available flights from SIN (or BKK or TPE) back to IAH with a Business Saver Award. I thought I was doomed since I now had 180k points stuck on United.

&#x200B;

Luckily I found a flight SIN-BKK-TPE-YVR (Vancouver) that was all business class flights and it actually went through (I was shocked). I had to spend an additional 12.5k per person to get from YVR-IAH the next day but I said fck it and was just relieved we can actually go on this trip now.

&#x200B;

Lesson learned - Always call and confirm award availability (esp for Business class) via partner airlines (call the actual partner airline and the airline you are booking through).

&#x200B;

Now the fun part - booking hotels and planning our trip - we will spend 8 full days in Bali, 2 full days in Singapore, 1 day in Vancouver, and about 2.5 days in transit."
117,Cancelling return flight on ANA award,1,bu4uip,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bu4uip/cancelling_return_flight_on_ana_award/,17,2019-05-29 00:09:21,"I've hit a bit of a snag planning my wife & I's trip to Asia at the end of Summer. There is ONE leg left that I'm having trouble booking (more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bkzi9e/how_frequently_do_airlines_add_more_award/?ref=share&ref_source=link) if you're curious) where my wife has been able to book the leg we need (SIN-NRT) via United partner award but unfortunately the only J availability for the direct flight I can find is only available through ANA. 

This really isn't much of a problem as the 60k points required translates to a 4 cent/point redemption...but ANA only accepts round trip award bookings. I currently have enough Amex points to transfer over and book.

My question is, has anyone ever booked ANA for a round trip award and skipped the return? Are there any charges for cancelling the return? Is there any possibility I could have points refunded for cancelling the second flight?"
118,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Citi TYPs,31,49tcba,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tcba/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_citi_typs/,19,2016-03-10 16:07:03,"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/) and my [post on getting to Europe using Chase URs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbx6/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_chase_urs/), I tried to do this overview including MRs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Citi TYPs***

Citi offers a few cards that earn ThankYou Points, including their ThankYou Premier card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for travel and gas). Citi offers a few other card options that earn TYPs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Citi’s website and check out the options.

Your TYPs will transfer to 12 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your TYPs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since Cathay Pacific operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be lower than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. FlyingBlue is definitely going to be your best option for a SkyTeam partner redemption and is a good choice in general for a coach redemption – though unless you are dead set on flying a SkyTeam partner airline, it is not going to be your best bet for a premium cabin redemption. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Garuda Indonesia**

Garuda Indonesia’s GarudaMiles program uses a distance based award chart, so your redemption cost will depend on your home airport. Garuda Indonesia is part of the SkyTeam alliance which means you can redeem your GarudaMiles for Air France, KLM, Alitalia, Delta, Czech Airlines or Garuda Indonesia (on their 5th freedom route from Amsterdam (AMS) to London (LGW)) flights.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~75k miles for coach and ~135k miles for business class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~85k miles for coach and ~150k miles for business class.

Although the redemption rates may not be horrible, the process for obtaining your award ticket is probably the worst I have ever seen. First you need to call the Garuda Indonesia call center at 021.2351.9999 to place your award ticket on hold. Then you need to download and complete an award ticket application form which you must take to a Garuda Indonesia sales office, in person, and then go back to the ticket office, in person, to claim your award ticket. So how many sales offices does Garuda Indonesia have in the US? Four. Yes, you read that right. Four. Encino, California, Chicago, Houston and New York.

In short, avoid Garuda Indonesia like the plague for award tickets unless you happen to live in or very near Encino, Chicago, Houston or New York and do not mind doing a ton of legwork.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your TYPs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Malaysia Airlines**

Malaysia Airlines’ Enrich program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Malaysia Airlines is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Enrich miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~54k miles roundtrip for coach, ~96k miles roundtrip for business class and ~132k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~72k miles roundtrip for coach, ~132k miles roundtrip for business class and ~192k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

While the redemption rates are actually generally not horrible, there have been a lot of reports of people experiencing issues when transferring their TYPs to the Enrich program. I would generally steer clear of transferring your TYPs to the Enrich program until Malaysia Airlines gets their IT department up to speed and fixes these issues.

**Qantas**

Qantas’ Frequent Flyer program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qantas is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe. Qantas also partners with Aer Lingus, so you can also fly them on a partner award ticket!

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~70k miles roundtrip for coach, 105k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~130k miles roundtrip for business class and ~190k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~84k miles roundtrip for coach, ~126k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~156k miles roundtrip for business class and ~228k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Remember that you will be charged for carrier imposed surcharges, which means avoid British Airways and Iberia flights for the trans-Atlantic segment if you can!

Qantas’ redemption costs are fairly high, so unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qantas miles that you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe as the Qantas redemptions rates are not very good.

**Qatar**

Qatar’s Qmiles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qatar is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~75k miles roundtrip for coach, ~112.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~150k miles roundtrip for business class and ~225k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip for coach, ~127.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~170k miles roundtrip for business class and ~255k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Again, and as with Qantas, unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qmiles you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe.

**EVA Air**

EVA Air is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Infinity miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 68k miles for coach, 105k miles for business class and 170k miles for first class.

EVA Air requires that you make your Star Alliance award ticket booking through their reservation office. With that said, considering that Singapore Airlines has access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that EVA Air has, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines for a coach or first class redemption. If you are looking for a business class award ticket, you are better off transferring your TYPs to EVA instead of Singapore Airlines.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Thai Airways**

Thai Airways is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Royal Orchid Plus miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 70k miles for coach, 125k miles for business class and 160k miles for first class.

Keep in mind that Thai Airways charges fuel surcharges as well on award tickets, and from all reports I have seen, they are exorbitant. Considering that Singapore Airlines and EVA should both have access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that Thai Airways has access to, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines or EVA (if you want a business class award ticket) for this redemption unless you have a huge stash of Royal Orchid Plus miles that you are looking to burn and you do not mind paying exorbitant surcharges.

**Etihad**

Although Etihad is not a part of any major airline alliance, they do have several strategic partnerships with airlines such as Air Berlin, Alitalia, Czech Airlines and Brussels Airlines. Unfortunately, you are not able to redeem your Guest Miles for award tickets on these airlines. Etihad’s Guest Miles program is a dynamic program that has so many variables in its pricing structure that I could not possibly address all the possibilities here. I would instead recommend that you go to their mileage calculator and plug in your information to determine your mileage redemption rates.

For reference though, most of your flights are going to run well over 100k miles for a coach award ticket, so I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere to transfer your TYPs for a European trip.

u/workthrowaway323 pointed out (thanks!) that you can actually book AA saver level award flights with your Guest Miles. Like AA, Etihad uses a peak/off peak system for economy award tickets. Off-peak dates between the U.S. and Europe are October 15 - May 15. Roundtrip economy redemptions will cost you 40k miles off-peak and 60k miles during peak times, while business class will cost 100k miles and first class will cost 125k miles. To redeem you have to contact the Etihad service center at 888-8ETIHAD ***at least 14 days prior to the intended date of travel***. 

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are quite good, it is important to remember that your TYPs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of TYPs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the second worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your TYPs!"

Within United, we can fly Fort Wayne, IN, US (FWA) to Rome, IT (FCO) for either 30K points in Econ or 70K points in Bus.  The Econ trip duration is 17 hours and the Bus flight duration is 19.5 hours.

Would you guys book the Bus or Econ flight?

I assume I can cancel and re-book (within United) if a better flight pops up the week we are leaving?  I.e. I'm planning on booking a crappy econ flight for the trip back now and hope to get a better route (less trip duration) closer to the trip date."

Hello all,

My wife and I are flying to South Korea to visit her parents and I booked 2 award tickets.

One on Korean Air going to Seoul and one on Asiana using UA miles going back to LAX.

As the subject says, I mistakenly put my wife's married name on the ticket for the return flight on Asiana but her passport is still in her maiden name.

I've called both United and Asiana and they keep telling me to call the other airlines but won't change the name on the ticket.

My question is, in your experience, was it difficult to have the agent at the ticket counter change the name to match the passport? Specifically at Incheon if anyone else has had this problem.

I've been reading that people bring their marriage certificate and ID or in my wife's case her green card, and they haven't had any issues getting the name changed when checking in.

I've talked to United and they've added a note to her ticket stating that the boarding pass should be changed to her maiden name as well but I'd rather have some piece of mind.

I was thinking about going to the airport early to check in and showing them all the appropriate documents and asking them to change it there and if worse comes to worse calling United to confirm that the name change has been requested and see if they'd listen to United.

I would cancel the ticket and rebook and change the name but there is no more availability left on the reward tickets and I don't want to risk cancelling and then not having it show up again.

Also, we wouldn't be able to change her name on the passport because our flight going to Korea is under her maiden name.

Thanks for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated."

&#x200B;

I did a little bit of research and decided to look for award flights to Athens.

&#x200B;

Since award flights out of IAH were not available, I decided to do some searches out of airports on the eastern side of the country. Using RR points, I will take a flight to the east coast from Houston.

&#x200B;

I do have a few questions for the more experienced individuals. Here are my searches, point costs, and questions:

&#x200B;

American Airlines

There is plenty of Business and First class availability for the date range we plan to go. 57,500 points each way via Business/First MilesAAver and 85,000 points each way via First MileSAAver.

* What is the difference between the two type of redemptions?
* Aircraft types are 744, 320, and 777 with American Airlines and British Airways. That being said, is there any preference in between the three aircraft types?
* To book, I would transfer my UR to British Avios, then call British Airways to book the flights using flight number and dates, correct? Would the point costs in ""British Avios"" be the same as the AA points I see on the AA website?
* Anything else I need to look for if booking thru AA?

&#x200B;

Alaska Airlines

* No availability, was hoping to find something with Emirates and fees with ""Partner Airlines"" were too high.

United

Some of availability, a few Business Saver Awards within the date ranges we are looking for (+/- 2 days, a little flexibility). Costs are 70,000 points each way.

* Availability are flights operated by Austrian, SWISS, and Aegan. Is there any preference or experiences within these two airlines?
* Sadly, no Lufthanasa availability.
* Any other airlines to look into within the United umbrella?
* Anything else I need to look for if booking thru United?

&#x200B;

Out of the options available, which would you pick and why?

Any other suggestions?

&#x200B;

Thank you!

124,[award advice] Planning ahead for Europe late 2017 with UR,8,57kil7,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/57kil7/award_advice_planning_ahead_for_europe_late_2017/,19,2016-10-15 08:16:11,"I'm trying to plan my honeymoon for late next year to Europe, and I wanted to run it by you guys to make sure I'm not overlooking anything in my research. 

* We will have around 300k UR to spend on this trip for 2 passengers.
* We are based out of LAX.
* Targeting Italy as the primary destination, possibly with a stopover in a 2nd nearby country.
* Targeting lie-flat J class seats at least to Europe, and ideally back as well.
* Aim to minimize surcharges, thus currently targeting transfer to United for *A bookings.
* Currently thinking ~2 week trip, with at least 1 week in Italy.
* Dates are flexible, but targeting late next year (perhaps October?) to try and optimize availability and aim for shoulder season, but still have plenty of daylight hours and nice weather.


Skypass would only cost 160k RT for J class, but I didn't see any fuel surcharges under $400 per person for any of the airlines with nice lie-flat seats. Since United doesn't pass on fuel surcharges, I'm currrently targeting them. However, searching for availability is an issue.


Let's assume that FCO is my destination. Since I don't believe Star Alliance has an airline that flies direct from LAX, I'm thinking of taking advantage of the fact that they *don't* fly direct and instead stopover in another country for several days. From my research, the following seem to be my options:


* Turkish Airlines, stopover in Istanbul. Not sure how safe it would be to spend time in Turkey.
* Austrian Airlines, stopover in Vienna.
* Lufthansa, stopover in Munich/Frankfurt.
* Swiss Air, stopover in Zurich.
* SAS, stopover in Stockholm. I've never seen availability for this.


Am I missing anything here? With the recent United routing changes, the number of unique routes seems to have shrunk, but it's possible I'm overlooking something. That being said, I'm currently thinking Austrian will be our best bet, since it seems to have good availability when I search as far out as possible (currently August and September 2017) and Vienna seems like a good place to visit. Austrian also seems to have a good J product from what I've read.


For the return trip, Turkish seems to have good availability, and we could do a short layover in IST to check out the Turkish business lounge which I've heard is great. Additionally Turkish seems to have a great J product.


A final thought is the realization that 2 RT J class flights to Europe will cost 280k UR via United, which won't leave many points left for any hotel bookings. I've read that Hyatt is the best redemption for UR, but it also doesn't seem like there's more than 1 or 2 Hyatt's per country, and usually they're high end ones at that (PH Milan, PH Vienna, etc.). Should I be trying to obtain more UR for transfers to Marriot? Opening a Marriot/SPG card for Marriot/SPG points? We are also considering paying cash for airbnbs.


Please let me know if I have overlooked anything. Additionally, any personal experiences flying these products are welcome...though it doesn't look like I have a lot of options beyond the ones I've mentioned in terms of minimizing fuel surcharges and actual award availability. Thank you in advance!"

Hoping to plan my trip for next Christmas using points, but I'm seeing pretty crappy deals and hoping one of you might give me some guidance. 


Here are the basics:

My partner and I both signed up for the Alaska MBNA card, so I have ~30k points and she has ~25k points. We're both going to be stocking up on Aeroplan points this year, and I've got about 100k worth in amex right now (ready for 1:1 transfer to aeroplan). We'll sign up for whatever cards we need to get us enough points to make the trip (assume that we'll have the points). We would prefer to fly business, but can also do economy.


We're hoping to fly to either EZE or SCL (Buenos Aires or Santiago, Chile) around December 14th (flexible) and return 3 weeks later from the opposite airport. We're also open to travelling out of Seattle if that makes things substantially easier.


Here's what I'm finding so far:

Alaska: all reward flights seem to have gone up to 57.5k, with none of the 30k flights available after Nov 12. Do they not offer anything in economy closer to xmas? It's a shame since Alaska charges next-to-nothing in taxes.


Aeroplan: typical, flights are available but taxes are insane. The routes I've found to and from each city are all AC flights and taxes range from $380pp/flight, leading to a total cost of $1600 in taxes. I can buy market rate for ~$2100, so it's a shit deal.


Any suggestions here, fine folks? I've read up on researching different legs on different airlines, but not sure which websites to use for this. I tried united, but didn't get anywhere.


Here are the options I've found so far: https://imgur.com/a/wAZX9

127,What useful award booking knowledge did you learn last year?,50,7no7a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7no7a0/what_useful_award_booking_knowledge_did_you_learn/,19,2018-01-02 21:19:12,"It is the start of a new year, hopefully everyone used all their miles and had awesome trips last year. I am listing a couple of useful tips that I have found helpful over the year. Please add something you have found helpful while booking award travel. 

1. If you can't find good flights out of your home city search from cities with international flights.  Often times programs like United show you different results based on your search city. Even if you fly out of LAX you might find a lot more availability out of Houston. Some programs like United don't allow you to ""customize"" your routing, but you can add an additional flight for the price of the flight. 

2. Look at the airline you want to fly route map. I have found J availability to Tokyo from San Jose when all the other cities ANA flies to had no availability. I found Christmas time LATAM J flights to Santiago from Orlando when there was not availability from any other city. 

3. When booking Southwest/refundable flights book them as one ways and check google flights 48-24h before your flight to see if cash fares on other airlines have decreased (I cancelled a $135 Southwest ticket for a $27 AA ticket today). Also periodically check to see of the Southwest fare has decreased. 

4. Be aware of phantom availability. Just because you see a flight as bookable online doesn't mean that the award space actually exists.
 
5. When searching for award availability be aware that all partners don't get the same award availability and use multiple sources. I was searching for Fiji availability and the easiest way to find it was with Alaska's search tool. I also used expert flyer which showed space that wasn't bookable on Alaska, but was bookable on American Airlines. 

6. Just because there are rules doesn't mean that they are always followed. I have found Singapore long haul 777er routes with partner availability, I have had AA change the arrival city of an award ticket for free, I have had AA cancel a paid ticket 48 hours after booking for free, I have been upgraded to club level access when it is specifically not allowed.

We will have around 700k MR, 275k UR and 450k AA (would ideally like to preserve our MR and eventually cash out via Schwab at 1.25, but not a huge deal)

Below is a list of different routes/airlines I was able to find. Again, if I have anything incorrect, or missed a possible route, please let me know!

&#x200B;

U.S. to Australia/NZ

Route: DFW-SYD

Book: Search award availability via Qantas and call AA to book

Airline: Qantas/80k AA in J One Way, 110k AA in F One Way/Nonstop

Availability: Looks like it’s not so bad (or is it tough?)

I’ve read that if there’s availability from ORD-DFW, I can ask American to add this to the ticket for no additional miles, is this correct?

Time: \~17hrs (not including connection from Chicago)

&#x200B;

Route: ORD-AUK

Book: via United

Airline: United/80k in J One Way/Non-Stop, in F/1 Connection in SFO

Availability: Seems non-existent

Time: \~19 hrs.

&#x200B;

U.S. to Asia- to Australia/NZ

Route: ORD-SYD

Book: via ANA

Notes: ANA/105k MR to 115k MR RT (have to book RT) in J / 210k MR in F (Tokyo to SYD)/ One quick connection in Tokyo

Availability: Seems to be a lot

Time: 25 Hrs.

If you went through VS, would it be 120k RT in First from ORDà Tokyo and then 70k to 80k Tokyo to SYD?

&#x200B;

Route: JFK-SIN-SYD

Book: via Singapore

Notes: Singapore Airlines/154k One way KrisFlyer in F/ 2 connections JFKàFRAàSIN—SYD. Potential of long layover in Singapore to explore city for a bit

Availability: Tough, but not impossible

Time: \~32 hours

&#x200B;

The next few routes, I’m not too sure of, so any input is appreciated!

&#x200B;

U.S.--Middle East-Australia/NZ

Route: ORD-DOH-SYD/AUK

Book: Search availability on Qantas, call AA. (When searching on Qantas, could not pull up Doha as origination city—any advice??)

Notes Qatar Airways/80k AA in J to DOH/ 70k in J (not sure if this is correct?) DOH to SYD or AUK/

Time: \~30 hrs (13 hrs ORD-DOH, DOH-AUK \~17hrs)

&#x200B;

Route: ORD-AUH-SYD

Ethiad/Apartments (is it 70k or 110k AA one way?) ORD-AUH, AUH-SYD (not sure how many AA miles?)

Notes: Book by searching on Ethiad and then calling in AA

&#x200B;

I’m not as familiar with Delta, VS or AF, so not sure if I’m missing any obvious routes from those partners?

Personally, I think the best route would be Qantas (any feedback on J v F?) and then ANA (takes a little longer through this route)

What are your experiences with Qantas F and J?

Is it as simple as finding availability on Qantas as far out as possible and then book via AA?

Did I miss an obvious route?

Have a 1-2 days of flexibility on departure and return if needed but would like to stick to those dates if possible.

Singapore Krisflyer 110,000 (Expires Jan 24, 2019)

Aeroplan 142,107

AA 87,565

BA Avios 53,701

Delta 105,346

United 6,145

**Departure Plan Apr 5 NYC-BKK:**

**Avail:** AA award for CX JFK-HKG-BKK Y

**Desired:** Upgrade to JAL(Preferred) or CX hoping for close-in avail to open up for 70k AA.

**Return Apr 16 BKK-NYC:**

**Avail:** Thai-Asiana BKK-ICN-JFK on Krisflyer 97.5k.

**Desired:**

*Option 1:* Again hope for close-in avails to open up on EVA BKK-TPE-JFK or ANA BKK-NRT/HND-JFK

*Option 2:* Thai / Lufthansa BKK-FRA-JFK for 112.5k in F (close-in avail)

* Debating option 2 as Thai/LH F experiences are really well-reviewed. But the extra 12.5k points is enough for a shorthaul NA worth about $100-200 and have to pay $300-400 in surcharges I think for LH... Is it worth it? I know it's subjective... CX/JAL I've flown in F and while it was cool, wouldn't normally spend more points to go F over J on those airlines.

**Thoughts/Questions**

* I'm trying to reduce the random buckets of points I have. I'm trying to use AA (as there's no other way for me to use those) and Krisflyer as it has the hard expiry. But would welcome suggestions if I really should be using something else.

* I'm really familiar with last-min avails on AA with CX/JAL and feel pretty good about finding something within 2 weeks. But I'm not familiar at all with last-min on the * Alliance - EVA/ANA/LH/Thai. Is it the same as CX/JAL? Am I likely to be able to find F avail on LH/Thai or barring that ANA/EVA on J getting closer to departure? How soon should I be looking? Ideally I'm not trying to search avails during the trip.

* If I did choose to go F, I'd normally book the ""better"" cabin experience at the departure, not the return but I'm reading a big part of the appeal of Thai F is the lounge/departure services so I've put that on the return end.

* Noting also that Songkran is Apr 13-15 so I don't know if returning Apr 16 is going to be tougher to find avails.

* I've travelled on CX/JAL but not the other airlines mentioned but appreciate any tips, thoughts on the itinerary, airlines I'm picking, or anything else would be appreciated!"

I see the airline partners with Chase and I'm bummed my favorite airline (Delta) is not on there but my least favorite (United) is. I'm not 100% against United but I really do not want to fly with them. Are there loopholes with the other transfer partners where you can transfer to them and book a codeshare ticket to Australia?

My main post ends here the paragraph below is just extra useless information in case any of you are interested.  


I don't like United because I flew them from FRA-IAH once and the flight was subpar as well as I took them from PHX-MSP and back via ORD and my butt started hurting an hour into the flight. And I love flying. I'm weird and I actually enjoy commercial air travel so most annoyances don't bother me so if I don't like an airline then it's got to be bad lol. Also I am willing to give United another shot because I haven't flown with them in 3 years so maybe they've improved?

137,My first award trip - book before 10/6,3,4zz6yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4zz6yq/my_first_award_trip_book_before_106/,18,2016-08-28 16:30:33,"Hello,

This is my first post so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong. (Edit: took me 10 min to get sub bullets to work haha)

I have the following points and trip ideas and could use some advice.

**Points:**

UR - 89k
United - 106k me (SO has 23k)
Delta - 25k

**Ideas:**
Both leaving from PHL, NYC, DC or other regional airports 

New Zealand + Australia (+ an island, Bora Bora etc)
China (Xi'an at least) + ??? (Europe, Japan, SE Asia)

**Constraints:**

- so any multi week trip has to be after June 17th 2017 (maybe the 13th if we bet on having no snow make up days tacked on)
- singe weeks are available: April 8-17, Feb 11-20 or Feb 17-26, Dec 23-jan 2, Nov 19-28. Could use two with a delayed stopover
- I want to maximise point value while taking advantage of the soon to be eliminated united rules.
- I will be getting more points in the future so will be doing both trips.
- I don't mind paying for a few legs in cash if that makes sense 
- my SO is getting over her fear of flying to i want to stay away from budget airlines and all but the best SE Asia airlines. Not sure about China airlines. Would like to fly direct to Xi'an with united.

**My thoughts on options:**

* New Zealand trip - 2+ weeks in June/July/August 
PHL-->AKL (stopover) --> SYD
SYD --> island?? (Stopover) --> PHL 
  * I know it's winter but 50's and 60's in AKL don't sound too bad. Colder at higher elevations. Thoughts?
  * 5-7 days in NZ, 3 days on the island and net in AUS?
  * as for the island I know french Polynesia is tough with united so I'd be willing to pay cash or use UR points some other way to get there from AKL or SYD.
  * any ideas on  using an open jaw to make this ttrip dea better?



* For  China trip - 2+ weeks in June/July/August 
PHL--> Japan/Thailand/Europe (stopover) --> Beijing 
Xi'an (open jaw) --> PHL (long stopover) --> anywhere? 
  * could reverse this trip
  * I have to be in Xi'an for 3-5 days to visit my SO's fam-jam but open after that
  * would take the high-speed train to or from Beijing 
  * stopover: want to max value here/do what makes sense given the rule change. As for Europe this may also help break up the long flight. Not sure of a Europe destination. Something that would be harder to hit on a future eurotrip.
  * as for the anywhere, open to ideas on places where one way returns are cheep or I could wait and use future points.



*  Last option is using the single weeks and delayed stopovers and maybe stand alone flights to split the trips up? I am kind of over my head on this one. Ideas?



Really appreciate the help!

Thank you"
138,Help requested: AS international award flight cancelled. What are my options?,9,dgt2aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/dgt2aw/help_requested_as_international_award_flight/,18,2019-10-12 13:48:38,"My Japan Airlines flight from NRT to BOS booked via Alaska Airlines has been cancelled due to the ongoing typhoon. The Japan Airlines phone lines are not working so I'm not able to find out whether they're able to rebook me. I called Alaska and the CSR said that only they can rebook me but the first available flight to Boston is next Friday.

Has anyone else had any experience getting an earlier flight out? I'm also willing to go to SFO but on the website the first available flight is Thursday.

**Posting an update for everyone:** I called AS again to see if they're able to rebook me on a flight to SFO instead of BOS. After escalating to a supervisor who worked on award flights, the supervisor said they are not able to change destinations for me but was willing to make a one time exception provided seats were available. He looked through all JL seats for all west coast cities and even DFW for the next few days and only DFW was available on the Friday.

I continued to check award space for the next hour and a HND>SFO flight opened up for Thursday. I called AS again and after some discussion she said she couldn't change my flight to a different destination without the change fee but was willing to drop the cancel fee and have me rebook that flight myself.

I then looked around other carriers and luckily find an ANA flight to SFO via United for 35k + $100 in taxes for Wednesday so I went for that."
139,ANA RTW last minute cancel and rebook success story,41,bt13ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bt13ig/ana_rtw_last_minute_cancel_and_rebook_success/,18,2019-05-26 03:27:47,"In case it interests anyone, I thought it would be useful to share a data point where I was narrowly able to cancel and rebook a RTW for my wife and I about 100 hours before departure. 19,500 miles around the world in J.

It's pretty well known at this point that ANA offers incredible value, especially with the elusive RTW award. What makes the RTW especially tricky is that ANA's rules require saver availability on all flights to be open at the same time when you book. This may be obvious, but it is worth stating. Of course you can have some legs in Y, but you're paying for J, and isn't that the point?

In December we booked the following itinerary from 5/30 to 6/16 for 2 in J:

5/30: ATL-YYZ-YUL (AC)

5/31: YUL-PEK-HKT (CA)

6/7: HKT-BKK (TG)

6/9: BKK-BRU (TG)

6/16: DUB-YYZ (AC)

To me, this itinerary was always good but not great. Our first flight left at 6 am and we didn't get to Thailand until midnight. We also had a tight connection in PEK and had almost 20 hours on Air China. First world problems, I know, but I've heard mixed reviews about Air China's seat and service and that transiting PEK could be a nightmare. That being the case, I booked in December with the intention of rebooking down the road if the planets aligned and space opened up for a different routing.

Since December, I've maxed out the 200 alerts on ExpertFlyer and have been vigilantly watching all manner of different routings that would take us RTW with somewhat inflexible dates. It's worth noting that ANA award flights must be booked no later than 96 hours ahead of departure, which meant today was our last day to change for a May 29 evening departure. 


Drumroll...................it happened!!


After 6 months of virtually nothing opening up (*maybe* one or two possible routings came up, but they would have required a good bit of compromise) today finally was the day when J availability opened up enough for us to change. So we did. We are now flying:


5/29: ATL-ORD (UA)

5/30: ORD-HND (NH)

5/31: HND-BKK (TG) - intentionally long layover in BKK to check out the city for a bit and take a break from flying


5/31: BKK-HKT (TG)

6/7: HKT-BKK (TG)

6/8: BKK-AMS (BR !!)

[open jaw]

6/16: LHR-EWR (UA 767 new polaris)

6/16 EWR-ATL (cash on DL)


Overall I'm pretty ecstatic and just wanted to share with everyone. The total mileage was 115k and $600 per person with MR transferred to ANA. Surcharges on the rerouting went up a good bit because of returning to North America via London, but it was a tradeoff I was willing to make. 5x on Amex Platinum offsets that a bit too. And we now get to fly far superior airlines (especially EVA, the holy grail of J), try the new product on United, and get more time in Thailand. 

To cancel and rebook the ticket cost 3,000 miles per person which I had already transferred months ago in anticipation of cancelling and rebooking. I called in, fed the agent the dates and flight numbers, and went on hold a couple of times while she confirmed the space and calculated the taxes. Then she simultaneously cancelled and rebooked the flight. The mileage redeposit was instant. They saved the space, called back an hour later for me to pay the taxes, and then everything was ticketed instantly. 

I guess my message is that Star Alliance does have some decent last minute availability, especially ANA. So, if you're planning a RTW and you find a good-but-not-great itinerary, go ahead and book it to have *something* and then keep an eye out to rebook later--maybe even at the last minute like we did. I didn't even feel like there was any ""risk"" involved since the cancellation and rebooking was instantaneous after confirming everything was truly available. Of course this is all anecdotal, but I thought this sub would enjoy the data point on what has become a pretty popular award strategy. 

Thanks for reading my longest-ever self post and happy travels!"

My departure dates are any time between December 12-14, 2018.

I had my eyes on a Japan Airlines flight into San Diego bookable through Alaska Airlines only to have a warning message say the flights disappeared once I entered all our details and tried to pay. I called Alaska agents, they couldn't book it either, and Cathay Pacific award flights were almost non-existent except for a few Premium Economy seats (only 35,000 Alaska Miles, but it's only 50,000 for Cathay Business so seems like best not to book that).

Sooo, I have 130,000 Alaska Miles saved for this booking that looks like I can't use because of no availability on Japan Airlines or Cathay Pacific. 

I have about 500,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points I could use, but I really wanted to use the Alaska Miles.

Anyway, I really wanted business class all the way back to the states. Our final destination is Portland, but we don't mind spending the night somewhere and then taking Southwest flights (we have the companion pass) to Portland. 

I found a one way from Bangkok into San Jose, California for 90k United Miles on business class. 

Just trying to see if anybody else out there can point me in the right direction.

I've done a decent amount of research looking into how to get there, but still struggling with what to pull the trigger on now, or if I should wait until later.

* Charlottetown - YYG is on the island
* Moncton - YQM is about 1 1/2 hours drive
* Halifax - YHZ is about 3 1/2 hours drive from PEI



^^^^^.
**Awardhacker  shows:**

* Air Canada (25k RT)
* United (25k RT)
* Avianca (25k RT)
* Singapore (25k RT)
* ANA (30k RT)
* Lufthansa (30k RT)
* EVA (39k RT)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

^^^^^.
For my specific situation:

**Available Currencies:**

* UR: 800k, MR: 700k, AA: 900k, TYP: 70k, CNB: 45k

**Ideal itinerary would be:** 

* 2 passengers in Y or J
 
*  7/14: DEN --> YHZ

* 7/19: YYG or YQM --> DEN

^^^^^.
I am looking to be in Halifax as early as possible on 7/14, to be able to drive up to Inverness and play golf at Cabot Links in the afternoon on 7/14 and Cabot Cliffs in the morning on 7/15.  Then driving/taking the ferry to PEI in the afternoon on 7/15.  Since YHZ is over 3 hours from the wedding location, ideally, we'd fly out of YYG or YQM on the way back.  So I'm looking for one-way or multi-city awards.

^^^^^.
I've looked extensively through Star Alliance partner sites (Aeroplan, United, Singapore, EVA, Avianca) and haven't come up with any great options for the return flight.

^^^^^.
**Outbound Options:**

Airline | Date | Departure City | Departure Time | Arrival City | Arrival Time | Layover City/Duration | Flight No | Cabin | Ticket Cost | Award Taxes | Award Miles | Miles from rev Flight | Cash Equivalent Flight | CPP | CPPCE
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Air Canada | 7/13/20 | DEN | 20:20 | YHZ | 9:37 | YYZ / 5hrs | AC1040/AC602 | Y | $653 | $82.04 | 12,500 | Unknown | $653 | 4.568 | 4.568
United | 7/13/20 | DEN | 20:20 | YHZ | 9:37 | YYZ / 5hrs | AC1040/AC602 | Y  | Not Shown on United | $27.00 | 12,500| Unknown | $653 | Can't Find | 5.008

^^^^^.

**For the outbound flights, I have many good options.**  

Again, I'm looking for 2 people, and I don't want to be exhausted on 7/14/20, so spending 1:28 am til 6:45 am at Toronto's airport doesn't sound that appealing.  A positioning flight after work on 7/13, to either BOS or PHL using SW CP and then staying at hotel sounds like a much easier travel day.  The AA CPP is obviously inflated and a great redemption, but arriving at 14:00 vs. 12:27, when I have to drive another 3.5 hrs to make a late afternoon Tee Time makes a big difference.  I'm most likely going to book the BOS-->YHZ using CNB Crystal points through the concierge.


^^^^^.
**Inbound Options:**


Airline | Date | Departure City | Departure Time | Arrival City | Arrival Time | Layover City/Duration | Flight No | Cabin | Ticket Cost | Award Taxes | Award Miles | Miles from rev Flight | Cash Equivalent Flight | CPP | CPPCE

^^^^^.
**Inbound options are much more limited and more expensive**
I can't get United to show any mid day flights from YYG or YQM to DEN, it's only showing me flights with 5am-7am departure times.  I also can't find any fixed mileage awards on Aeroplan, so it looks like I'm limited to paying dynamic prices on Aeroplan or redeeming through the Chase Portal or CNB (until I run out of points there).  

Since timing is fairly similar between YQM and YYG flights, I'll gladly pay 6,000 miles to not have to drive 1.5 hrs to YQM.  Similarly, I'll gladly pay $28 to have 1 stop vs. 2 stops.  So it looks like the best inbound flight is the first one listed - YYG - DEN 12:10 - 20:33 for $74.96 out of pocket and 45,700 miles.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

^^^^^.
**Questions:**

1. Is it possible to call in to United and get their pricing for the Air Canada flights on 7/19 even though I can't find them online?
2.  There are 2 Air Canada flights that I can't find available on points through Aeroplan.  Will these potentially become available later?  Can I call and see if I can book that way?
3.  Is there a better Star Alliance parter (Singapore, Avianca, ANA, etc) where I could get a better award ticket price on 7/19?  Or would there need to be a Fixed Mileage Award available on AC for that to be possible?  I don't see any flights coming up in the other Star Alliance partners search engines
4.  I know this will be high season in Prince Edward Island, but I would expect flight prices to come down some, does it make sense to wait on the award booking?

I'd like to burn through my TYP, so if this is somehow bookable on SQ, I'd love to do that.

**TLDR:** I know this is long, and if you made it this far, I commend you.  Thank you for any help or advice with getting to and from PEI is greatly appreciated."

Snow day here in NYC. Might as well write this up as I was procrastinating. Long post here


In January I flew a Round the World Trip. Years ago I read a blog post about Singapore Airline Suites and its been my dream since to fly it. In June 2016 I finally convinced myself to hop on the waitlist for suites on January 12th 2017. 


I finally got off the waitlist 1 week before my flight. Tears were rolling down my eyes when I received the text. Now it was a scramble to figure out the rest of my trip and how the hell am I going to fly back.


I read TPG’s post on his trip to the Maldives(I know, I know). I realized I probably won’t be this close to the Maldives again. Unfortunately there was no free nights available through the Hyatt certs but points nights were. I moved 75k UR over and booked 3 nights there. There was also no availability on award flights to MLE so I booked a one way cash flight on Tigerair for $150.


As for the Suites flight, once I shown the flight attendants my ticket, they quickly lead me to my Suite. I was so giddy. The seat itself was so comfy and huge. I even got to experience the double beds in the middle as there was only 3 passengers in Suites including myself. My dream was came true. I spent about 2 days in Singapore, then off to the Maldives


My god the Park Hyatt Maldives was beautiful. I’ve never been on a resort or an isolated island before so this was luxurious to me. I loved the outdoor shower. Unfortunately I didnt get into the Park Hyatt until 2am the first night. And the food was mighty expensive. I blew $700 on food for only 2 nights.


After 2 nights it was time to fly back to SIN. I managed to snag a Y fare on Srilankan airlines using BA Avios. 


After reading many good reviews about ANA and JAL, I wanted an excuse to fly it. I found a one way 40k ANA F flight from SIN to NRT. As a big Star Wars fan, I was ecstatic to found out my plane was the BB-8 plane all with Star Wars music playing as I entered in. The seat wasn’t as comfy as Suites but still better than economy. 


This was my 3rd time in Tokyo, second time being just last month in December. I flew the MSP-HND Delta route for 50k during their sale. Eat and partied like usual. I would never have thought I could go to Tokyo back to back months.


Flying back to NYC, I managed to get a seat with JAL F for 80k AA miles. I love the free massage at the Sakura lounge and the sushi bar. 


All and all I started off 2017 with a big bucket list flight itinerary. JFK-FRA-SIN-MLE-CMB-SIN-NRT-JFK all within 11 days. I’m not sure what the cash value is for this entire trip but its hella more than I’m willing to pay for.


Service and good among all 3 F flights were amazing. This was my first time flying F and I had high expectations and met every single one. ANA and JAL do have a better snack menu than SIN.


Heres a breakdown of points for my trip off the top of my head.

JFK-FRA-SIN, about 90K UR points after SIN’s 15% discount

SIN-MLE, $150 on tigerair

PH Maldives transport, $500 on my arrival+

MLE-CMB-SIN, about 15k Avois

SIN-NRT, 40k UR on ANA F using United

NRT-JFK, 80k AA

PH Maldives, 75k UR 3 nights


Other comments. 

The Virgin America lounge in JFK is beautiful. I wish I had more time here but I was stuck on the subway coming over. 


I also managed to get into the Private Room at SIN on an arrival flight. Told desk agent I was waiting for friend to arrive.


I usually stay in hostels for my travels. Save some money and met other travelers along the way. The F flights to hostels were definitely a big change.

146,Honeymoon Trip to Italy+Greece Redemption Help,3,c24yse,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c24yse/honeymoon_trip_to_italygreece_redemption_help/,17,2019-06-18 21:16:16,"Hi all, I'm planning on a honeymoon trip for roughly May 2020 (dates flexible), for around a 2 weeks. We are planning on going to Italy and Greece (Naples, Rome, Amalfi Coast, Athens, Santorini, Mykonos), so I assume we would fly into FCO or NAP and out of ATH, or vice versa. We haven't decided an itinerary yet, so we can do either order (Greece then Italy, or Italy then Greece).

We are aiming to fly F or J for both of the longer international flights, but we are fine with economy for connections within Europe. We are based out of SFO. I would prefer only 1 layover, and don't really want to re-position or overshoot unless its really good value.

I've been on /r/churning for a while and have amassed a good amount of points, but haven't ever done a miles redemption before for premium flights, so I am a bit confused about what is the best option for redemption for value, availability, and product. I'm also not sure when I should start looking for flights, since its roughly a year out (but I've heard that you have to start this early sometimes). So I am hoping you guys can help us out here with strategy.

I did some research, and it seems like there are only 4 airlines that have first class from SFO to Europe (BA, SWISS, Air France, Lufthansa). SWISS and Air France seem to only release F awards to their elite members, and Lufthansa has that 15 days before rule, so those all seem to be ruled out. BA I was told is not a great F product, so I wasn't sure if that was worth it.

For J flights, I saw the following airlines:

* Aer Lingus
* Air France
* Turkish
* SWISS
* Iberia
* United
* Delta

Between the two of us, we expect to have at least the following points by October that we could transfer:

* 400k UR
* 200k MR
* 100k TYP
* 120k Marriott
* We have negligible amounts of miles with UA, AA, CX as well (roughly 10k each)

As for status, we only have the following (until end of year):

* CX Silver (myself)
* AA Gold (P2)
* United Silver (possibly, through corporate status match)

147,help with where to start - flight to Scotland,0,arrik6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/arrik6/help_with_where_to_start_flight_to_scotland/,17,2019-02-18 04:16:55,"My boyfriend and I want to get to Edinburgh sometime in the June - September time frame. We have miles with United (132k), American (122k and 111k), and Delta (104k and 94k). We would like to fly with some more comfort than just economy. We are based in Atlanta.

The easier question: We're thinking premium economy going over and business coming back. How, when I'm searching for flights, do I know what kind of plane we'll be traveling on to know what kind of seat we would be getting? (I'm assuming we'll want ""reclining"" and not ""standard"" on the premium econ.)

I called United today and they said no other airline has released them yet for a July flight -- only Lufthansa. I was told to sit tight and keep checking as they have no insight when they will be released.

149,"Minimizing annual fees, maintaining 1:1 transfers",5,35v582,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/35v582/minimizing_annual_fees_maintaining_11_transfers/,17,2015-05-13 23:46:32,"Hi all,

I've amassed quite a few chase UR points (210k+), and probably will be getting more.

The main issue is that the only cards that allow 1:1 transfer on airlines have annual fees of at least $95, which could burn through that value pretty quickly.

Right now I have a CSP which will expire in November.  Once that happens, what's my best plan?

I believe there are only 1 or 2 other chase cards that allow the 1:1 transfer (2 versions of chase ink I think).

The CSP could be canceled and re-churned 2 years later, but what about in-between?

My thoughts:

1.  I could transfer some of the points to an airline, but don't know where I'm going yet, so would have to take a best guess.  United would probably be the safest.

2.  The ink card seems like it might be a good long-term play since it offers 5% back on cell phone + internet/tv usage.  For me that's $172/month, or $2064 per year.  5% is 4% more than I'd normally get at 1%, so I suppose I'd already be making $82 back extra in points, which mostly covers the $95 fee.

Any other ideas?  Find a way to rotate cards in and re-churn every other year?  What other cards for chase offer 1:1?

Right now, I could do:

- Year 1: CSP (opened 10/2014) - 11/2014, then cancel/downgrade
- Year 2: Chase ink (apply in 11/2014) - good through 12/2014

At this point , could I churn the CSP?  Does that 24-month churn rule apply from the date you first applied, or from the end of your first period?  If the latter I suppose I could just keep the ink open for another year since the 5% utility cash back is pretty good."

Here is the situation: My stepfather is an authorized user on my mother's Amex card, where she has accrued 200,000 MR points. My mother had been battling Alzheimer's for many years, and was unable to transfer any of her points over to her husband before her condition worsened. My stepfather has power of attorney, and can manage her accounts, but will need to close the account soon, since she recently passed away. Because he cannot transfer the MR points out to another Amex card, I thought his best bet would be to transfer them to an airline or hotel.

I was hoping to help him use these points, perhaps on a much-needed vacation. When he flies, he usually uses AA or United. However, since neither of these airlines are transfer partners with MR, I need to find another use for them. 

Are there any downsides to him just transferring all of the points to Cathay Pacific? I thought this would be best, since he could then use them on AA flights, but I am not experienced enough in this hobby to know if I am missing any pitfalls.

I transferred them to Etihad Guest and then used their amazing partner rates on Brussels Airlines to score the tickets. I called the Etihad UK call center because they apparently have the best trained CS reps there. 

The only real issue was that I found plenty of availability on United's website... but the Etihad CS reps couldn't see it despite me calling 5x to different reps. I think it's because the blogs just picked up on this deal today, so hundreds of people are likely booking it up and the United site hasn't updated yet (just a theory). Well on my 6th call, I finally tried a new combination of dates and they could see it too! I had such an adrenaline rush when they confirmed lol.

159,"Want to go to Asia or other long-haul destinations next summer, is it worth pursuing current Avios deal or should I focus on another program?",7,3lea39,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3lea39/want_to_go_to_asia_or_other_longhaul_destinations/,16,2015-09-18 09:10:21,"/u/LumpyLump76 kicked this question out of /r/churning because he says I posted it on the wrong day of the week, so I am trying again here.

tl;dr: I can probably get myself up to 200-250k Avios if I put all my eggs into the Avios basket. But is it worth it?

**First things first - my current balances** 
			
	American Airlines (AAdvantage) **	119,733		
	British Airways (Executive Club) **	72,800		
	JetBlue Airways (trueBlue) **	21,787		
	JetBlue Airways (trueBlue) **	14,836	wife	
	Southwest Airlines (Rapid Rewards) **	2,422		
	Southwest Airlines (Rapid Rewards) **	47,264 wife	
	United Airlines (Mileage Plus) **	187						
	Hyatt Gold Passport **	3,335		
	IHG Rewards Club **	6,870		
	Marriott Rewards **	17,906					
	Amex (Membership Rewards)	52,877		
	Barclaycard Arrival Plus	1980		
	Chase **	28,075	

We do not MS. I probably can't get the full 100k Avios from the current offer without MS, but if I open an LRCU account I can easily get 50k + 25k = 75k avios.

Note 1: we have the SW companion pass via my wife's account through 12/16. So no sense going for more SW points right now, we'll focus on that late next year to re-up our CP.

Note 2: Neither of us is eligible for CSP thanks to new rules. Original plan was to get 2 of those. Wife had it once 3 years ago. I have Ink+ Biz card and earn 1200 points monthly from auto billpay to cable/phone companies.

Note 3: I am not getting the current United 50k targeted offer, only the 30k offer.	

Note 4: Wife got 50k Amex MR bonus in 2014, converted points to BA Avios during 1.4x redemption, card is cancelled. Neither of us have had the Amex platinum.

Note 5: We do not MS. I am open to the idea of the $15k LRCU account hack, though.

Note 6: FICO 812, income is good.

**My trip desires**

My wife is a teacher and I have decent vacation time. We'd like to do 3-4 weeks somewhere we haven't been before that won't break the bank with food/hotels. Ideal destinations include Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Budapest, all of Asia, India, all of Africa (esp S. Africa), all of Australia/NZ. Flexible travel dates late July/August 2016. Asia is probably highest on the list for both of us, but we're open.

It would be fun to move around a bit during the trip, but neither of us love flying so we mostly want to have one long travel day coming and going and minimize flying around once we're there. 1-2 additional flight days max during the trip. It would be fun to travel in business or first but we're not going to kill ourselves getting points to upgrade. 

I've never been to London and would be open to 3-4 days there even though it's an expensive city. But I'd rather not pay their enormous taxes on ""free"" flights.

Not interested in anywhere US, Canada, Caribbean, Latin America, or Eastern Europe for this trip - we want to go somewhere new :)

Home airport is Boston, easy enough to get to JFK via JetBlue points if necessary.

**Card thoughts**

Wife and I can probably swing one more card each this fall, depending on minimum spend. Then we can probably do another card each in the winter. So we want to put those cards towards points so we can redeem them early. In the winter we can probably each do another card, probably go for hotel cards at that point. Might go for a third set of cards next spring, again with hotel cards.

My original plan was to load up on Chase UR points by getting each of us a CSP. But that plan is now ruined thanks to the 5/24 rule.

I was then going to go for United points by going for the Chase United cards, but the 50k deals seem to have vanished except for business cards - I have a biz card via Ink, not sure if I can get the United biz card or not.

Looks like I missed the 100k Amex Platinum deal (I was on vacation using my SW companion pass, so I won't complain too much!).

Am still keeping my fingers crossed that the 140k RC offer comes back so we can do a fly + stay redemption.

I have zero use for airport lounge access, fee reimbursements, or most other perks. All I want is points.

**Questions**

Given my limited options to get more AA points, get Chase UR points via CSP, or get a decent stockpile of United miles, it seems like I should focus on BA. But I have never heard anything good about Avios except short haul (we don't want short haul for this trip) and have never had great experiences with their website. And since flying F or J on BA is now ludicrously expensive via points AND has huge surcharges on BA metal via London, I'm hesitant to go all in on Avios. So...

* Should I transfer my MR points to BA before the devaluation on 10/1?
* Should I go for the current BA card offer, recognizing that I don't MS and this might present an opportunity cost if some other better offer comes up?
* Are there other offers I'm missing that will help us have a truly memorable trip?
* If I do go all-in on Avios, is there some amazing routing/destination that will maximize my fun with Avios? I really don't care too much where we go next summer as long as it's new to us and beautiful.
* If I decide not to pursue Avios as a strategy, what's should I do instead?

Thanks!"

The time has finally come that I start planning my honeymoon taking place next Oct 2020. I've been dreading this day because I would always get lost on the best approach to booking flights/hotels.

We have a combined total of 700k Ultimate Reward points. I have a Sapphire Reserve & she has a Sapphire Preferred. We're trying to go all out on this trip (business/first flights + nicer hotels) with the idea that we can book saver fares to get the most bang for 'buck'.

Based on everything I've read, sending points directly United would be my best option due to lower taxes/fuel charges, but I read this will be increasing starting next month. Average saver business pricing seems to be 140k points/pp + a couple hundred in taxes/fees with a stop somewhere on the East coast. Seems like no non-stop flights from LAX. All other airlines seem to have an exorbitant amount of fuel surcharges. As for hotels, I am not sure if I should look into Marriott/Hyatt or just book through the UR Portal.

Looking for recommendations to book the ""ultimate"" two week honeymoon from LAX to Italy (trying to hit Venice, Rome, & Amalfi Coast, likely via train)... and maybe even using the ""free"" United excursionist perk for a night or two in Paris. No preference as to what city we start/end the trip.

Main questions below, but feel free to comment on any other part of my plan:

1. Is sending UR points to United the best option for someone flying out of LAX to Italy?
2. When is the best time to start booking? I'm trying to be proactive because I can't book this last minute.
3. Hotels via Chase UR Portal or directly with Marriott/Hyatt?

I fly pretty much only for leisure (concerts, vacations, tourism, etc) at let's say a maximum of 20 per year but usually less (avg 15)





__________________

I've been doing some calculations (on the major programs) and to be honest they just seem like they are totally not worth the time and effort put in

If I stick with United and accounting for taxes, I would have to spend around ~7000$ just to get enough for a free economy flight that is realistically worth about 800$ max

Meanwhile I could score deals with airlines that United have no partnerships when travelling internationally that are on average like 200$ less EACH TIME 

so by the time you want to redeem mileage you're actually either getting back some of those differences or gaining very very little that I would say it's not worth the time at all

My first question stems from the appearance that many flights' award levels seem to already be unavailable.  I am looking at a June 23 departure.  Are they in fact, taken already or are they still to be made available?  Is it better for whatever reason to arrange this on the phone with a rep rather than use their webpages?


Secondly:  One option may be to buy economy class tickets and then use points to upgrade to business.  This is something that I have never done before.  So, I look on United.  First problem is that JFK flights direct to TYO do not seem to be candidates to be upgraded.  That annoying.  Second, when I do for choose to use EWR I get a fare quote but only with ""Upgrade waitlist"" ... is this typical?  I do not want to have any question that I have these tickets as business class.  Are upgrades not definite?  Is this just a United thing or standard practice on all airlines?

Any advice, insight is appreciated.  Thanks!"

I am looking for any advice on how to get the most points possible to make this trip happen.

2. Should I just book two one way award ticket from IAD - LON and FRA- IAD and book remaining tickets with British Airways miles ( transferring UA to BA)? Would be interested to know about any airlines that offer free stopover and open Jaw..

My findings so far:

AA
----
All during the summer and until mid sept, confirmable upgrade space on AA was readily available 1-3 days out.  It would typically appear 3 days out, and you'd have 7/7 U/C (upgrade or SAAVER biz class) seats available.  

This worked great, as long as you could be a bit flexible, but I was able to get upgraded 5/6 tries.  My strategy was to book a refundable ticket for the day I wanted, and if it became available, upgrade for only 15k miles (instead of $350+25k for discount economy).   This usually cost ~ the same and earned 1.5 EQM.

If availability didn't happen, I simply moved the date and paid the difference.  I was 2/3 with this move.

This changed mid-late sept though, and 7/7 has become 0/0.  This is frustrating and an unwelcome surprise, as it now appears that AA is releasing zero confirm-able upgrade space.  I should be exec-plat next year, but I may be traveling with (3) companions and I'm unsure of how many you can upgrade with you (paid upgrades).

UNITED
----
United typically had award flights available sporadically 1-2 months out, available for 70k miles.  This too now is gone.

DELTA
----
Occaisionally I'd find the 80k flights but I spent way less time on this one.

I'd appreciate insight but if this isn't appropriate for this sub let me know and I'll delete.

***

My brother and his wife are going on a trip and are willing to use my miles if it's a good value for me and gives them some amount of discount. I'm all for it as long as there is enough value in the discount price for me to use the points/miles.

Here's the breakdown. They want to go Seattle to Santiago Chile around the 6th/7th of December. Then on the way back they want to go from Buenos Aires to Seattle, around the 24th or 25th.

There are some great tickets on the way down. Delta, United, American Airlines all have ~30k miles + $5-$10 flights. 

On the way back there are less options and more expensive (presumably due to Christmas). 

Here are the flights on the way down:

* American Airlines one way to Santigo: 30,000 miles + $5.60
* United Airlines one way to Santiago: 30,000 miles + $5.60
* Delta Airlines one way to Santiago: 35,000 + $5.60
* Same Delta booked through Air France: 29,000 miles + $10

For returns, American Airlines is the best bet. All of these have high fees (about $90 compared to $5.60 on the way down). Looks like coming in the opposite direction has some other taxes and fees.

* United has 70k + ~$90 and really long 2-stop flights. They're an expensive currency compared to others, and long stops, so not good. 
* Delta has 100k + ~$90. This is the one mile type I don't have a lot of, and can't transfer from other points (at least not economically), so this puts it out of contention entirely.
* American has 55k + ~$90 on the 24th or 75k + ~$90 on the 25th, with one stop. I have 500k of these and they're easy to acquire more of, so this is good in all respects.

***

I sent them all of the above. I then told them:

So really your first choice is: miles or dollars. I think it needs to be all miles or all dollars. One-ways with dollars are expensive, as you saw, so doing one with dollars and one with miles won't work. Either you need to pay for the whole thing with money, or do miles both directions. 

Assuming miles:

Decide what to take on the way down. Mostly they're the same so whatever times you like more and/or whatever miles I want to use up the most.

Basically only realistic option on the way back is American Airlines, deciding whether to goon the 24th or 25th (55 or 75k miles). 

Here's two specific itineraries just to price match. Using American Airlines so that $ and miles are compared on the same exact route.

American Airlines to Santiago, coming back from BA on the 24th: 85,000 miles + $96.81. Google flights has this for $2402. https://goo.gl/flights/tUoA4 14-15 hours on the way down, 17-19 hours on the way back.

American Airlines to Santiago, coming back from BA on the 25th: 105,000 miles + $96.81. Same $2402 on Google flights. That means it's less valuable (mile wise) because more miles for same cash price. But, one extra day. 

If you were to do cash, Air Canada is cheapest at $1623 but on the way back it's 28-hour 2-stop flights. United is $2193 with 15 hours on the way there and 18 hours on the way back. So if you're going to do miles, closest comparison is United $2193 and American Airlines $2402.

Rough math:
Let's say you do the 105000 (30k+75k) miles with both ways on American Airlines and come back on the 24th from Buenos Aires. That's $90 ish in fees, $100 to make it easy for rough calculations. So 105000 miles gets you 2402-100=2302 of flight value. Obviously if you were doing cash you'd be going for United. $2193 would get you back $98 of value as points per person (3% and then 1.5 cents each value, so 4.5%). So anything more than $98 off the price is ""valuable"" to you in that scenario, though $99 off probably isn't worth it.

*** 

**Ok, context done**

So how much is ""fair"" (""fare"", even) in this case? If they paid me $1700 per person that would be $1600 (after paying fees) for 105,000 AA miles which is just over 1.5 cents each. I know they're worth more for various aspirational flights but I'm not taking those, so I shouldn't benchmark against that. Is 1.5 for normal travel good for that? Or should I do something like $1900 (so $1800 after paying fees)?

Small side-note: I have some AA gift cards which would work perfectly for paying these fees if we do this. They each have a reserve, if I paid the fees with $1 on each of their Reserves and the rest on GC they'd still get protection benefits, right? Even if it's miles? As long as the Reserve is used for at least once cent to pay for the booking it's good?

Would really appreciate help with this! They're fine with whatever number. I want to be fair to them (ie not offering just $10 off what they could get with cash, for example) but I also don't want to lose ""too much"" in point value. Thoughts?"

I also have about 200k in URs and 155k+ in SPG if that will help to get us home.  Though, I'm trying to keep this strictly AA if I can.

I tried finding routes from SYD -> HKG -> USA -> BOS but couldn't find any award availability to get me out of the South Pacific area back into the states 1/6 or 1/7.  Also, there was nothing for SYD -> LAX or MEL -> DFW.  So it looks like for sure I'll have to do MEL -> SIN -> ??

Thank you for your help!

EDIT: Thank you everyone.  I was able to find J availability from SYD -> AUH and more J availability from AUH -> JFK all with Etihad.  The trick was to call the AA office in New Zealand to book the tickets that the US agents could not see.  Then, JFK -> BOS (15k AA)."

I'm looking to do a European trip for me and my girlfriend in J class. We would be leaving from LAX and are looking to do Italy and Paris. Travel date is flexible between Jan-March and trip would be about 2 weeks or so.

Currently looking at doing Italy for about 9 to 10 days and do Rome to Florence to Venice then Paris for 4 or 5 days.

My current balances are
UR 305k
UA 55K 

Looking at award bookings via United's site, it looks like this
- LAX to ZRH to FCO via Swiss Airlines on their Boeing 777-300ER via a Business Saver Award at 70k + $21.50
- Return is CDG to ZRH to LAX via Swiss Airlines on their Boeing 777-300ER via a Business Saver Award at 70k + $116.66

A few questions:
- Ideally I would like to use the 55k UA miles and save as much UR as possible, so in total I'm looking at around 280k miles for 2 J's roundtrip.

- Is there a better way to utilize open jaw rules? Or should I just do 1 ways to and from Europe?

- Is there a better transfer partner to utilize the UR points?

192,United award travel: Questions and Clarifications,14,44ep81,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/44ep81/united_award_travel_questions_and_clarifications/,14,2016-02-06 07:33:27,"I was gonna post about my trip as a whole, but I had so many things I wanted to clarify about United's travel that I think it warranted a separate post (still ended up being long, haha)

A friend got me started with churning and playing the credit card game, but I've also learned a shitton in the last 4 months thanks to you peeps here and in /r/churning.  I've racked up just over 100k Chase UR points, and I want to use it for a 4-month long backpacking trip starting from April to August. 

Because I only have Chase UR points, it seems like transferring them to United is my best option based on their 2 open-jaw, 1 stopover policy for a round trip.  That means I can book the whole length of my trip as one round trip, which sounds too good to be true! Because I'm gonna use United, I have a bunch of things I want to clarify with you guys. Most of what I've learned comes from this article: http://travelisfree.com/2014/08/26/united-routing-rules/ Here's what I understand so far. Please correct me if I'm wrong about anything!

**My Current Understanding:**

- United changed the rules recently, so you can only have open-jaws in your destination region.  
- The destination region is determined by which region is more ""powerful"". 
- Because my flights go through Asia and Europe, and Asia is more ""powerful"", United makes Asia my ""destination"", and I'm free to have a stopover in Italy.  
- this also means that I don't have a choice of making Europe my ""destination"" and use my open-jaws in Europe, when thats more useful (spending more time in Europe). 
- Stopover length is 6 months, but that's not a problem since my total trip length is 4months. 
- When I transfer points to United, it gets stored in my United mileage account.  Then, the way I use them determines the Saver, Standard or MileagePlus awards.  (It initially seemed like there were 3 or more different account choices to transfer to, which totally confused me)

Again, if i seem wrong/confused about anything, please correct me!

**My Trip Preferences**

- Chase UR: 102k points
- LAX is home, surrounding airports work too, as well as SFO (I could drive to SF beforehand if something works out better) 
- Travel Destinations: Singapore (quick visit, < 3days), Shanghai(3 weeks), Taipei(5 days), Italy(1 month), bunch cities all over Europe (5 days each)
- Cabin Preference: Economy
- Just me as the traveler 

**My Best Option:**
I searched for this in United's search engine

- LAX(home) - SIN(singapore)   :   End of April 
- SHA(shanghai) - FCO(rome)    :   End of May
- FCO(rome) - LAX(home)         :   End of August 

This uses 1 open-jaw and 1 stopover.  If I try to book a 2nd open jaw while in China, I get a ""We were unable to process your request"".  So without dealing with that or calling in, I think this is my best option.  It costs 75k points + $117, which seems like a great deal compared to the ""Purchase without redeeming miles"" option of $7,449.    

**My Questions:**

1. If I'm using Chase UR points, is the decision to transfer them to United even the best option? Did I miss a better option?
2. Is there a way to make Europe my ""destination""?  If it were possible, this would be a better option, because I'm spending a majority of my time in Europe and I could book my two open-jaws there
3. Based on my current search, am I getting the best deal? 75k points + $117.  
4. I mean 10c/pt is really awesome, but how do I know I'm actually getting a good deal, vs United just showing me a really expensive ticket price in the ""Buy without miles"" option to make me feel good?  
5. aka-How do you peeps calculate your cents per point valuation?
6. Because I might only need to use 1 open-jaw, 1 stopover, maybe Singapore Airlines is a better option?  <- I'm now doing some reading into that, but for now clarification on United Awards would be appreciated. I'll learn about Singapore Awards myself, and probably have a followup post similar to this focused on Singapore Airlines. 
7. If there's anything I missed, let me know!

I have Chase Ultimate Rewards 141,000; Cap One 53k; Delta 80k.

Would like to leave somewhere between 2 weeks from now and by at latest the 2nd week in September.
Leaving about 3 or 4 weeks from now probably best for time to prepare, etc. but could get out in 2 weeks if needed.

I've only checked Chase's travel portal so far.
Want to avoid Chinese airlines based on what I've read (which are the cheapest flights)  and would like to get there in approx. 24 - 28 hours. (i.e., don't want to take a 35 hour flight for cheaper rate - unless amazing deal or great deal on upgrade involved).

The best prices for economy and my qualifications on the Chase portal [EDIT - for round trip economy] are in this range:
Aug. 29th:  All Nippon  $798.26/ 53,217 miles   23:58 hrs./min.; also - 
Aug. 29th  United  $802.16/ 53477 United 24:13  

so I would be using the miles at the 1.5 cents/mile that Chase Sapphire Reserve gives.

Would consider Premium Economy or Business if a great deal.

Knowledgable people like all of you can probably do a lot better - would be grateful for any guidance, or point me to a site to help me do better with my miles, or suggestions to get me started.

It's a bit overwhelming at the minute.

195,Wild ride with LifeMiles,12,7lxzev,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7lxzev/wild_ride_with_lifemiles/,14,2017-12-25 01:40:18,"OK. You guys know I book a lot of travel for clients. This is the kind of crazy stuff I do for my own travel. I thought of posting this in /r/awardstoriesgonewild (and might cross-post it) but it's here for now. I'm going to blog about this too but in a lot less detail and a lot higher level.

I'm going to St. Helena on Saturday. It's one of the toughest places in the world to visit. The only similarly difficult place I have visited is Adak, Alaska (Antarctica was more difficult, but doesn't really count because there are no commercial flights there).

The way that you get to St. Helena is from Johannesburg or Cape Town via Windhoek. There is one flight a week, which is absurdly expensive. I wrote more about the flight and the airport here if anyone is interested: http://www.seat31b.com/2017/12/ringing-in-the-new-year-in-st-helena/ - it was cheaper for me to do this as an open jaw terminating in CPT and I wanted to end up in CPT anyway.

The hardest part of making all of this work was booking an award ticket to Johannesburg in the most peak part of peak season. This is, as most people know, nearly impossible. What saved me is that I decided to do this at the last minute (at least for the time being, I have enough control over my schedule to do this). Cathay Pacific opens up award inventory starting 2 weeks before departure and they opened up one seat in F from SFO-HKG on the date I needed. There were plenty of seats onward in J from there to JNB. And as luck would have it, AS had a single Y seat available from SEA-SFO so I was able to get an award all the way through. Using the exceptionally generous Alaska award chart, this trip cost only 70k miles so I went ahead and booked it. This got me 13,541 flown miles in CX F and J for just 70,000 Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles.

The problem was getting back. I really didn't want to fly to South Africa without a ticket home and there wasn't any availability in J or F on CX. While I usually fly economy class, it's a loooooooooong flight from South Africa - Africa is **huge** and the flight from Europe to South Africa is as long or longer than a transatlantic flight to Europe. And although economy class was wide open with every mileage currency I had, this just isn't a good use of points due to the relatively cheap economy class fares (around $500 all-in paid vs. 40k points + $100+ with most mileage currencies).

So, my goal was to get back in a premium cabin, and to use my Avianca LifeMiles. I don't trust all of the mileage sales that LifeMiles has had recently, and don't really trust the shaky financial condition of Avianca either, so wanted to clean out my account before the devaluation that I suspect is coming. Also, while I'm not generally a premium cabin traveler, it has gotten very hard to book premium cabins with LifeMiles lately which in my opinion is another bad sign for the program (while the airline accounting behind the scenes is secret, it's widely believed that airlines pay considerably more in cash for business and first class redemptions vs. economy class). I also thought it would be cool to route directly back to North America or via Europe vs. returning via Asia, since this makes the trip a true RTW.

Well, when I went to check the new LifeMiles site, some really crazy stuff happened. It started pulling up mixed cabin awards, which are new. An itinerary combining one Lufthansa segment in Y from JNB-FRA and UA segments in F from FRA-ORD and Y from ORD-SNA cost under 50k points. Note that Europe-NA in J is 63k points on the LifeMiles chart, so I have no idea how the calculation was being done. Another itinerary in J from JNB-FRA-LHR (Y) + LHR-SFO (J) was 51k points. Note that one way in J on a through routing, no mixed cabins, is 78k points on this route so a *substantial* discount is being given for Y segments on mixed cabin itineraries.

What I really wanted, and what was available in Starnet, was either SAA from JNB-IAD in J and UA from IAD-SEA (but I didn't like the timing of this flight), or SAA from JNB-LHR in J and UA from LHR-ORD in J and ORD-SEA in Y. But there were two major problems: nothing at all on South African comes up on the LifeMiles site and there is no way to make it appear, and the flight from ORD-SEA wasn't coming up either, even though it was obviously available.

I gritted my teeth and decided to suck up a Y leg from JNB-FRA, figuring F from FRA-ORD might make up for it (*might* being the operative word, it's United after all). I got all the way to the end, plugged in my credit card information, and BAM - the site puked. Tried again, fail. OK, called LifeMiles, and the friendly representative informed me that basically everything was broken on the site right now and not to expect to book anything through it. So I could either book with him for an $80 fee, or I could take screen shots and email them to support@lifemiles.com for assistance at no fee.

I went ahead and did it, also telling the support desk my preferred dates and cities (I wanted to end up in Seattle). They wrote back a day later asking for a picture of my passport, which I provided. Another day later, I got an email informing me that my request had been escalated and to watch my email because when my itinerary was booked I'd have to call LifeMiles to pay within 24 hours.

A full day later, at the end of the day, and with absolutely no context I got a confirmation (in Spanish) for a flight to Seattle. It was LH in Y from JNB-FRA, UA in F from FRA-ORD, and UA in Y from ORD-SEA. Sweet! I got on the phone to the Avianca call center and one of the strangest, craziest things that has ever happened with an airline transpired.

The call center representatives were familiar with the type of booking I had, but they couldn't do anything with it. There is apparently a department inside LifeMiles with one guy working there at any given time, and you have to be transferred to him. His English isn't great but he's super friendly and very nice. When he reviewed the itinerary with me and asked if it's what I wanted, I said ""well, this isn't exactly what I wanted, can you check if another itinerary is available?"" He agreed, so I gave him the specific itinerary I wanted (from the United Web site).

So, this guy is working directly in Amadeus and pulling inventory from Starnet. And that means two things are happening. The first is that none of the Starnet blocking on the LifeMiles site applies (and there is more of this blocking than not). The second is that they literally have no idea how to price mixed cabin itineraries, because whatever formula the Web site uses to calculate award pricing isn't available to the call center representatives. So they're empowered to estimate what an award should cost and astonishingly, you can actually negotiate this.

I ended up with an award costing 72,000 LifeMiles from JNB-SEA because one of the legs (ORD-SEA) is in Y. This looks pretty close to right and I don't feel like I got away with negotiating a cheaper price than I should have paid - similar itineraries on other airlines with similar lengths of domestic legs in Y reflect a similar discount.  Still, when you're calling in to book an award, be sure to remind them of the difference in mixed cabin pricing and have some plausible numbers in mind for the mileage discount you want to request (based on itineraries that price out online). Of course, this will not be an issue if you're calling in for help with ticketing an itinerary that fully appears online, because you can back up the pricing with screen shots; the negotiation only applies if you change the itinerary when you're talking to the call center.

About dealing with the Avianca call center: The representatives are in Colombia and El Salvador where Spanish is the first language. It really helps if you can speak Spanish, but if you can't, speak clearly, don't talk too fast, and use simple vocabulary. A lot of people complain about the LifeMiles call center but I think they just don't have experience working with people in Latin America. The representatives are friendly and helpful if you are friendly to them, and show them some respect. Latin America is actually a very polite culture so saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" and exchanging polite greetings goes a long way toward making you someone they want to help vs. just another rude gringo.

Am I going to be sipping Krug champagne on a flight some blogger thinks is ""aspirational?"" Nope! But none of that stuff really matters. I'm getting a perfectly reasonable lie flat seat for 9,574 miles of flying, plus Y for another 1,721 miles, and it cost me 72,000 LifeMiles that are extremely difficult to use, and I suspect are very close to devaluing. With this redemption I managed to clean out my LifeMiles account and also to book a flight on an airline that is virtually never bookable with LifeMiles.

The only one downside? I was just shy of the points I needed so had to buy 3,000 of them. When you book over the phone LifeMiles isn't able to sell you any more miles than needed to book the award, so I ended up having to pay 3.3 cents each (I missed a mileage sale by literally one day). Still, this was only $99 which is a very small price to pay (along with the ~$100 in tax and $25 booking fee) for the award.

If I were to chase United or Delta status, I would always have chances at upgrades and boarding first because the % chance of people holding status with them is very small, because of the AA hub status.

The 2 first legs are identical. The Air Canada Rouge option is 35h35min and the United option is 35h50min, so not a huge difference. Arrival time only varies by 15 min as well. For the same number of MR points, would you pick Air Canada Rouge or United for the last leg? 

We are flying Business... The Air Canada Rouge flight is on 767-300 and the United flight is on 737-800.

Edit: Not sure if this makes a huge difference but lounge access wise we have Amex Plat and Citi Prestige.

Mucho gracias!"

How are you? I was hoping that some of you can help me out with planning a flight for my honeymoon. I know the timing might be tight, but thought I would check and see if you have any ideas! 

I want to go to LAX to HKT (Phuket) for about 2 weeks in July. I would love to stop in Tokyo as well for 2-3 days. 

Here are the points I have available:
Ultimate Rewards: 200K
Membership Rewards: 130K
United Points (parent's account): 300K 

The dates are not set in stone and can be any time on or after July 1st 2016. Ideally, we would love to be on a plane with lie flat seats, but it isn't necessary. I'm not looking to blow though all of my points on a flight (especially my parents), so if there are some good economy options, I'm all ears :-). No preference for airline :). 

Thanks a lot! "

Amateur points enthusiast here. Probably not on the same level as many of you and have never made a huge points redemption for travel which is why I'm seeking out your help.

I'm fortunately able to take a full 6 week vacation next year and am trying to figure out how best to take a round trip to Europe for both me and my wife flying first class. We have quite a few points accrued in various places, but I've no idea the best way to redeem them. 

Our dates are flexible by maybe a week in either direction, but we want to leave the last week of July and return the first week of September. We're in the Bay Area and are okay from leaving from any airport here, though SJC or SFO are preferable. And we'd like to fly in and out of London if possible as we have some family there, but again that part is flexible... Most major cities are realistic options (Rome, Paris, anywhere in Spain).

Here's a rundown of my points:

* 100k+ Chase Ultimate Rewards
* 160k+ Virgin America Elevate
* 30k+ SPG

And here's a rundown of my wife's:

* 100k+ Chase Ultimate Rewards
* 60k Virgin America Elevate

My first thought is converting all Virgin and SPG points to Alaskan, and then finding a mutual transfer partner (Virgin Atlantic maybe? BA? United? Not sure best option here) and just book with points. But my strengths have been on the accumulating side of points and have yet to make a major points purchase, so I wanted to seek out help and advice on how best to accomplish this. 

And I would say our priority is more experience than best redemption rate. We'd rather have a better flight experience than have a slightly better redemption rate if there's a significant different in airlines.

Thanks in advance for the advice!"

I was thinking of trying to find award availability for the new SQ flight from EWR-SIN non stop. Doesn't even look like SQ is releasing any availability at all which is concerning. I checked 350 days out and no saver at all for EWR-sing, checked as far as I could and still nothing. I was able to find JFK-FRA-SIN availability so I don't think its because there is no availability, maybe they are not releasing any at all for that flight ?

I tried to look at a backup plan of JFK-NRT/HND-BKK using VS miles. I went to look on United airlines for availability and I also couldn't find any 300 days out. 

What I am wondering was I too slow to look for availability or is there just not as much availability as I hoped for.  

I am looking at what other good value options there are to fly to Far East from east coast USA. I have ~350k UR ~150k MR, and ~100k AA to play with. "

I didn't take it too seriously before and have mostly flown JetBlue because I don't/didn't think I'd fly enough to get any worthwhile status on another airline, but am reconsidering and would love some thoughts from the group here. I really like their product and service all around and the frequency/timing of direct flights from JFK to the west coast, but realizing even if I hit Mosaic status, it's not really helpful as you don't get upgrades with it, and with no alliance/without many partners, I mainly get more JetBlue flights.

I also have heard from many people (and here) that since there are so many hardcore business flyers out of JFK, the odds of getting regular upgrades on my routes at a lower tier of status are pretty slim. Would consider opening another credit card to speed up/amplify benefits/miles earned. Currently use my CSR for everything.

My priority is to make my primary travel (to the West Coast) as comfortable as possible, but miles and upgrades for my vacations and other trips would be a nice bonus, just not sure I'll get any of them. I like JetBlue & Alaska (experiences, product, companies), am indifferent to AA/Delta, and despise United (plus don't want to be stuck with everything being out of EWR).

I like Delta's ~~transfer partners~~ alliance a bit more and my recent research makes me think I'd do okay with them. How's the product on the transcon flights on the 757? Would I actually \_get\_ any upgrades with Delta gold? (Maybe could even squeeze out Platinum if I shifted some of my other travel).

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

Stats:

* I'm based in NYC, my preferred airport (by a long stretch) is JFK.
* Generally, I fly to the West Coast (SFO or LAX) for work at least 6 times a year, as well as various other ad hoc trips. Most domestic, but occassional international popping up as well. I'd generally be in Premium Economy but can sometimes get Business Class fares in my range.
* For personal travel, my future MIL is based in LA, so we usually go out there at least 2 more times a year. Plus other trips/vacations (3-4 times a year, sometimes domestic, sometimes international- South America and Europe recently and the near future).
* I'm on track to fly a little over 55k miles this year, likely the same or more next year as well."

Virgin America Elevate is around 53,000 (212,000 total) but I don't see any way to transfer to Elevate.

Alaska is 60,000 (240,000)[and cheaper than Elevate if I do the current Elevate to Alaska transfer] but I don't see any way to transfer to Alaska.

Right now I'm stuck with American through the Chase Portal and with flights that I don't really like.

We are located in DEN so my first thought is United, but we also have a ton of Southwest points and could easily do a positioning flight if need be. 330 days from Thanksgiving '19 would roughly be the end of December, so currently I am just wondering what you all would recommend as the best course of action for airlines/flights to look into. Business/First would be nice if they are reasonably priced, but we have no problem going with Economy if need be since it is a relatively short transatlantic flight. I know about the large fees when flying back from the UK, so we are also considering doing 5 days in London and then 1-2 in Paris before heading home (we have both been to Paris several times, so the 1-2 days would be sufficient for us - London is really our focus of this trip). 

We currently have ~190k UR, 150k Marriott, and once the points post will have ~220k MR and ~150k RR and CP. We have also been planning on grabbing several more MR cards so that number will likely increase rather drastically before next November unless there is a better avenue to take in preparation for the trip."

I'm trying to route EUG->JNB with a stopover in AMS on route. I've seen availability at the Saver level on United for all of the legs, but when I call ANA to check for availability, they're not able to book it. When I try and search for availability myself on their website, I'm not able to see any results. 

Two questions:
*Should I ask them to check availability on a specific route?
* Can an ANA partner booking cover multiple airlines? I think the EUG--> AMS route would require flying on both United and Lufthansa/Swiss

I apologize in advance if I don't have a total grasp on all the acronyms/rules yet!

Based on everything I've read, I'd love to avoid LHR but we will be kicking off our honeymoon by attending a wedding in Birmingham, UK on 9/4/2020, maybe spending a day or two in London, and then flying to Greece for the proper honeymoon (not sure which islands/cities yet).

I am working with Chase UR. Have about 100k but could possibly rack up an additional 20-30k in 2-3 months. Hoping to fly J on at least one of the long haul flights. We're usually economy class people so we'd like to splurge if possible. 

So far, based on Chase's transfer partners and hoping to avoid exorbitant fees (looking at you BA), United with their excursionist perk seems to be the best bet:

* ORD > LHR 60k each + fees
* LHR > ATH 0 each + fees
* ATH > ORD 30k each plus fees (probably going to just do economy on the way back)

Total: 180k + fees

I found these figures by searching random March dates, which I believe is non-peak and I assume September is the same. The dates are flexible aside from making the 9/4 wedding. 

My questions are:

Are there other airlines / programs I should be looking into for cheaper options? As I said I've dug around quite a bit so far and there are options that cost less in miles but the fees are insane.

**Most importantly**: As you can see I'll be 50-60k miles short. Would it be worth it to purchase the extra miles? Is that ever worth it? I haven't spent the CSR $300 travel credit and I believe that would be applied to purchasing those miles. I would love to collect a large chunk of miles via signup bonus, but unfortunately I'm at 5/24 with Chase (and therefore United).

If it's not worth purchasing miles, I guess I could use my UR points for rooms instead of flights and just buy economy flights with cash.

The original flight left late Sunday night. United's alternative is an Asiana Airlines flight on their A380 Sunday morning. 

Three questions:

* How does the business class product on Thai Airways 777 compare to Asiana Airlines A380? 
* As of right now, the Sunday morning flight on Asiana is the only one with award space. There is an EVA flight as well as and SQ flight that works for me, but SQ doesn't release much availability to United. Not sure if EVA does. The Asiana flight early on Sunday would require me to cancel my brunch with family the next day. Any hope booking SQ or EVA?
* Will United do anything for me for cancelling the flight? When I spoke to the agent, he basically said Thai Airways cancelled it, so they aren't going to be offering any comps. I am Gold on United if it matters.

Best I could find was 80k on United which I'd transfer from Chase. TONS of availability for 30-35k toward end of August, am I missing anything? Are the flights just sold out?"

A couple months back, United had a one day sale on flights to Hawaii with reduced award flights. I was able to get two tickets for ORD - HNL but our ultimate goal is to get to the Big Island in Hawaii. I was researching using some AA miles for that leg of the flights but it seems it's going to take 7500 miles for one way, so basically 15k miles round trip back to HNL. Seems a little steep to me for a quick flight but if that's the best I can find, I might just pay for a flight or just use that. I also thought about signing up for the Hawaiian Airlines CC to get the award miles and save my AA miles since they seem to be more flexible. If anyone has had a similar situation, please let me know what you guys did and what you think is the most cost effective way to get from hnl - koa. 
Thanks. "
232,Use Chase points for premium economy?,0,cey1xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cey1xr/use_chase_points_for_premium_economy/,12,2019-07-19 00:50:15,"Hi There,

I am looking into taking my family of four to Europe next summer. I have 300k Chase (Reserve) points and am looking at two scenarios. Buying 4 economy seats with points into London out of Paris and then paying to upgrade to premium economy (not sure of airline yet) or just using Chase points to buy the premium economy and probably end of paying in cash for one of the tickets since I won't have enough points to cover 4. Tickets for late May are running $1500 or 90-100k points for premium economy.  I know transferring the points to United or another partner is a good deal, I just always have trouble finding four seats in Business on our tight schedule. Would love advice! Thanks!"
233,[Award Advice]Please provide me some direction on how to effectively use award travel for my South America trip this time next year.,3,a5enyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/a5enyt/award_adviceplease_provide_me_some_direction_on/,12,2018-12-12 07:14:28,"Boss just approved my 3 week PTO for this time next year so that I can do an excursion through South America last two weeks of Nov, into the first week of December (90% hard dates - I could potentially delay to Jan of 2020 if I wanted). This is a solo trip.

I want to hit Colombia - that is the focal point of the trip. Having said that, since I have 3 weeks, I'd like to hit other countries. I'd be flying out of the SF Bay Area.

I plan to go full bore in my research over the next few weeks, trying to make myself an award travel pro, so that I can execute as best as possible. Having said that, I don't even have an itinerary yet so perhaps this thread is premature.

Finally, at the moment I have a bit over 100k UR's and 50k MR's. When I look at award travel into Medellin, Colombia, it seems that there's plenty this time next year, so perhaps I'm not under much pressure in terms of timing, meaning, maybe I don't have to get my tickets asap? Or maybe I'm being shortsighted? I'm thinking that I'd like to at least travel biz class on my way down to South America, but maybe that's foolish since I may want to use the awards for flights within South America? Using awards between countries is more important to me than flying J.

Any sort of tips or direction to help me get started would be greatly appreciated. Things such as recommended airlines and any other sort of excursionist perk-type (United allowing a free leg in your destination zone) services they offer.

*Also, for anyone that would like to just offer general suggestions about South America, I plan to do a little bit of everything. Backpack, stay in nice-ish hotels, hike mountains, amazon river... anything.

I appreciate you taking the time to give me advice!!!"

I currently have around 200k in UR points, 60k in MR, 60k in Delta Skymiles. 

I am planning a trip for 3 people (myself and 2 younger sisters) around end of July to mid August (preferably mid August, however I did see that Delta has flights going back from NRT to JFK for 50k Skymiles per ticket around end of August). We want to travel from NYC-->TPE-->KIX-->NRT-->JFK. I have been looking at booking award flights and they all seem pretty expensive. My current plan:

JFK-->TPE on United on domestic (105k UR points) 

TPE-->KIX on random airline for around $150 per ticket

KIX-->NRT via Shinkansen

NRT-->JFK on Delta for around 195k Skymiles, or for 150k Skymiles around end of August.


Can anyone provide some suggestions as to a better flight path or other airlines? Would I be better off trying to find a stop jaw or stopover using another airline?(P.S. I have no idea how to do it)

Basically, I would like to travel to Europe sometime in the next 2-3 years and want to start building up for free travel. Right now I use Chase rewards (Freedom and Sapphire) and redeem for SouthWest points to travel domestically in the US.

Currently I have:

- ~9.5k Delta Miles
- 50k Chase Sapphire Preferred points

My home airport Austin, but I do a good bit of travel to Atlanta every year. Considering Austin is a small airport, I have thought of combining trips and trying to leave from Atlanta.

I do not have a preferred month to travel yet, probably off season to save money. I am thinking flying into Germany somewhere and out of London.

This would be economy class for 2 people.

I have been reading on /r/churning and here, but don't seem to have a good direction to take as far as credit cards/airlines to use. I have always used Delta, being from Atlanta, but I have read a lot that their rewards are not that great. I have also looked into American Airlines, but most of the flights I looked at using points still cost ~$1.5k! I have also heard really bad things about United, so am hesitant to go that route.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

We are in NY and a relaxing mainly beach honeymoon on a nice resort with a what would usually be an out of reach destination is our goal.  We’re both to new to points and award redemption but have aggressively collected points since we got engaged. 

Current Points Summary (I’m using AMEX Gold, CSP and the CFU she’s got a CSP, Freedom and CFU)
140K UR - Her (+20k CFU SUB on the way)
100K UR - me 
70K MR 
19K TYP 

Was hoping to use points for all the airfare and lodging preferably for 10 nights. Been mainly looking at Hyatt to get a solid redemption value. The leader in the clubhouse would probably be the Grand Hyatt in Kauai but would like to go to a second island and not sure if the other Hyatt non Andaz properties would be worth it. We’ve traveled to the Caribbean a few times together and though we haven’t ruled it out we would like to go to a new part of the world for this. 

Still willing to open more cards if necessary such as the world of Hyatt or the Amex green perhaps. Not tied to Hyatt or Hawaii just thought all things considered it fit the bill. Was thinking of using the UR for the hotels and MR+TYP for airfare but everything still tentative. Seems like transferring to Singapore airlines then redeeming with United or Air France may be my best bets for Hawaii.  

Any other ideas on places to go, best ways to redeem points for airfare/resorts, or cards to still get? Still very open to plans just giving my thoughts to this point. Thanks!"

- Prefer to go with either 1 or 2 stops 
- Current points : MR 220K, UR 330K (between two accounts)

What I’ve found so far
- Chase UR portal, found BA flights (1 stop) for 230K points, valued at $3445

- Chase UR portal, found QR flights (1 stop) for 298K points, valued at $4460

- United.com, found UA flights (2 stops) for 255K + $92.16 taxes

- Asia Miles, found BA flights (1 stop) for 135000 + $1040 taxes

Few Questions

- Seems like lot of points compared to what AwardHacker website says.. Any other airlines I should be checking to find better value ?

- Fuel surcharges on Asia Miles seems high.. Any other alternatives to reduce taxes?

- Is it worth to use 70K points extra to go by Qatar (298K) compared to British Airways (230K) ?

I'm trying to figure out what are good carriers to fly and a good award program to make the best of this situation. 

As far as travel goes I'm not too particular on any specific airline. I prefer direct flights because I've missed too many transfers and being stuck in lounges is annoying. I also prefer SNA and LGB the most, but if LAX/ONT would help I can make that work too.

I see JetBlue runs LGB to BOS and has TrueBlue with some associated cards, and United runs LAX to BOS with several cards that help accrue MileagePlus miles. Which of these programs would be better?  Are there any other carriers I should be aware of?

I currently have a Chase card (CSP) with a few points. I'm open to joining new cards and mileage programs (haven't opened new credit cards in years now).

I'll most likely have to take a train, regional flight, or some transport to a larger hub city in Europe from wherever I'm at to make the trip.

My plan is to fly out of the NYC area, go to Guam, and then Japan on the way back. Hitting up Taipei or ICN would be icing on the cake since they are pretty close to each other and flights are nonstop or fairly short.

I have 85k delta miles (hopefully this month)

150k MR 

95K UR 

40k AA

I can also borrow some UR from my relatives if necessary.
My current itinerary is:

12/10 JFK to Taipei – 35k (Nonstop)

12/16 Taipei to ICN – 22k (Nonstop, Asiana Airlines / United, or Thai airways 22K)

12/19 ICN to GUM – 17.5k (1 stop, 7 hr, Asiana Airlines / United)

12/30-1/? GUM to NRT – 30k (Nonstop, United, 4 full days in Japan)

Ideally leave on 1/5… but I can probably stay few more days if needed:

1/7 NRT to EWR – 84k (Nonstop, United)

1/9 NRT – LAX - JFK  (AA 35k miles, and 80k if earlier… )

1/7 (Delta 78K miles)

I also looked at Avios, and ANA and found out ANA requires a round trip so it wouldn’t work. The biz 80k is available but they wont let me book one way.
Virgin Atlantic looks promising with 40k miles to Seattle, and I can find my way back from Seattle to EWR.

My biggest issue right now is finding a return trip. Most of the flights I saw wanted about 100k points on that single leg. I'm open to suggestions. Taipei and ICN are optional if there are other paths.

I used Singapore Miles to book flights on United metal. Now, there has been a significant change in flight. Who is responsible in this case? 

I talked to Singapore and they were willing to cancel the ticket for the $30 cancellation charges so I could book another one. Shouldnt they cancel the ticket for free if needed?

Further, upon checking, UA has flight from my airport (IAH) to HNL to OGG (my ultimate destination). Singapore airline said they cant book this ticket as they cant see Hawaii Airline sector (HNL to OGG). Is this correc that SQ cant book those flights?

How much I have to plead with United to rebook me to a better connecting flight? I currently arrive at 9:40pm rather than decent time of 5pm that was originally scheduled.
