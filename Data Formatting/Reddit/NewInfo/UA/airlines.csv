4,UNITED AIRLINES,0,6559pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/6559pg/united_airlines/,12,2017-04-13 16:53:15,"#United #Unitedairlines Seeing that the mainstream media has deluded most of the social media populace, I decided to leave my comments as a person possessing insider information.

Neoliberalism has always been integrated in the bedrock of American society, postmodern or premodern. In any capitalist society, big multinational corporations will always have the final say.

In defense of UA's bumping procedure:
In this case, the passenger dragged down the aircraft refused to comply with the company's terms and conditions. An overseated flight will always result in the bumping procedure if the incentives for vouchers and free accommodation does not offload the adequate number of passengers needed for the staff to be seated, or if no one volunteers to get offboard. An overbooked flight means that passengers will even get to sit on the jump seats (crew seats). If an inadequate number of crew does not go aboard the flight, an immense amount of pressure will be placed upon the crew, rendering the service to be less efficient and degrading quality. 
So, the bumping procedure had to be initiated that flight. Three Caucasians and one Asian were chosen by the computer system to be offloaded. Here's how the algorithm works: Staff-travelers (staffs who are using company privileges to travel at a lower price) will be considered to be offloaded first. Next, the discounted ticket travelers. Then, normal economy class travelers. Then, business class travelers (RARELY), etc. As I suppose you should understand it now:
Lower priority (paid less) travelers will be bumped first. YOU PAY LESS, YOU HAVE LESSER PASSENGER RIGHTS. (The first rule of capitalism for major travelling companies, and they abide to this business model.)
THERE WAS NO RACISM.

Justifications of the incident, pro-passenger and pro-company:
Social media news outlets did not go behind the scenes, and spread disinformation. Let's do a fact-check, shall we?
1. 4 passengers chosen by RANDOM?
No. Algorithms for business. (See last paragraph)

2. ONLY United Airlines bump passengers.
No. Major airlines do so as part of their marketing technique. Air Canada, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, etc. do so.

3. BLATANT RACISM BIGOTRY!
...And the race card has to be pulled by far-left social justice warriors. United Airlines as an airline company has employed most diverse races as employees, and has treated them all fairly, regardless of race. There are Asian employees who like the company because the CEO hates racism and treats them fairly, having no wage and privilege gap between nationalities. Wake up. It’s a globalized company.

4. Achieving the middle ground:
The video footage is incomplete, as it only showed the man being dragged out. What happened before was that the man was asked by airport police/security to be bumped, which he refused to comply, therefore committing a federal offense according American law (breaking a major homeland security law), and was being disruptive to the peaceful atmosphere by waving his fists. Therefore, the security had to forcefully drag him out. He was acting in a passive-aggressive manner for the public to sympathize with him.
Who's to blame? (NOT in an order of importance)
1. The ground staff
The bumping procedure should start before the passengers are seated: the fault lies at the ground staff, as they should notify the cabin crew beforehand, before the flight has boarded passengers.

2. The airport security officer
The officer wasn't a UA employee. Then, police brutality in the US. 'Nuff explained. Always happens lol

3. The passenger
Before buying the ticket he should read the rules of the airline, that the bumping procedure would be initiated if necessary. He refused to cooperate with staff and exacerbated the situation by throwing a tantrum, and hurt himself during the process.

As the incident has sparked outrage and distress in the public mainly due to the brutality, the biggest fault perhaps lies at the POLICE OFFICER. However, the public only cares about what triggered it (UA offloading passengers), and the misconception of the security being a part of their airline company, so they blame the company, despite the company never stated to ‘beat the customer until he abides’. United did not break any law, and he agreed to the policy and possibility of involuntary bump when he bought his ticket. They followed protocol as required by law. Once law enforcement became involved (also as required by federal protocol), United stepped out of the decision-making process. They had nothing to do with the rest. The passenger was forcibly removed by federal aviation security (the disturbing clip that everyone is talking about) after running back into the secured area after being escorted out once. Once he did that, like it or not, they (law enforcement) were under full discretion of the law to apply necessary force to remove the threat. I’m not saying it’s pretty, but the only one who actually broke a law was the passenger. 

A little fact:
UA stocks have only dropped 1%. 1 billion was lost yesterday, but today it had risen 800 million, therefore compensating the 2% yesterday.

The moral of the story is that when you take advantage of the service the airport provides, you play by their rules.

To the people who wants to boycott or/and wishes UA to be bankrupt due to this incident: You are deluded by social media. Think twice before jumping to conclusions and doing something irrational. "

Personally, I'd go United.",4,665x1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/665x1a/virgin_america_or_united_personally_id_go_united/,6,2017-04-19 01:40:48,"This airline is stunningly bad. Seriously, give United your money before these people. Worst policies and customer service I have ever encountered.

I had something unexpected come up and was forced to cancel my flight. I canceled SEVEN WEEKS before my scheduled departure. There was a $150 cancellation fee, which was brutal but understandable. On the page it does the calculation for you, informing me that after the cancellation fee I would be left with a $170 refund. I wasn't in love with it, but I didn't really have a choice. I clicked cancel.
Next day I check my email, and see that the $170 is not paid in cash, but in VA flight credit. What? For the $150 cancellation fee they couldn't even do me the courtesy of giving me the rest of my overpriced ticket price refunded in cash. That important detail was hidden in a morass of microscopic font on a different page. 

So I'm stuck holding $170 in flight credit. This is a problem, because where am I going to fly to? They have like six locations, and two are in Hawaii. To recap, VA gets $150 free and clear, they have seven weeks to fill that seat, and I the consumer am left with $170 of flight credit for an airline that has direct flights to a handful of locations, and if you don't happen to need to go directly to/from those places they charge a truly exorbitant amount for connections (hence my heinously overpriced $330 domestic one-way from JFK to Denver).

So that means I have to basically force a flight somewhere as a grad student to some place I don't need to go in the next 18 months, because that's the other catch -- in the email you get about your new ""Elevate"" flight credit, they cheerfully inform you that your points never expire... as long as you make some kind of transaction every 18 months. Well unless you're a business flyer, it's gonna be pretty tough to use those points every 18 months. I sure am not going to be able to find a way to force a flight to some random location in the next 18 months as a grad student with only $170 credit.

And this really sums up the entire VA experience. Throughout my hours-long conversations with customer service, I was reminded again and again that this was the policy, and I should have read it. Yes, I should have. Clearly. But time and again, whenever I made any decision on VA's website or in their emails, the visible information was always INCREDIBLY misleading. The Terms and Conditions are down at the bottom somewhere, a light gray link in size 4 font on a slightly darker gray background, and the reason they do everything in their power to hide the Terms and Conditions is because they are toxic. They are the least consumer-friendly policies of any company I have ever dealt with ever. 

So, if you have a very precise route and time in mind and you are 100% confident nothing will happen to disrupt that, and the sloppy constellation of oddball locations happens to line up for you, I guess VA isn't your worst bet. But if you have even the SLIGHTEST worry that something might come up, or that you might have to deal with these people for ANY reason, run. Run as far and as fast as you possibly can.

----------------------------------
2014 January - flight from Las Vegas to Houston cancelled because of ""Technical Problems"". Given accommodation in one of the nearby motels. Sure, shit can happen. But we were already sitting on the flight when we were told this. And then we had to wait in the rebooking line for more than 1 hour.

2014 July - United flight from IAH to Frankfurt. Gate agent would not let me in on the flight although I have a valid US immigration status and passport. Interestingly, my wife and child travelled the same route two weeks ago on UNITED. Rebooked for 2 days later because flights are fully booked the next day. They rebooked it but made a mistake in the connection. My connecting flight was scheduled to leave 1 day before I reach Delhi. Lots of trouble at Delhi airport as United offices are closed during the day.

2014 December - Sister in law coming from Delhi to Houston. Flight delayed by 1 day because of (you guessed it) ""Technical Problems"". Provided accommodation but given no information on when the next flight is due.

2015 January - Same Sister in law going back to India on United Flight. This time United lost the luggage. And now they are giving us the run around. One of the excuses was - your check in contains liquids. So we cannot ship it....

These people impersonated as being united airlines and suckered me into giving them my credit card information and said it was the last flight and seat available. STUPID ON MY PART!!!!!!

Got on the phone with LEGIT UNITED AIRLINES COMPANY they told me the company should not have charged me a fee because the FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED and IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FREE!!  They also said that through united airlines there were no transactions of $75 US (WHICH THIS BS OF A COMPANY CHARGED ME). Therefore, this company took the information I gave them impersonated me to change the flight. Then this FRAUDULENT COMPANY proceeded to charge me for NO REASON. THEY CLAIMED IT WAS UNITED AIRLINES, IT WASN'T.

When I asked the united airline agent if this was the last flight and seat available. THEY SAID NO THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SEATS AVAILABLE. what a SHOCKER... another lie AGAIN.  I then told united airlines that since this FRAUDULENT company has my infromation can they please make sure no changes are made to this flight. They agreed and advised me to contact my bank (already did that).

I had called this FAKE BS OF A COMPANY before I contacted the legit United airline company. The customer service was so bad at FAREKINGDOM.

**By December 2018**, Etihad Airways will have **retrofitted its 10 Airbus A380s with Economy Space seats**, which feature an **increased seat pitch of up to 36 inches.** The redesign increases the number of extra **legroom seats** in Economy **from 20 to 80 on this aircraft type**.

Jamal Ahmed Al Awadhi, Etihad Airways Head of Guest Experience, said: “We recognise that no two travellers are alike, and today’s customers demand more choice and personalisation during their travels.

In response to the popularity and demand for extra legroom seats, we have reconfigured our Economy cabin to allow travellers to enhance their overall travel experience.”

In addition to modifying its A380s, Etihad Airways will have also added **additional Economy Space seats to 12 Boeing 777s and 21 Boeing 787 Dreamliners by the end of 2019,** increasing the total number of extra legroom seats by 560 per cent.

“While many airlines have been squeezing more seats into economy class, we continue to focus on providing our guests with exceptional products and services that meet and exceed the demands and budgets of different types of travellers,” adds Mr. Al Awadhi.

**Families with small children, elderly travellers and that requiring wheelchair** assistance can now **purchase and benefit** from the **extra available room available in Economy Space**.

Economy Space complements Etihad Airways’ existing ancillary products to provide customers with greater opportunities to personalise their journey, including the Neighbour-free seating option in Economy and a range of ‘buy-on-board’ products.

Irrespective of which seating option is selected, customers will continue to receive the Etihad’s complimentary core dining service and inflight entertainment."

I just flew using United Airlines (not really important I guess, cause TSA was my issue). I traveled with my PS4, as I was just coming back from a 3 month trip. I always put my PS4 in the original box with all original packaging, etc... and put it in a hard sided suitcase. Well, when I got home, I saw the dreaded TSA inspection slip inside my bag. My PS4 wasn't properly back in the box and some other items were shoved in the box with it. The case is now cracked and the power button was broken off. It still works, but you have to turn it on with the controller or a paperclip (to hit the power button on the board). Is there anything I can do? I tried calling the number on the slip, but was on hold for 45 minutes. I don't want to waste time on the phone if it'll amount to nothing.

TLDR: TSA broke my PS4. Is there anything I can do?"

This time last year I booked a ticket with United airlines. But I wasn't able to use it.
So they said that they'd give me the credit and I could use it within a year.
I'd like to use it now for a different flight.

I have $309 in credit and the new ticket is $319.
But they say that I have to pay the difference, which is $10. And with it another $200, which they say is the cancellation fee.

I can't afford to pay the $200 but I really do need to use the flight to go visit my family.

Do I have an option where I wouldn't have to pay the cancellation fee? Or did I lose the $309?

Thanks,

P.s. For the cancelled flight, I was supposed to go to Louisiana. Now I'd like to use it to go to Madison, Wisconsin; if that makes any difference..."
37,Luggage Lost by Vueling Airlines - Airline is refusing to compensate,4,aaqu2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/aaqu2l/luggage_lost_by_vueling_airlines_airline_is/,3,2018-12-30 03:30:35,"tl;dr - My bag was lost during a short flight between Amsterdam and Spain. The airline (Vueling) is refusing to compensate me, because I am missing a ""bag tag"", which was taken from me after my original flight was overbooked. What avenues of recourse do I have?

​

Here's the long of it:

* Back in the summer (July) I flew from Amsterdam to Spain on Vueling Airlines.
* I brought only carry-on luggage, but when I was checking in for my flight, the lady at check in said I needed to check my bag as well. I wasn't thrilled but said ok. My bag got tagged, my boarding pass was printed, and a bag tag was stapled to my boarding pass.
* When I arrived at the gate, I was told the flight was overbooked, and I would have to be rebooked on another flight.
* The gate agent printed new boarding passes for me, and the dozen or so other people who were overbooked. I had to trade in my original ticket (with the bag tag stapled) at this point. The gate agent did not transfer my bag tag to the new ticket.
* When I landed in Spain, my bag did not arrive at baggage claim. It appeared that most of the other overbooked folks had the same story, as half a dozen people from the flight were missing their bag.
* We all waited in line at the baggage claim to file reports. I had a PIR report filed with all the relevant details of my bag including flight number, flight time, original flight, type of bag, etc. I was told the bag would be sent to my hotel the next day, and that I would get 50 Euros per day of spending allowance on necessities until that point.
* The next day, I did not hear from the airport. I went out shopping to buy clothes.
* The 2nd day, I still did not hear. I called the airport, and they said they could ship it to my home in the United States instead, since I was only in Spain until the end of the next day. I agreed.
* I purchased a large backpack so I could carry the clothes I bought home with me.
* When I arrived back in the states, the real frustrations began. Every attempt to call vueling was punted around and ended with some arcane instructions for me, plus being told to wait ""about a month"". I heard all kinds of excuses like ""now is a busy time of year for us"", ""check back in december"", ""wait several weeks"", ""wait a few months"".
* I was told the bag was in Vueling's possession and they would get it to me at some point.
* I requested to be reimbursed for the basic necessities I bought in Spain, and was told to fill out a form with the following documents:
   * PIR Report
   * Bag Tag
   * Passenger's Boarding Pass
   * ID Card / Residence Card / Passport
   * Receipts for money spent on basic necessities
   * A list describing the contents of the bag
* I provided all of these documents, except for the bag tag, which I did not have, due to the gate agent taking it from me when my flight was overbooked.
* After 21 days, I was told the bag was no longer in Vueling's possession and was considered missing.
* I requested to be reimbursed for the bag and its contents.
* Vueling has refused to compensate me for either the basic necessities, or the bag and its contents, citing the missing bag tag as the reason. From their support team:

""Regarding your claim, we regret to inform you that it has not been accepted because you are missing one of the vital documents in order to process claims for compensation.  Unfortunately without the original bag tag we are unable to continue the process. We apologize for any inconvinience \[sic\]""

​

This has been a months-long process, where the airline has let my case sit without response for long periods of time. The onus has always been on me to prod for responses, and to try and push for some kind of compensation. The entire experience has been incredibly arduous. The airline has all of the information they need to compensate me, and have even admitted to losing the bag, yet they rely on a ridiculous policy that requires passengers to retain hard copies of their travel documents in order to refuse claim compensation.

​

I have considered hiring a lawyer, but I am worried the fees for the lawyer will be too high compared to a potential reward. I am also not sure if a U.S. lawyer can make much headway against a Spanish airline.

​

I don't want to let the airline go on this. What actions can I take to make sure they pay up? What is my best course forward?"
38,Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it...,4,7ac8ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7ac8ox/could_us_legacy_carriers_bring_back_domestic_3/,3,2017-11-02 19:26:46,"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?"
39,UPDATE - Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me and Delta Delayed My Bag,0,435b3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/435b3a/update_virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_and/,3,2016-01-28 23:58:40,"**UPDATE**

I have an update regarding my situation as [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/)

After advice from the comments, I haven't contacted Virgin Atlantic yet knowing that I have a weaker case against them.

However, Delta's claim officer called me couple days ago and said that since my flight plan was cancelled by Virgin Atlantic, it's not Delta's fault that they delayed my bags for over a week, so they won't reimburse me anything.

Here's the story about the lost baggage. Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. The whole experience has been super expensive and frustrating for me.

**December 14th, 7 AM** - I flew from PHL to JFK in Delta. 

**8 AM** - I landed in JFK. I was at the Virgin Atlantic's boarding gate for about 45 minutes trying to figure out my travel situation. The VA agents at the boarding gate told me that my bag has been pulled out of the plane and I can collect it from Delta's baggage claim.

**8:45 AM** - When I went downstairs to the baggage claim, I couldn't find my bag. I spoke to Delta agents and they said that *""yes, your bag was pulled out of the plane, but one of our staff made a mistake and put it back on the queue. But your bag is still in the JFK airport. We will have baggage handling guys pull it out from the queue and bring it back here. You can come back after 30-40 minutes to pick it up.""*

**9:00 - 9:30 AM** - I used those 30 minutes to step out to the lounge area and figure out the rest of the trip. I finally booked my tickets with United and made travel arrangements to go to EWR from JFK (neither VA nor Delta helped me here, off course).

**9:30 - 4 PM** - When I came back after 30 minutes, I found my bag was still missing. I checked again - and they said, they are having someone bring my bag to me and asked me to just wait. Now, this is almost 10 AM. I spent next 6+ hours at the airport in the baggage claim area trying to figure out where my bag was. Delta kept changing their story from *""Wait for few minutes""* to *""It's Virgin Atlantic's fault, talk to them""* (spoke to Virgin Atlantic staff but she didn't even bother to look into their system to find my bag), to finally Delta acknowledging, *""Sorry, we can't find your bag, but we know it's in JFK""*. Delta's baggage claim supervisor tried to find my bag in the system. He said the last time my bag was in Delta's system was at 10:30 AM in one of the racks but when he called a staff in the racks area to retrieve my bag, it was not there. And they don't know where my bag is.

**4 PM** - My flight to United was at 8 PM, but I still needed to take a bus to EWR, do security check up again and figure out if they were also going to refuse to board me. Delta's baggage supervisor said *""sorry we messed up""* many times. They acknowledged that it was their own staff who mistakenly put my bag in the queue AFTER it was pulled out from the VA plane. The supervisor asked me to fill out the claim information. I wrote down my Indian (Delhi) address and Indian phone number, and the supervisor said ""we will deliver your bag to your doorstep in Delhi in a couple days"". I got a tracking number and the supervisor told me to track my bag on www.delta.com/trackbag

**4:30 PM** - I leave for EWR. No issues while boarding there.

**December 15th 10 PM (Indian Time)** - I land in Delhi.  I check delta.com/trackbag. I see that the bag is on a KLM flight (Delta's partner) and is in Amsterdam. And it is scheduled to arrive in Delhi on December 16th. 

**December 16th** - I check delta.com/trackbag - no update in status. I spend entire day at my address to make sure I don't miss the delivery. I called Delta, gave them my tracking ID and my baggage tag number - they couldn't find any information about my bag. Asked me to call back next day when they have more information. Delta's 999 Baggage Assistance emailed me saying the same - they have no information but they are trying to find it. I have that email as a record.

**December 17th** - I check the website - still no updates. I called Delta again, they acknowledge that the bag was enroute to DEL through Amsterdam, but they have no current information. Asked me to give them one more day. Email asked for more details, but didn't provide any idea about what happened to my bag. 

**December 18th (Friday)** - I check the website - still no updates. I call Delta - they had no new information for me. They don't know where my bag is. At 4 PM (1 hour before the airline luggage counters close), I simply drove to the DEL airport. Walked up to the KLM luggage counter at the airport. Found my bag sitting there among a pile of other lost and found bags. The staff there asked me to sign my name before allowing me to take the bag home with me. 

**December 19th (Saturday India Time/Friday EST)** - Received an email from Delta - they still have no clue where my bag is. I told them that I found my bag.

**Fast Forward - last week** - Delta sent an email saying that they were sorry for the delay in my bag and that I would be eligible for any purchases I made during this time. Asked me to send them receipts, which I did.

**Couple days ago** - The Delta claim agent called, asked me to tell her why I got out at JFK. I just mentioned *""I didn't have the right documents for Virgin Atlantic, so needed a different flight""*. And before I could even further explain the rest of the story, she just cut me off and said *""sorry, that's not a Delta problem. We are not liable for delay in your bag if you change plans. You are not eligible for any claim. Bye.""*

So there's where I am right now. I paid a huge price for my one mistake of not checking the transit visa requirements. But tell me, what's the Delta's price for being just incompetent? "

I frankly don't plan to fly on United if at all possible, but I suppose I might from time to time.

&#x200B;

I believe the flight pattern I am describing unfortunately won't ever result in me being upgraded to a higher frequent flyer status level, but I do want to accrue points that I can spend on flights, etc.  Is anyone familiar with the frequent flyer programs of ANA, EVA, and United, and how their systems work together?  Am I better off sticking with a single frequent flyer program and using it when I fly on any of these airlines, or should I sign up for all three and use whichever one I happen to be flying with?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!"
42,Airlines Accountability...You listening American?,0,3026si,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/3026si/airlines_accountabilityyou_listening_american/,2,2015-03-24 01:43:30,"Often times we find ourselves looking at an airline commercial showing a smiling pilot or flight attendant flying us to beautiful destinations, business meetings, and family gatherings.  They make it seem like a joyful occasion to get on one of their brand new airplanes and take off traveling.  There is another side to this entire story.  It’s a side that only people who fly just as much as me can tell.  

I am an engineer and fly pretty much every week.  I fly so much that my girlfriend says ‘thank you for visiting’ every Sunday while I am packing for my next trip Monday morning.  Flying a lot does have its benefits and privileges like being one of the first to be upgraded to first class when available, or going through faster lines at checkpoints.  Even with all the privileges that I do have they don’t compare to the days sitting at the airport all day long waiting for my flights that are getting delayed, cancelled, or moved to twenty different gates; today is one of those days. 

The weather is terrible in Chicago IL on March, 15th, 2015.  I woke up thinking we would have spring weather and I truly feel like we are back in January.  Even though my 7:35 flight to Texas is on time it’s a two hour car ride to the airport.  Sure enough I miss my flight.  I probably wouldn’t miss it if American Airlines would update their online system before 7:20am showing that the flight is still there.  As I pull up to O’Hare International Airport I am on the phone with American Airlines and lucky for me there is another flight to Texas.  I am rebooked in less than twenty minutes.  As I step out of my cab I look at the screen and sure enough my flight that I was just booked on is cancelled.  I call the people I was planning to meet and tell them to go ahead without me.  My next flight out of Austin was supposed to go to Denver where I would spend until Friday before I go home again.  I decide to go straight to Denver from Chicago.

As I approach the gate I ask for an upgrade and sure enough I get a first class seat.  Cool right? NO!  We spend 35 minutes getting deiced, 30 minutes wondering why we are not moving, 30 minutes waiting for the mechanic to get on the plane because the pilot notified us there may be something wrong, 15 minutes waiting for the mechanic to tell us he is grounding the flight, and another 20 minutes for American Airlines to tell us that they don’t have any other plane to give us and that we must deplane.  How long was that?  Lets count (30+30+15+20)=1 hour and 35 minutes sitting on the plane without any movement.  First class did get some juice. YEY!

The rebooking nightmare begins as we all scramble to the gate agent who is looking at us like vultures.  With all my status exemptions, bla, bla, bla, I get a 9:15pm departure.  Its now close to 1:30PM.  Yikes!!!  Good news is that there is another flight out at 3:15pm and I am 2nd on standby.  

We live in a world of internet so I open up my Kyak app around 2:30pm and realize that they five seats available on United Airlines.  I call my most amazing Platinum Advantage Desk.  Sounds fancy, right?  NO!  They tell me they cannot put me on this flight because their system is showing 0 seats available.  I decide to call my company’s booking agency and sure enough I was right.  There ARE seats available.  I call Advantage Platinum Desk again and ask for a supervisor.  Gloria Garcia, a very condescending supervisor is telling me no way will she put me on that flight.  

I tried calling the customer relations department but all I get is a very lengthy voicemail of some hotshot explaining to use the web services.  I decided to write a complaint still.

Besides trying to kill time and blow off some steam, there is a point to all of this nonsense.  Accountability.  There is none!!!  Airlines like American Air keep people in the dark, which gets people frustrated and confused.  I missed two important meetings today and my job was on the line.  Knowing all this American Platinum Desk still did not want to help their Platinum member, a member who buys tickets every week two at least two or more destinations.  I am truly disappointed.   What could they have done?  Instead of giving me a juice cup they could have taken my schedule seriously and considered that there might have been a reason I woke up today at 5am to catch my 7:35am flight.  They might have figured something out.  To them, it’s a business and I get it.  But I as a customer bring them this business.  Its pitiful that they had me stoop so low as to write this.

A few days ago, I purchased tickets from LAX to NRT for $488. An amazing deal that was only better when I found out the flying airline would be ANA. But to purchase at that price, I had to buy the ticket through United that codeshares that flight with ANA. 

Here is my concern. Out of the 2, I would of gone with ANA hands down. If There is a time change, can United if they want change that codeshare flight from ANA to their own fleet and fly it like that, or are they bound to use ANA? Normally codeshare flights I don't mind, but I would prepare the hospitality and food service with ANA rather then United. "

Which airline would you say has the best app?  I only have the big three US based ones (because I fly those more regularly—the airline varies with international travel) and I would say Delta, hands down.  I like how easy it is to see PQMs and PQDs for the trip right on the app, plus the ease of tracking checked bags.  I really find everything about the user interface appealing.

There are some nice things United and AA have on their apps that Delta doesn’t, but overall, they’ve got my vote."

Thank you for your reply, but i'm less than satisfied with your compensation offer of 300$. United Airlines offered 700$ to anyone who was willing to fly stand by on march 19th. As I wrote in my complaint, my brother and I  had important exams and had to work, we were not voluntary on stand by...Honestly , I was expecting the same or a better compensation than anyone who wanted to leave their seats voluntary. The glitch in the system wasn't our fault and be expect United Airline to compensate us in a respectful way.

I can certainly understand how upsetting this was as it disrupted your travel plans. Keeping safety our top priority, we work closely with Air Traffic Control (ATC) to determine the best possible flight path and departure times.
 
 
I'm very sorry to read about the confusion at the airport about your return ticket.
 
I can only imagine how this made you feel. We never intended for your ticket to be canceled. I'll make sure to pass along your feedback so our airports can focus on improving our process. As a way to show we appreciate your patience, I'm sending each of you an Electronic Travel Certificate, which can be used on a future United Airlines or United Express flight. It should arrive via email in the next few business days.
 
We take issues regarding safety and security very seriously. The concerns about how we handled your ticket are understandable. While we do ensure our passenger count matches before departure, there may have been a technology glitch which canceled your return ticket. I do understand, though, as we should have been ready for you when you arrived at the airport. Your time is important. We'll work on getting better at the recovery process.
 
Montreal Convention covers actual provable damages caused by a controllable. Please send me receipts for reimbursement consideration.
 
Your request for a refund is respectfully denied as we do not refund used tickets.
 
Thank you for your business and loyalty to United Airlines. We look forward to serving you on board a future flight.
 
 
Regards,
 
Melinda Collins

Laval, March 25th 2017
 
My name is X and I’m writing this formal complaint to the person in charge of customer incl. cc legal and eservice. On February 23th, I paid 1324,90$ for 2 people(My brother, X and myself)to go to Mexico City for 6 days (March 13th to March 19th). We chose to pay more to be back on the Sunday since we both go to school and have jobs. Our problems started on March the 13th, when we arrived at the Montreal Airport (YUL), we learned that our flight (UA8481) was cancelled to Chicago due to weather. After an hour of questioning and asking United Airlines members for a solution, we finally got transferred for a flight going trough Toronto by Air Canada. We finally arrived to Mexico City, 2 hours later than our initial arrival time with flight (UA1547).
 
On March 19th 2017, we showed up at 9h30 am at the MEX airport for our flight back to Montreal. As we check in at the counter, we are told in Spanish that there is a problem with our reservation. For 15 minutes, the lady at the counter couldn’t answer any of our questions since she spoke no English. Finally, the team leader named Diana came to us and told us that the system cancelled our tickets for the flights UA1066 and UA4026! When asked why, she couldn’t give us a clear answer and said that there was probably a glitch in the system. When we asked her what the solution was, she couldn’t provide us with any solution. She offered to reserve two seats to go to Newark, USA, but after that, she had no idea what’s next or how we get to Montreal (final destination). She suggested we would call someone to pick us up in Newark, which is more than 600 miles away in a another country. We asked her to check with other airlines for a flight to Montreal but she said that she wasn’t allowed to do so. During the whole process, we are calling our parents who are panicking because their 20 and 24 years old are stuck in Mexico without any money or hotel. Our parents are able to see online some flights that we could board on time, but the lady at the counter advised us that if we book them, we probably won’t get a full refund from United Airlines. We stayed at the counter for more than an hour without any suggestion from United Airlines staff. The team leader finally suggested that we take the flight from Newark on the next morning (UA3938) and that we could be standby for the flight in the evening. We finally boarded the flight to Newark without any winter apparels. Once in Newark, we have trouble going trough the border control since we don’t have any hotel or seats for a flight. We were questioned for more than 20 minutes because of the situation. We finally arrived at United Airline’s counter to print our boarding passes and once again, we have to tell our whole story because United Airlines didn’t document any information. We go to our gate to wait and see if we can make it but the flight is overbooked. We can hear staff offering a 700$ voucher, a night in a hotel and meals for anyone who is volunteering to fly on the next day.
 
It’s now 21h30 and we still didn’t have any meals since 10 am and we didn’t get any vouchers to eat. The plane left without us and we are now stuck in another country without any information. We go to the United Airline counter and we are shocked to see that we have to retell our story since nothing was documented again, even if it was told an hour before in the same airport. The lady at the counter named “Shamonette” explains us that we cant have a hotel or any vouchers since she doesn’t understand what happened to our initial reservation. We asked to speak to a manager named Robert and after half an hour of asking, we are told we will have a hotel room. We are advised that there is only one bed in the room, and I
had to beg to get a 2nd bed since sleeping with my adult brother wasn’t an option. We then get a 10$ coupon for food in the airport, this 10$ is suppose to cover 2 meals. I had to literally beg to get a second coupon for a breakfast since we didn’t have any American money. They offered to check in our bags for free to excuse this trouble. We finally go outside in the freezing weather to wait for a shuttle for the hotel, we had to wait 40 minutes outside. We arrived at the hotel at 23h00 and we were told that we have to take a bus at 5h00 am for our flight. After a very short night (we had to sleep in our bathing suits since we had no clean clothes), we arrived at the airport and we went to check in our bags but we are asked to pay the 25$. For the fourth time, we have to retell our story and the lady at the counter goes to ask her manager. The manager accepts, but asked to keep our old boarding passes. We asked him to do some copies since we were planning to document the whole incident and it took 10 minutes for him to finally accept to copy our boarding passes. We landed in Montreal at 10 am, more than 12 hours later than our original arrival time.
 
 
 
For all the issues mentioned above I believe it is not only against the Montreal Convention, but the United Airline convention, and believe we should be refunded and compensated.

My dad and i were supposed to take a connecting flight from denver to fl. Lauderdale, however our first flight got delayed, so we missed our 2nd connecting flight to ft. Lauderale. Customer service gave us food/hotel vouchers for the night and assigned us the next flight tomorrow morning at 8ish. However when we arrived at the terminal, we saw our flight got canceled, so we went to customer service again regarding our situation. We managed to get new booking tickets for departure 5 hours later. So we just have to wait 5 more hours. In the midst of this, i asked last night at customer service and today regarding our checked bags back in LAX by asking if we had to notify someone or have to claim our bags and go through the process again by checking them in. Both said our bags should automatically transfer over to our next flight and we didnt have to anything on our hands. Meaning our bags will arrive at the destination the same time as we arrived to ft. Lauderdale. Has anyone experienced this similar sitaution? I just want to be sure and i dont want to deal with having issue at ft  lauderdale airport with no checked bags arriving there.

47,Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me After Flying Me From PHL to JFK and Refused to Refund My Money - What to do?,1,42hdq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/,2,2016-01-24 22:49:28,"Dear Redditors, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this question. 

I am just looking what's the best thing for me to do and some advice on how to proceed on this nightmare that I faced last month. Also, is there any hope to get any percentage of money refunded - either for departure or return tickets.

**Here's the story (sorry it’s long):**
Couple months ago, I bought a round trip ticket for last month from PHL to DEL (New Delhi, India) on Virgin Atlantic last month. The connecting flights were from PHL to JFK (with Delta - partnering with Virgin Atlantic), JFK to LHR (with Virgin Atlantic), and LHR to DEL (Virgin Atlantic). 

This was my first time flying with Virgin Atlantic. And here was my US Visa situation - I had an expired H1-B visa and I was flying to India to get the Visa renewed. Actually, the visa was already renewed by my employer, so I just need a new Visa stamp in an US consulate, which can only be done outside the US. I confirmed with a Virgin Atlantic customer service agent before flying that my Visa situation would not be an issue on the date of flying.

On the date of the flight, the Delta staff at PHL boarded me to JFK. Once I landed in JFK, the Virgin Atlantic staff at the JFK boarding gate refused to board me. They mentioned that I did not have an UK issued transit visa required for me to go through LHR. What bothered me most is that the staff there looked at all of my documents - my passport, current and expired visa documents - and falsely (I will explain why falsely later) claimed that I do not even have the right Visa documents for United States. They said “You do not have an US Visa or proper documents, you cannot leave this country and fly anywhere”. In reality, I actually did have all the paper work that I needed to leave the country, go to India, get my visa stamped at an US consulate, and then return back. 

I have been in United States for last 14 years, and this was the worst example of customer service I had ever experienced in my life. The staff were extremely rude, condescending, simply refused to help me, or find me another Virgin Atlantic flight that goes through other routes to DEL. 

When I called Virgin Atlantic customer service for further help, the staff on the phone couldn’t also help me with other routes. They had already flew me from PHL to JFK, so now I am stuck in the middle of my journey in an airport far from my home (Philly) without any help from Virgin Atlantic. If this were still in Philly, I could have just driven home and planned  something better. 

I called the customer service again - this time to cancel the remainder of my journey and they said that I needed to pay $200 more to cancel the remaining trip. I asked if I get a travel voucher instead - and they said that would also cost my additional money ($200+ more). When I asked if I can get a refund, they said the tickets are non-refundable and I needed to talk to my travel agent. I put Virgin Atlantic staff and my travel agent representative on a conference call. Essentially, the travel agent mentioned that the money is already processed by Virgin Atlantic, so VA needs to refund it. And Virgin Atlantic staff refused to proceed with any refund.

Finally, I had to purchase another direct flight on a different airlines (United) from a different airport (EWR) which cost me an arm and a leg. The tickets I bought for Virgin Atlantic were simply a waste since I could neither use them nor get any money for refund. 

In addition to all that, Delta lost my checked in luggage when I flew from PHL to JFK and they couldn’t find my bag in JFK airport. It took them more than 10 days to find my bag (well, more like after repeatedly calling them and trying to identify the location of my bag and unable to get any response from them, I simply drove to the airport in DEL, and found my bag lying near their airport counter, unattended).

Given the terrible experience with Virgin Atlantic, I did not take the return flight with them - so those return tickets were also wasted.

The United flight was a direct flight from EWR to DEL - the staff there did not have any issues with my documentations. And in the US Embassy in New Delhi, I got my Visa stamped instantly - the embassy staff there mentioned that I have been in US for long enough and I had all the right documentations for me to get it instantly approved - contradicting Virgin Atlantic boarding gate staff’s theory that I did not have the right US Visa documentations and hence their ground for refusal to board me. 

**tl;dr** - Virgin Atlantic (in partnership with Delta) flew me from PHL to JFK, before refusing to board me at JFK. Then they refused to refund my money and Delta misplaced my baggage for more than a week.

After several bad experiences, I gave up. I willingly pay a couple hundred dollars extra and take a less convenient route just to not have to up with United's lousy customer service.

Being a Mileage Plus member, I still get random emails from them. Sometime within the last year, there was an email from the company the saying they had a new either president or CEO and they were going to work hard to improve customer satisfaction.

Has anyone flown with United in the last year or so? Has their dismal customer service improved? Should I try them again?"

It is me, my wife and my 7 Months old infant son traveling. 

Travel agent has issued me 3 separate tickets with same airline confirmation number. In the ticket for my son it shows NO SEAT as he is going to lap baby.

Now when I put the confirmation number on the United website and go to manage my booking and select seats and such, it doesn't reflect my son's name anywhere. Even the total amount of the ticket price it shows on website is what my and wife's ticket price is and my son's ticket price (10% of full fare) doesn't show up at all.

I am very concerned as to why this is happening. I have talked to my travel agent and he said he will get back to me.

Does anyone know ?"

This morning I was supposed to be on a 6am flight from Albuquerque to Portland OR with a connection in San Francisco, all through United. I missed my boarding time and the best they could do for me was getting me to Portland at 8:47pm with a connection to Denver at 6:20 pm. Getting me there with a different itinerary would cost me upwards of $1000 and would only get me there 2 hours earlier.

However, there is a non-stop Southwest from Denver to Portland that I could make costing about $400 and it would get me there at 3pm which is much preferable.. I have no checked bags and it's a one way flight.

I know airlines penalize for purposely missing connections so I'm wondering if this is a no no. I'm not trying to con them, they just can't get me where I need to be fast enough. I was going to ask them but it seems all the United employees decide to vanish at the same time."
53,JetBlue: We Are Raising Fares And Fees!,1,9qwgx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/9qwgx9/jetblue_we_are_raising_fares_and_fees/,2,2018-10-24 08:12:09,"“We’re raising fares and fees because our fuel bill is sky high and travel demand is strong”

JetBlue Airways confirmed what anyone who has shopped for airlines tickets lately already knew: the airline, like its competitors, has been aggressively raising fares to offset sharply higher fuel costs. 

Airlines executives are often reluctant, at least publicly, to admit that tickets prices are on the rise, using industry jargon like “improving yields” to talk about the fare climate.

St. George said jet blue led “several” successful industry fare increases in the July- September quarter and also led the industry’s baggage fees higher.

In late August, JetBlue became the first major airlines to hike baggage fees. The new charges will be $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for second checked bag, up from $25 and $ 30. Alaska airline’s bag fees are due to increase in December. 

Airlines are able to pass along fuel costs because travel demand is strong from business travelers and vacations. On united airlines’ quarterly conference call last week, President Scott Kirby, called it “one of the best revenue environments we’ve ever seen.”"

Alaska will charge $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for the second, in line with new prices at JetBlue, American, Delta and United, according to a new fee chart on its website. JetBlue set $30 and $40 as the new industry benchmark when it hiked its fee in August.

Alaska passenger face a bigger increase in the charge for a second bag than passenger on other airlines because Alaska has been charging $25 for the second checked bag, compared with $35 before the increase as other carriers.

Alaska is also increasing the price for a third checked bag, to $100 from $75. That is still below the $150 fee charged by American, United and delta.

Overpacking will cost Alaska passengers more, too. The airline increased the fee for an overweight bag to $ 100 from $75. All bag fees are each way, per person.

She let me know that she just found out that today is her 30th anniversary with United. I asked if they did anything for her. She told me no. I asked how she found out. I thought at least a manager of some sort had come up and congratulated her on her 30 years with the company. She said that she only found out through payroll. Since the company merged it seems that they do not really seem to care. So I thought, this should not stand. I cannot make the airline recognize her service and devotion to the company that she once loved. But maybe I can do something. My mother has long loved the old United posters for Hawaii, I was thinking I could get one of the posters that she does not own yet. But I thought, that's not enough. I wanted to maybe find someone who can sign the poster for her. Since Walter Varney (founder of United) died in my mothers home town of Santa Barbara back in 1968 and could not find out much more info on any founders I was running out of ideas. But then, I came across an article on Ron Akana. This guy is the oldest living flight attendant and has flown with United for over 60 years! He is also from Hawaii and I figured this guy would be great! But then I hit a snag. I cannot find any contact info for this fine gentleman. This is where I hope that you guys all come in. Anyone know where I can get a hold of him? Contact email or a publicist? Also, any other ideas on people I may be able to contact to try and get an epic signature for my mom for her 30 years of service.

Thanks in advance."

My dad and brother traveled from US (DAY) to India (BOM) via United Airlines. Dayton is a rather small airport and their connection was DAY-EWR-ZRH-BOM. It had United and Swiss flights but it was all though same itinerary. 


They had checked in their baggage in DAY and picked up directly in BOM. There was no need to pick up in EWR. I was of the opinion that they will need to pickup in EWR and put the luggage in next belt for the international flight. I double confirmed with United staff at Dayton and they said no need to do that. But when we enter the US, we usually have to pickup luggage at first entry airport and then take it to next belt for the domestic flight.


So my main question is whether I will always need to NOT PICKUP my luggage within US and will it be through checked in all the way to my final destination ALWAYS ?


My wife and small kid are traveling so I need to know this before I can buy their tickets. "

Now here’s why, May 31’st 2014 I booked myself a flight from SNA “John Wayne” to SEA “Seattle” for October 3rd 2014 along with this so called “insurance”. Why I booked this flight was due to an event I am attending and I thought it was a great deal “at the time”. A month had past and some information was given to me by my peers informing me I should switch the fight to October 2nd and be there a day early as I am needed this day. Well immediately I contact United and was informed of their terrible policy in changing flights with all their outrageous fee’s and fare changes. I was informed to contact the insurance company as they should be able to handle this for me. Well this insurance company had no connection with United and had failed to mention that it is only for the event of an illness or unexpected emergency “would be nice if they provided this in details (not just in the fine print) before purchasing”. So I contact United again “mind you this is still about 3 months or more ago” and asked what my options where. I was told I can call 24 hours before the flight and pay a flat fee of 75.00 dollars to switch fights under same day. I thought ok I can do this but to protect myself I continued to search other flights and found JetBlue had a non-stop from Long beach to Seattle for 100.00 bucks. How could I say no right? So I contacted United again to verify and was informed by a second person that yes that’s correct. 24 hour same day is a flat 75.00 dollars. So I clearly said ok I will just do that option. The months have now past and one week ago September 26th 2014 I contacted United again to verify that this really is happening and I could be changing my flight 24 hours in advanced to the exact same flight a day prior “well 26 hours to be exact” and was informed “YES it is 75.00 dollars and I would change it for you now if I could” I was told. I thought awesome this will be fine, I’m only going to spend 75.00 extra and get there a day early. 48 hours before my flight, I call United again to verify and low and behold I’m given the “no sir that is incorrect” “you cannot change your flight for 75.00 dollar’s, you must pay 200.00 change fee plus airfare at 151.00 for a total of 351.00…” Excuse me??? My months and weeks of calling to making sure THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN has HAPPENED. I was in shock so I ask to speak to a manager. Well Mr. Manager gets on the phone and we get to the break down. Well it all gets broken down to that YES you can get that flight for a fee of 75.00 dollars, phew. Well here we are October 2nd 2014. I Call this morning about 30 hours before my flight to verify and am told “YES you will be able to get on the flight for 75.00 dollars bur we can’t do it for you yet” I asked if it’s best for me to do it at the airport and the gentleman informed me that YES that would be best. (26 hours before my flight) I arrive at SNA and go straight to the counter and am greeted by a nice lady, I give her the whole spiel why I’m here and she looks at me confused. I am now told “no, no the 75.00 dollar change fee is only for same day. You will now have to pay a 150.00 dollar change fee and airfare…” WHAT??? Well ladies and gentlemen I am speechless. I would get nothing out of this women as she is typing away and not even looking at me. I request my papers back and call United AGAIN, and finally someone within the States answers. I give the WHOLE run down of what has happened and why I am now at the airport looking like an idiot. I am told by her that (with attitude mind you) “oh your fare doesn’t qualify for the 75.00 dollar change fee, I don’t know why you were being told this...” WAIT WHAT? What am I to do now? I need to get to Seattle like NOW! Here is what my answer was and the option I was given “pay the change fee’s OR WAIT FOR IT… I can pay a 75.00 change fee for a different flight the next day….” WOW I am in shock. Didn’t she just tell me my fare was not allowed for the changed fee but now it is on another flight? Well let’s just say United has done NOTHING for me other than get me to Seattle a few hours earlier by paying a 75.00 change fee… Guys and Gals, I urge you all too please rethink before EVER flight United. They are crooks, liar’s and thieves. No one knows what they are talking about and all they want to do is take your money and provide poor service. 

To the grammar and punctuation police, I am sorry!"

The events took place about 2 years ago.  I recently came across this letter I wrote.  Sometimes an airline does everything right.  (I edited the names just in case leaving them in was inappropriate.  Otherwise, the letter is as it was in it's entirety.)

United Airlines  
 c/o Customer Care  
 RE: Flight 980 IAD-DEN

To whom it may concern,

I would like to request that you read this entire letter. I would also suggest that this letter go up the chain in customer care and make its way to Flight Attendant management. Ideally, the CEO should read it but that might be a silly pipe dream. Here’s an “executive summary” but below that is the full story:

**tl;dr**

· Seating a passenger in need of assistance who had booked a window seat was a cluster  
· The plane was late and further made late by the seating kerfuffle  
· A passenger was very troublesome and demanding  
· Due to storms we were diverted to Albuquerque to refuel so arrived at our destination over two hours late.  
· The plane was packed and there were many children.  
· The flight attendants gave a clinic on how to handle *all* of that.

**The long version**

My family and I were returning from a trip to Ottawa to see our son who is attending university. The flight from YOW to IAD was uneventful. However, upon entering the jetway for IAD to DEN we were met by a gate agent trying to find the person in 9D. Perhaps there was gum on the seat or someone had spilled water and other accommodations were needed. We were glad we weren’t in 9D (We came to find out later that there *wasn’t* a 9D and this gate agent would never find his passenger).

Our relief was short-lived.  When we arrived at our seats (8A, B, and C) there was a family seated there.  They told us they were waiting on *their* seats (10A, B, and C) the isle seat of which was occupied by an elderly and very heavy person. This person had required a wheelchair but had booked a window seat. So, the gate agent parked her in a seemingly random isle seat displacing this family of three and thus displacing us. As a result, we were in the way of the person in 7A who was impatiently trying to get to *her* seat. It was a traffic jam and things were already backed up on the jetway.

After some interesting logic by the gate agent everything sorted and we took our seats.  We in ours, the other family in theirs, and the person who required the wheelchair was given the isle seat at the bulkhead beside a man (READ: saint) whose wife took the window seat that had been left vacant and he the middle seat at the bulkhead.

The next five hours pushed the bounds of incredulity as the passenger who’d displaced everyone created a complete mess around her seat, bothered everyone around her with requests, and constantly called out to and rang for the flight attendants with endless trivialities; even to try to get first class food. It was as if she thought everyone were there to serve just her; the rudeness was astonishing. Now, I do have to say there may have been cognitive decline involved so I can’t completely say with confidence what I perceived was completely accurate. But, we concluded she, with her obvious health issues and possible cognitive decline, should not have been flying alone. Add to that a diversion to Albuquerque due to storms in Denver – which added two hours or more to our travel time – suffice it to say it was a rather unpleasant flight. Or *could* have been.

And yet…

The atmosphere in the cabin was calm. There were several babies and young children on board and *they* were calm. Looking back on the evening, it just feels like the flight went well albeit a little longer and no one ever believed everything *wouldn’t* work out.

This can be 100% attributed to flight attendants Suzanne M, Sally R, Shauna J, and Barbara S.  Many times, they addressed the demands of this tiresome passenger. Even after multiple encounters, they did so with a genuine smile.  Each conducted themselves with professionalism, confidence, and most importantly, grace. They were efficient and kind, gentle and direct. I’m certain they were tired after a long day, but they didn’t show it.

Moreover, when we were diverted, they kept us informed of the status even when “the situation was fluid” and they didn’t have all the information. When they did, they let us know. 

I write this letter to commend them and their abilities. To commend them individually and as the team they were. They essentially gave a clinic on how to be top-level flight attendants who puts safety first but has the skill to address passenger needs and conduct the passenger-based tasks without missing a beat. I don’t know what the internal United rewards offerings are, but they each should get one. A *big* one.

Their conduct and professionalism did more for United’s reputation in our minds than 10 commercials that probably cost millions. I’m not kidding. 

So, please express my gratitude to them and let their management know. They are truly an asset to United. We are just three people but if they do what they did for *many* sets of three, you have a whole customer base that has United top of mind."
