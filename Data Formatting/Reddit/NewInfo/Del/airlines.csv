0,Delta free upgrade?,1,dkjwrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/dkjwrz/delta_free_upgrade/,2,1571608520.0,"2 years ago, I was on a Virgin Atlantic flight from London Heathrow to New York. When I landed in JFK I had a connection on Delta and I was in seat 11A comfort plus. I was booked economy for both flights but on Delta it seems I got upgraded. My connection on delta was an early morning flight and I had a overnight layover. Could that be a reason why and could this happen again?","['Could have been that all the main cabin seats were filled up and they gave the EC+ seat to the person who has an expensive ticket. ie you.', 'Second that, this is generally always the case for upgrades, is the result of overbooking in the economy class (most airlines, though not all of them, sell a few more tickets than what the economy class can fill, we are talking 7-8 more, as statistics show that somebody will not show up at the gate).\n\nKeep in mind that economy plus and travelers who paid more are likely to be upgraded. A lot of people do not realize that because of the same reasons you can get kicked out of a flight if the business and first classes are sold out too']"

Any info is helpful, thank you!","[""I live in MSP and fly on Delta +/- weekly. Here is what is going to happen (in order of my opinion of likelihood):\n\n1) Nothing, DL will operate generally fine. Their connection carriers will suffer a bit but they will have moderate delays and few cancellations,\n\n2) DL will realize things are bad and proactively cancel a anything from an afternoon to a day or two worth of flights, \n\n3) Complete chaos \n\n1 is what usually happens when there is a bid snowstorm at MSP, even when they are big. It all comes down to if  MAC (the airport owner) can keep a runway open. What helps is that the rest of the carriers usually bail (especially if ORD is also hit which impacts UA and AA) which reduces the demand. Even if they don't DL can usually manage. \n\nProblems start when the snow falls too fast for MAC to keep the runway open (or there are visibility issues which aren't that common). If DL sees this coming they will proactively cancel whole banks of flights (DL schedules flights in groups called banks) and can easily expand this to an entire afternoon or a whole day. They will start by issuing a waiver (I'd bet, for this storm, some time tomorrow). If they aren't that worried, the waiver will just allow for free changes to flight dates/times but if they really don't want you to fly they will offer to just let you cancel and use the value on any future flight. Remember, that if they ever cancel your flight, even if part of a weather event, you're always eligible for a refund (not just credit). \n\nThe worst is when the storm is worse than they expected and whatever they pre-planned doesn't work.

According to [https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html](https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html)

""Passengers will be able to hold a reservation without payment, or cancel a booking without penalty, for 24 hours after the reservation is made, if they make the reservation one week or more prior to a flight’s departure date.""

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

So I disputed the $200 fee with my bank, and just now I've realized that I lost the dispute.

As for the 3rd party, if it was a 3rd party who booked this, it was an @travelersdesks.com email address who sent me confirmation. Does anyone know what company this is? I was in contact with them through Delta's direct customer service line +18002211212 from an agent claiming to be a supervisor.","['Did you ask to change it, or ask to cancel it?', 'Edit to update my understanding of what happened, original reply at the end\n\nI just go through your post again and realise something. From what I understand, here is what happened:\n\n1, you called Delta to request for a change, which Delta does not allow. What Delta can do according to their terms and the US law, is to fully refund you the ticket.\n\n2, you argued with Delta, supervisor ended up refunding the DL ticket entirely, which is $143.\n\n3, Supervisor booked you the AA flight via a 3rd party website (because DL don\'t sell AA tickets), which cost you $200. Hence the $200-$143=$57 save you mentioned.\n\n4, You think the $200 for the AA flight is change fee and dispute it with your bank but failed.\n\nSo, can you help me out and clarify something?\n\nWhen you request the change, is the new flight still a Delta flight with the same price? Or did you propose the AA flight from the beginning?\n\nHow much was the AA flight if you book it through AA directly? Any chance it is $200?\n\nI am asking this is because I think DL isn\'t at fault here after all. They refunded you the cost of the Delta flight as you mentioned, which means they comply with their own rule and the US law. They then helped you booked another flight even though it\'s not their flight.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but it seems like what you are saying is that after you made the mistake of booking the wrong flight, not only do Delta have to refund you the ticket, but they should also pay for your new ticket at no cost to you?\n\nSo what you are paying, is not the ""change fee"", it\'s the price for the AA flight that you wanted.\n\nUnless Delta used your credit card to pay for the AA flight without your consent, I don\'t see why your bank should approve the dispute here. But they won\'t have that information unless you give it to them.\n\n_________________________Original reply below_____________________________\n\nFrom what you describe, it looks like you may have purchased the ticket from a 3rd party website and the Delta call centre agent may have put you with the 3rd party to resolve the issue.\n\nI can’t say for certain without more information. But call centre agents sometimes can initiate a 3-way call while the customer is still on the line. What it means is that they put you on-hold, then they dial the 3rd party for you, wait for the call to be answer by its agent and explain the situation then patch you through. Once you and the 3rd party is connected, the Delta agent may then disconnect from the call. They do this so customers don’t have to hang-up and dial another number and explain the whole situation again. Because of this, it would appeared as you just called Delta, but in fact you were dealing with the 3rd party who sell you the ticket.\n\nThe only way you can receive a e-mail from that 3rd party is because you booked with them. Otherwise they won’t have the authority to change your ticket.\n\nAs for the US law part, the practise is usually they fully refund the ticket to you then you purchase whatever ticket you want. The law did not specify that airlines and travel agents have to allow change. As long as they give you a loss-less option defined by the law, then it’s legal.\n\nAlso, the law only apply to transaction happened in the US, so if the 3rd party is registered outside of US and princess that transaction outside of US, they are not obligated to follow that law. If you use the airlines overseas website, because the transaction is not process in US dollar or by their US offices, the law also doesn’t apply.', 'Did you personally book this flight on delta.com?

Basically, even after DL has refunded the original ticket, OP still think DL should change the ticket free of charge. \n\nFor argument sake, let\'s say DL should change the ticket free of charge, then at best DL owes OP $57 ($200-$143).

I got over it, however afterwards I found out they cancelled my return flight even though it was weeks in advance due to missing my prior flight. 
Do other airlines due this?
I spoke to the customer service manager and he told me if you miss any part of a flight, all of your flights you purchased are cancelled. To me it sounds like Spirit uses the oppurtunity to sell more seats.","['Every single airline does this actually if you don’t notify them in advance.', 'This is standard operating procedure for, dare I say, every airline.', ""Don't blame spirit. It's in their terms and conditions and every single airline does this.\n\nThis one is entirely on you."", 'The reason airlines do this is because sometimes they want to sell a round trip for cheaper than a one way. They will also cancel the second leg of connecting flights if you miss the first flight for similar reasons, sometimes they want to sell the whole connecting flight for less than the price of a single leg by itself.\n\nIt is a business behavior that economists call ""price discrimination"". It is a symptom of uncompetitive markets. IMO consumers would be better off if it was illegal, but there is debate within the economics field as to whether that is true. Defenders would argue that it allows airlines to provide lower fares to price-sensitive consumers that otherwise might not be able to fly, or fly as often, subsidized by non-price-sensitive consumers such as business travelers. If it was illegal as I suggest it should be, maybe the cheapest fares couldn\'t be quite as cheap. But higher fares wouldn\'t be as high either, because airlines would never be able to charge you more for a one-way than they are charging someone else for a multi-leg or round trip that includes that one-way. Same for round trips departing or arriving at hubs.\n\nFor example, say you want to fly Minneapolis to Tulsa, and Minneapolis only has one hub (Delta) and Tulsa has no hubs, and most flights to Tulsa are from other airline hubs. Delta is the only nonstop flight from Minneapolis. Your only other option is connecting, which adds a lot of time and stress, so Delta charges high fares for that nonstop round trip Minneapolis to Tulsa. However, since Tulsa has flights to multiple hubs for American, United, and Delta, there are dozens of ""third"" cities you could fly from that would allow you to connect to Tulsa in one stop. Some of these third cities could make that connection on Delta in Minneapolis. Maybe you have a third city that can connect to Tulsa in one stop on ANY of Delta, American or United, so maybe those airlines actually want to compete on price for that route to win marketshare, since none of them have the advantage of offering a nonstop. This is how you get a situation where it may be cheaper to fly from a third city THROUGH Minneapolis to Tulsa and back then it would be to just fly from Minneapolis to Tulsa. And if my proposition was made law, Delta would never be able to charge you more to fly from minneapolis to tulsa than they charge anyone flying THROUGH minneapolis to tulsa.', ""In airline theory it goes like this: since you missed your first flight then you didn't fly to your destination. Since you didn't make it to your destination then you don't need the return flight or flights. So, the airline cancels your paid ticket/seat for the return. I'm not saying I agree or not but this is how airlines think."", ""It might be in all airlines' terms & conditions. But it's still bs. In the end you payed for that flight."", ""This is what I was getting at, airlines see your misfortune of missing your flight as an oppurtunity. They write the terms and conditions in a way to where they can sell your seat you already payed for. It's a business model as you said that is geared more for making money than caring for customers."", ""It really is more about ensuring that people don't evade the price discrimination that I described above than it is about exploiting the fact that you missed a flight. Think about it- wouldn't Spirit (or any airline) prefer a satisfied customer that upon learning that he was going to miss his outbound flight, would call Spirit and let them know, to give them as much opportunity as possible to sell that ticket? They would get whatever cancellation fee plus the maximum amount of time to re-market that ticket and potentially fill that seat. As opposed to their current policy which just pisses off passengers and causes them not to warn Spirit, since their whole round trip arrangement are ruined anyway. But they can't, because if they let people cancel just certain legs of their round-trips or multi-leg flights, they wouldn't be able to engage in the price discrimination I described above, which is a huge part of their pricing strategy."", 'ooooh I see!', 'Thanks for the business lesson!']"

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I flew from AUS to EWR on Delta. When I got my bags, I noticed one was missing the luggage tag ([Pics here](https://imgur.com/a/ZVBAdN5)). I'm not sure what manner of herculean mutants they hire as throwers, but they managed to rip a braided steel cable in half. Normally, I would just suck it up and order a new one (I've lost the cheap plastic ones plenty of times), but given the clear evidence of mishandling (and it's a $20 tag), should I pursue this with Delta? Just trying to decide if it's worth kicking the tree on this one.","['No chance :)', ""The problem with dangly bits, including luggage tags, bag straps, all sorts of things, is that the belt systems that get your back from check in to the baggage room(s) is full of places where loose items get ripped off. \n\nEvery section of belt has joints where things get caught. You should see the stuff that collects in trays under the joints. They fill up with tags and straps and bits of everything. And since no one wants to pay airlines to have staff personally carry your bags to the flight, belt systems are what we have. \n\n\nThis is why most luggage manufacturers have tags inside the bag, or that are stuck to the surface of the bag, rather than sticking out. \n\nUnfortunately there's an industry ready and willing to sell you items they know full well might not make it through a single trip. Don't spend $20 on bag tags. Mark your bags in a place where it can't get torn away."", 'Ramp agent here. Ya know, one of those “Herculean mutants” who throw your bags.\n\nMost of the occasions I see tags get damaged are the ones made of weaker material, a metal wire like that would take even a stronger ramp agent quite some effort to actually break it. Looks like it was most likely snagged on a conveyor. There have been countless times I’ve seen stuff on bags get torn off because they get snagged in the spaces between the belt movers. If you’ve got one of those strong ones with the steel wire/cable, it’s more likely to stay intact, but when it gets snagged, something’s gotta give and it’s generally the weakest point that breaks first. From the picture, it’s likely that the card/tag itself had gotten stuck in between the belts and then the buildup of other successive bags strained it to the point where the cable finally snapped.\n\nDFW has more than 40 miles of conveyor belts and it’s not counting the movable ones that get pulled up to load baggage into the aircraft. It’s not a solid belt either since it curves which leaves plenty of open spaces in between; leaving all the more chances something external could get snagged and cause a jam. They happen more often than what people think.\n\nUnfortunately I don’t think you’ll get very far with customer service on this since stuff like that happens on a daily basis. Best thing for you to do for identifying your bag is to use something that is attached already to the bag itself like a screen or use the free disposable ones that are available at the check in kiosks. Better to lose a simple tag that can easily be replaced than get a strap or handle ripped off the bag itself.', 'It appears like a bad crimp on the cable, but like others have said, external items get ripped off all the time because of the belt system.

I'll just soak the cost and carry on. Lesson learned."", ""Also, I want to clarify that I meant no disrespect to the folks who work the desks/baggage.

On the day I was coming home BA wouldn’t let anyone check-in using their phone and instead had to check-in at the desk. When I went to check-in at Barcelona there was an insane line with 2 agents working it. The agents were doing the typical Spain’s thing and taking their sweet time, taking a break every 20 minutes, etc. Got up to the desk to check-in finally and they were like “oh yeah your flight closed, sorry”. Then had to go arrange to get on the later flight to London and BA made me pay $300 to do this. This made me miss my other flights which cost $795 to move to the next available flight. BA has not responded to me at all. I’m extremely pissed because it’s their fault their app wasn’t letting people check-in which would’ve let me skip being in a massive check-in line. And of course BA is making me and everyone else who dealt with this scenario suffer. 

Anyone have any tips on how to bitch to the right person? Calling is useless, formal complaint seems to be useless, and tweeting at them Trump-style isn’t working either.

DFW-LHR and you booked flights LHR-BCN separately is what I am reading. \n\n\nEither way, I suggest you write to BA on their online form (search BA Customer Relations) and write concisely what happened and most importantly **what you want them to do to make it right**.\n\nCite conditions of carriage 3c4 if you need (search that as well) to and state that you were unable to act due to their failure to check you in on-time, despite being at the airport with plenty of time (do you have proof of arrival time, possibly uber receipt for metro tapout transaction)."", 'Just checking - so the two legs (BCN to LHR and LHR to DFW) were on two different tickets?

When i fly out of orlando, do i have to go through the international security line? how does that work since ill just be swapping terminals in FLL THEN leaving the country?

Also,  i know that in atlanta ill have to hit customs which is fine, ill only have a backpack and small carry on and dont really plan on bringing anything back.

52,Fiance an I removed from Delta Flight due to glitch,1,4xyjyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/4xyjyw/fiance_an_i_removed_from_delta_flight_due_to/,16,1471366529.0,"So I've got a few questions here, I've already contacted the Department of Transportation in the USA, however I need to know about baggage. First you need backstory.

Basically my Fiance an I were 2 hours early to our flight, we were checked in and everything was good, itinerary, boarding pass, tickets etc all for the 9th of August. When it came time to board our tickets flashed red with an error about ""lack of flight crew"" or something, but the gate agent saw we had the right boarding passes and let us on.

Once on the plane a lady ended up getting the same seat number as me (she was someone who was changed over to this flight to Seattle because she had missed hers the day before). After about 10 minutes, the gate crew turned up and told my fiance an I that we had to leave the plane. We showed them our boarding pass, and tickets etc, and they just said ""you need to get off"".

We had no idea at this point what the hell was going on. When we got back to the gate they told us ""You booked your tickets for tomorrow, not today"". Red flags instantly went up, we were like ""hold on no we didn't?"" they wouldn't help us there, they told us we had to go back to the booking counter and sort it out there, so we did. Once there they told us the same thing ""you booked for tomorrow"". The lady who actually sent us through 2 hours earlier appeared and questioned why we were there, we told her and she said ""It said the 9th, their itinerary and everything is for the 9th"" that's when they went ""oops, it's just a glitch...you were meant to be on that flight"". I should point out that the flight had more than 10 seats left, so it was in no way full.

After 3 hours of piss arsing on their end, and explaining that I HAD to get back to Australia for an important VISA interview, they finally got us onto some flights. This is where it got even more stupid. They were unable to check our baggage in, and tried to tell us that we couldn't get on the flight because their system wouldn't let us check our baggage...until finally one of the guys was like ""We do have manual tickets you know"". So they got us manual tickets through the gate, and our luggage was put on there. Please note we had to fly to Seattle using Atlantic, because Delta had already left with no other flights for the day to Seattle.

Our next stop over from Seattle was to LAX, we arrived with 30 minutes to spare before we had to get on, and were assured our luggage was safely going to LAX.

So once we arrived in LAX, we had at least a bit of leeway with time, a good 1 hour and a half! To get to our gate. So we made it there, and turns out they gave our seats away! SHOCK! Well Delta did, at this point we were going to be flying through with Virgin, but it seems Delta didn't reiterate them our seats....eventually they sorted that out and we managed to get on the plane. We waited 2 hours....the plane wasn't leaving. Why? Apparently 22 passengers were missing from the plane, so they had to take their luggage off. Which was weird, because it sure as hell didn't look like 22 passengers were missing from the bloody plane.

Anyway after 14 hours we arrived back in Brisbane, and...no luggage. Nothing. In fact, it wasn't just my fiance an I, it was about 22 of us or so that lost our luggage. Turns out Delta's system didn't really relay to them correctly on luggage.

Anyway it took them 4 days to get our luggage back to us, now we've run into the issues in trying to get compensation.

Virgin Australia doesn't seem to have the option to make a claim for delayed luggage, in fact the details on my page are not up to date properly and seem to be reading wrong, not to mention they managed to screw up my email. On top of that we can't make a claim through Delta because we don't have a number for Delta's site that works.

So what I want to know is...what can we do? We had to spend about $200AUD just to get clothes and toiletries for the 4 days we had NOTHING. Do I call them? Or am I fresh out of luck?

According to TSA policy, I am fine (80Wh batteries), however, they state that individual airlines can have their own policies.  TSA policy is:

>Drones, Airwheels, airboards, solowheels, hoverboards, balance boards, balance wheels, and mini-Segways are considered portable electronic devices with lithium ion batteries.

>The allowance for passengers to have portable electronic devices in their checked or carry-on baggage is determined by the size (Watt-hour rating) of the lithium ion battery as follows:

>1) Where the lithium ion battery does not exceed 100 Wh passengers may have these devices in either checked or carry-on baggage.

>2) Where the lithium ion battery exceeds 100 Wh but does not exceed 160 Wh passengers may have these devices in either checked or carry-on baggage, but approval of the airline is required.

>3) Where the lithium ion battery exceeds 160 Wh the device is forbidden from being in either passenger checked or carry-on baggage.

>Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.

Any lithium ion battery containing more than 160 watt hours is prohibited from carriage on all passenger aircraft. Lithium ion batteries installed in a personal electronic device can be transported as checked or carry on baggage.

I fly within the US and would like to take with me this things:

- iPhone
- Laptop 14"" incl. charger
- Kindle Ebook
- UE Boom (bluetooth speaker)

This would all fit in my school bag and would be lighter than 12pounds.

Do you think I can take this things with me as carry-on, without problem or would I have to pay an extra fee or something (or even worse that they take it away)

I hope you can help me","[""You're fine. At most airports though, you'll need to take the laptop out of the bag at security. The iPhone, Kindle, and speaker can stay in the bag. Then just put the laptop back after you get past the checkpoint.\n\n\nThe rule of thumb for *most* airlines is that your carry-on has to be less than 45 linear inches, which basically means measure the length, width, and height and add the 3 numbers together. If they're under 45, you're golden."", ""Wingzfane99 has it covered.  Don't forget to put your laptop back in your bag after the TSA checkpoint. \n\nRead the TSA guidelines for carry on and checked baggage.  Some things have to be carry on, mostly batteries, and other things have to be checked, mostly sharp pokie things. \n\nEmpty your bags before packing to avoid surprises at the checkpoint. \n\nYou get to carry on 2 bags, but have one of them ready to gate check if you're in not in the first two groups boarding. Space runs out in the overhead bins.  Almost always they only gate check roll bags. My bookbag sized backpack and same sized computer bag never get gate checked. If it's raining your gate checked bag gets wet. Make sure any bag that might leave your person has your name and contact info on it. \n\nEmpty your pockets of everything, even paper, and take off your belt and shoes before getting in line for the body scan. If the scan isn't clean they get to pat you down.  \n\nWait for your bags and kit to enter the xray before going through the body scanner. \n\nDense heavy uncommon items will earn your carry-on bag some enhanced screening. TSA will want to figure out what it is. You can't help them unpack it, but once their done you get to pack it back up. \n\nDon't make any jokes or give the TSA crew any lip. Some of them have no sense of humor and can make your life miserable if you piss them off. Smile, be pleasant, and follow their instructions. \n\nCheck in online as early as possible in the 24 hour window before your flight. \n\nDelta charges for all checked luggage. Keep them under 50lbs or pay a stiff surcharge for overweight/oversize. \n\nEnjoy your flight.  \n\n"", 'Also make sure your liquids are under 3 oz or 100ml and you should be fine :) the airlines prefer you take your valuable items with you anyways !

All that really means is you can have a second, smaller bag in addition to the bag you mentioned in the original comment.

I may be wrong.  This may be based on seat location. \n\nEarlier check-in seems to provide a greater seat selection.

They said they would mail it back to me when they were able to dig it out but it's been a month and other than the ""we received your complaint"" auto-response email I have heard nothing from Delta.  I am open to suggestions on how to resolve this properly.

This is the message I sent to Delta Airlines:  

To Whom It May Concern At Delta,

During takeoff on DELTA 2379 on the morning of 3/16/2015 my cellphone slid out of my coat pocket and fell through a gap in the floor that should have never been there in the first place. 

There are these plastic panels that are supposed to be attached where the floor of the cabin and the curve of the plane fuselage meet.  I noticed that in my window seat ( 39F or 41F, I can't recall exactly, only that it was a window seat) that the panel to the right of the window seat directly in front of me was completely detached and being propped up by the bracket the seat is mounted to.  You could easily see a couple feet down into the plane through the hole.  The panel next to my seat was still basically attached but was shoved in at the bottom leaving about a two inch gap.  A gap, as it turns out, that is big enough for cellphone to fall through.

I had initially assumed my phone was just on the floor somewhere after I dropped it and that I would probably have to  wait until we landed at Minneapolis-Saint Paul to look for it, given the confines of the seating arrangement.  It was only when I was unable to find my phone anywhere where it would be reasonable expected to be found given the layout that I noticed the missing and shoved-in panels.  I theorized that it had probably fallen through one of the shoved-in/defective panel gap(s) and I voiced my concerns as such.  The flight crew were all standing around discussing what could be done, even the captain had come back to see what all the fuss was about.  I was told they were going to get an engineer to look for it while the plane was being prepared for it's next and within the hour take off.  

After about 20 minutes I asked a Delta associate behind the desk if she knew anything about the lost phone, and was told, after she went back down the ramp to ask, that they had indeed found my phone and that it had indeed fallen through the gap in the shoved-in panel and into the ""guts"" of the plane.  After not being able to reach it with the tools they had I was informed that they, understandably, aren't going to hold up a plane to fish out someone's cellphone, and that they would mail my phone back to me when they have more time to get it out.  They took down my address and info and I left to catch my connecting flight to Washington-Reagan.

I've just spent the last week driving my afraid-to-fly daughter and her two cats from Washington, DC to Medford, OR.  a 3,000+ mile trip where a cellphone full of important family contact info and working GPS is all but essential.  I went ahead and purchased a cheap cellphone and a prepaid SIM card, there was really no choice in the matter.  The phone is unfortunately horribly inferior to the Samsung Galaxy 5s of mine that is (probably), still ""flying the friendly skies"" for free wedged deep down inside the plane.  

I still have not received said phone back nor heard a word from Delta about it and can only surmise that they didn't bother or were unable to actually retrieve the aforementioned glass and metal electronic device from inside the body of the plane.

So it comes down to this: were it not for the sorry and disturbingly-poor state of the floor panels my phone would have never gotten lost in the innards of this plane.  Had the cabin been properly maintained this would have never been the huge problem it has turned into.  It is not unreasonable to expect a plane to be maintained at least to the level were it is somewhat difficult for electronic devices to fall into it's inner workings.  If my phone is not returned within the next couple weeks I expect Delta to either replace it with the exact same model or compensate me for its worth.  This is generously-reasonable request given the circumstances.

I eagerly await your reply.

Regards,

68,UPDATE - Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me and Delta Delayed My Bag,0,435b3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/435b3a/update_virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_and/,3,1454043520.0,"**UPDATE**

I have an update regarding my situation as [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/)

After advice from the comments, I haven't contacted Virgin Atlantic yet knowing that I have a weaker case against them.

However, Delta's claim officer called me couple days ago and said that since my flight plan was cancelled by Virgin Atlantic, it's not Delta's fault that they delayed my bags for over a week, so they won't reimburse me anything.

Here's the story about the lost baggage. Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. The whole experience has been super expensive and frustrating for me.

**December 14th, 7 AM** - I flew from PHL to JFK in Delta. 

**8 AM** - I landed in JFK. I was at the Virgin Atlantic's boarding gate for about 45 minutes trying to figure out my travel situation. The VA agents at the boarding gate told me that my bag has been pulled out of the plane and I can collect it from Delta's baggage claim.

**8:45 AM** - When I went downstairs to the baggage claim, I couldn't find my bag. I spoke to Delta agents and they said that *""yes, your bag was pulled out of the plane, but one of our staff made a mistake and put it back on the queue. But your bag is still in the JFK airport. We will have baggage handling guys pull it out from the queue and bring it back here. You can come back after 30-40 minutes to pick it up.""*

**9:00 - 9:30 AM** - I used those 30 minutes to step out to the lounge area and figure out the rest of the trip. I finally booked my tickets with United and made travel arrangements to go to EWR from JFK (neither VA nor Delta helped me here, off course).

**9:30 - 4 PM** - When I came back after 30 minutes, I found my bag was still missing. I checked again - and they said, they are having someone bring my bag to me and asked me to just wait. Now, this is almost 10 AM. I spent next 6+ hours at the airport in the baggage claim area trying to figure out where my bag was. Delta kept changing their story from *""Wait for few minutes""* to *""It's Virgin Atlantic's fault, talk to them""* (spoke to Virgin Atlantic staff but she didn't even bother to look into their system to find my bag), to finally Delta acknowledging, *""Sorry, we can't find your bag, but we know it's in JFK""*. Delta's baggage claim supervisor tried to find my bag in the system. He said the last time my bag was in Delta's system was at 10:30 AM in one of the racks but when he called a staff in the racks area to retrieve my bag, it was not there. And they don't know where my bag is.

**4 PM** - My flight to United was at 8 PM, but I still needed to take a bus to EWR, do security check up again and figure out if they were also going to refuse to board me. Delta's baggage supervisor said *""sorry we messed up""* many times. They acknowledged that it was their own staff who mistakenly put my bag in the queue AFTER it was pulled out from the VA plane. The supervisor asked me to fill out the claim information. I wrote down my Indian (Delhi) address and Indian phone number, and the supervisor said ""we will deliver your bag to your doorstep in Delhi in a couple days"". I got a tracking number and the supervisor told me to track my bag on www.delta.com/trackbag

**4:30 PM** - I leave for EWR. No issues while boarding there.

**December 15th 10 PM (Indian Time)** - I land in Delhi.  I check delta.com/trackbag. I see that the bag is on a KLM flight (Delta's partner) and is in Amsterdam. And it is scheduled to arrive in Delhi on December 16th. 

**December 16th** - I check delta.com/trackbag - no update in status. I spend entire day at my address to make sure I don't miss the delivery. I called Delta, gave them my tracking ID and my baggage tag number - they couldn't find any information about my bag. Asked me to call back next day when they have more information. Delta's 999 Baggage Assistance emailed me saying the same - they have no information but they are trying to find it. I have that email as a record.

**December 17th** - I check the website - still no updates. I called Delta again, they acknowledge that the bag was enroute to DEL through Amsterdam, but they have no current information. Asked me to give them one more day. Email asked for more details, but didn't provide any idea about what happened to my bag. 

**December 18th (Friday)** - I check the website - still no updates. I call Delta - they had no new information for me. They don't know where my bag is. At 4 PM (1 hour before the airline luggage counters close), I simply drove to the DEL airport. Walked up to the KLM luggage counter at the airport. Found my bag sitting there among a pile of other lost and found bags. The staff there asked me to sign my name before allowing me to take the bag home with me. 

**December 19th (Saturday India Time/Friday EST)** - Received an email from Delta - they still have no clue where my bag is. I told them that I found my bag.

**Fast Forward - last week** - Delta sent an email saying that they were sorry for the delay in my bag and that I would be eligible for any purchases I made during this time. Asked me to send them receipts, which I did.

**Couple days ago** - The Delta claim agent called, asked me to tell her why I got out at JFK. I just mentioned *""I didn't have the right documents for Virgin Atlantic, so needed a different flight""*.

81,Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying?,2,aczkcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/aczkcl/reasons_you_should_check_carryon_size_limits/,2,1546759211.0,"Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying:

1. Always check allowed sizes before a flight (they can change). Slightly oversized bags may make it on most flights, but eventually someone at a random gate will tell you it can't go onboard, that it will have to go as checked baggage, and possibly charge you for it (sometimes between transfers).

2. Certain items damaged in checked baggage are not covered under airline policies. You should ALWAYS declare said items if stopped at the gate and either repack to protect it or attempt to work out another arrangement. Never assume personnel saying ""Don't worry, we'll take good care of it"" is enough to place liability on the airline.

3. Despite nobody doing this, ever, READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE you are agreeing to before a flight. Usually when buying a ticket or at the time of check-in is when you agree to abide by said terms.

4. DOT only oversees guidelines for bag damage, not airline excluded items. Items not covered policies are acknowledged as an agreement between airlines and the passengers by terms of service / policies.

5. You may go through the hassle of having to physically file your claim at the airport within 24hrs or less of arrival, fill out a lengthy claim form with proof of purchase and photo evidence, possibly receive a cookie cutter response from corporate that your claim was denied (without providing a channel to explain the scenario that occurred), and realize you may have a low chance of winning a legal battle / wasted most of your time because your bag was just slightly more oversized than the allowed carry-on size you agreed to at the time of ticket purchase or check-in.

6. None of that may even matter because they allow for oversized carry-ons to begin with (or purposely choose to reduce overhead cabin size to increase checked bag sales) reducing available space, leading to (if you're unlucky enough) having your within limits carry-on bag go as checked baggage anyways. But hey, maybe you'll have more legal grounds to protect your items if you still follow reason 2 listed above.

7. Maybe you shouldn't fly anyways because the seats keep getting more cramped, less comfortable, you might get unlucky enough to be placed behind a higher class that can recline their seat into your face, and you could experience the consistent marketing taunt some airlines love to torture you with of how much better your experience could be if you paid them the big bucks (talking about you, Delta).

Side Note: Home insurance doesn't cover travel damage. Always keep receipts for all purchases. Read your product warranties, they usually do not cover physical damage or purchases by 3rd party vendors (which do exist on sites like Amazon).


My questions are:

1. Do you think enough social pressure would ever cause airlines to change their policies to benefit society as a whole versus pursuing lengthy and costly legal battles?

2. Are you going to read all of this or post a comment that says, ""do you seriously expect me to read all of this?"" before realizing I just called you out and delete your post but then possibly re-comment since I called you out again, but ultimately leave it up to chance because I'll end it with saying there's a probably you will either comment or not and suggest you should comment about people needing to read the fine print or terms of service. Or if you didn't realize I did all of this, we should all reply something stupid that seems like it should make sense related to the comment you posted.

3. Will this be reported at first glance for having my questions down at the bottom while riding the grey area of having an airline question along with a warning? If it does get take down, can I assume that this is a fact of life that life's a gamble and I probably will never receive an answer to stated question anyways?

4. Should we be more concerned as citizens that airlines are becoming too consolidated and are [extracted because idk if this language is allowed on this sub-reddit] us over with money grabbing policies, or accept it as a necessary evil to chance having unrestrictive opportunity (from a law perspective, unless lawmakers have money riding on that airline) to fuel the advancement of technology such as tablets on the back of seats? What solutions do you propose would lead to favorable outcomes for us citizens (or specific class level)?

5. Why Delta, why?

Edit:
6. Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying? (so it's not click bait)","['I mean, here\'s the thing about airline bag policies.  They allow for low ticket prices.\n\nThe glory days of flying that our grandparents or parents often speak about where everything was included sound very nice, but they were also when just a couple of airlines existed and ticket prices were very expensive.  I\'m sure there were deals to be found, but on the whole, you either had to have money or had to really save to fly.\n\nAfter cheaper airlines came on to the scene, legacy airlines saw their profits plummet and some didn\'t survive.  Cheaper airlines offered great deals, but also flew through cheaper airspace and did not have as much coverage.  Still, legacy airlines have to scramble to try to compete.  \n\nBag fees were introduced in the mid 2000s, and actually saw profits from some legacy airlines go from red to black, and allow for airlines to offer cheaper, more competitive rates.  I mean, we all complain about the cost of flying, but on the whole, it\'s pretty attainable for the common person, where it just wasn\'t before.  That\'s also why planes are getting more cramped and uncomfortable.  It\'s not just about making more money (though of course that\'s a large part), it\'s also about accommodating more and more flyers.  It\'s much harder to get more planes in the sky than to get more people on a plane.\n\nOf course no one wants to pay extra, so that results in much more carry-on luggage, and most people trying to get the airlines to make an exception for their larger bags because they don\'t want to pay checked baggage fees.  And since there is no way of verifying what you packed if your bag was lost, suddenly every person packed a $2000 laptop or solid gold sneakers.  So what results is airlines that have to limit what they cover in case of loss, and stricter enforcement of sizing rules.  After all, passenger 1\'s oversized bag, and passenger 2\'s oversized bag means passenger 3\'s not-oversized bag doesn\'t make it, which is hardly fair.\n\nThough to be fair, most airlines also make frequent verbal announcements to remove your valuables from bag that have to be checked just in case, though almost no one ever does.\n\nSo yeah, I mean, it sucks.  Flying is hard even when everything goes perfectly.  It\'s also one of the most unpredictable of all travel, inconveniences us the most, and is a form of travel we have the least control over.  But we do tend to villanize the flying industry way more than is necessary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Baggage and other fees help ticket prices stay low so more people can fly, but does cause greater inconveniences, which causes hate for the company.   I did read your whole post, and I do feel for your experience, but I also would prefer to be able to fly for a reasonable cost, and packing less or paying for a bag allows for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAddendum:  No one packs less.  They just feel that they are entitled to more because there are limitations in place.  Ex: ""I have up to 50 lbs for my bag fee?  I\'ll pack 53 lbs for a 3-day trip, even though I need and will use about half of what I packed.  Surely you will waive the fee just for me.""  \n\n&#x200B;', ""50.0 lbs ≈ 22.7 kilograms ^(1 pound ≈ 0.45kg)\n\n\n\n^(I'm a bot.

It ensures that you are confirming that you will be on the flight, many airlines at this point will have a good idea of seat availability for some cheaper tickets and fares that don\'t give you the option of selecting a seat at the time of booking, so it allows those fares and ticket holders to select seats and make sure the seats are reserved. Doing this will allow you to make sure that when you get to the airport, you will not have an unassigned seat, and will be given whatever is left about 30 minutes prior to boarding.

Concert tickets are fixed prices, if you sit in the front row, there's an overwhelming chance that the person next to you paid the exact same amount for their ticket; on a plane, this is most likely not true.

I was in the security line when I got a notification saying that my flight had been cancelled (1.5 hours prior to its scheduled take off). I went to the service desk and they got me on another flight with Delta but I had to connect at another airport (my original flight was a direct flight). My first flight in the connection was behind schedule and by the time we landed I had 10 minutes to get to my connection flight , which was at a gate on the other side of the airport (my connection flight was in ATL, and that airport is freaking huge!) When I finally got to the gate I was told the doors have been closed and I could not get on the plane (even though it was sitting right in front of me, but whatever rules are rules). I went to the desk again, was told there are no more planes with seats available going to my destination, so I was given a flight to an airport 1 hour away from my destination and I am now in a very expensive Uber to my original airport because my car is sitting in the parking lot.

Anyone have any experience with getting any compensation for something like this? Any advice would be much appreciated. Please and thank you!","['Well, you can ask.

Seriously, give United your money before these people. Worst policies and customer service I have ever encountered.

I had something unexpected come up and was forced to cancel my flight. I canceled SEVEN WEEKS before my scheduled departure. There was a $150 cancellation fee, which was brutal but understandable. On the page it does the calculation for you, informing me that after the cancellation fee I would be left with a $170 refund. I wasn't in love with it, but I didn't really have a choice. I clicked cancel.
Next day I check my email, and see that the $170 is not paid in cash, but in VA flight credit. What? For the $150 cancellation fee they couldn't even do me the courtesy of giving me the rest of my overpriced ticket price refunded in cash. That important detail was hidden in a morass of microscopic font on a different page. 

So I'm stuck holding $170 in flight credit. This is a problem, because where am I going to fly to? They have like six locations, and two are in Hawaii. To recap, VA gets $150 free and clear, they have seven weeks to fill that seat, and I the consumer am left with $170 of flight credit for an airline that has direct flights to a handful of locations, and if you don't happen to need to go directly to/from those places they charge a truly exorbitant amount for connections (hence my heinously overpriced $330 domestic one-way from JFK to Denver).

So that means I have to basically force a flight somewhere as a grad student to some place I don't need to go in the next 18 months, because that's the other catch -- in the email you get about your new ""Elevate"" flight credit, they cheerfully inform you that your points never expire... as long as you make some kind of transaction every 18 months. Well unless you're a business flyer, it's gonna be pretty tough to use those points every 18 months. I sure am not going to be able to find a way to force a flight to some random location in the next 18 months as a grad student with only $170 credit.

And this really sums up the entire VA experience. Throughout my hours-long conversations with customer service, I was reminded again and again that this was the policy, and I should have read it. Yes, I should have. Clearly. But time and again, whenever I made any decision on VA's website or in their emails, the visible information was always INCREDIBLY misleading. The Terms and Conditions are down at the bottom somewhere, a light gray link in size 4 font on a slightly darker gray background, and the reason they do everything in their power to hide the Terms and Conditions is because they are toxic. They are the least consumer-friendly policies of any company I have ever dealt with ever. 

So, if you have a very precise route and time in mind and you are 100% confident nothing will happen to disrupt that, and the sloppy constellation of oddball locations happens to line up for you, I guess VA isn't your worst bet. But if you have even the SLIGHTEST worry that something might come up, or that you might have to deal with these people for ANY reason, run. Run as far and as fast as you possibly can.

104,What airlines do you accrue miles with?,1,7mbspm,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7mbspm/what_airlines_do_you_accrue_miles_with/,6,1514366127.0,"I'm not sure if this is the sub to ask this. Let me know if it isn't.

I'd like to listen to what airlines you guys chose to accrue miles with and why (Different rewards programs, terms and conditions, customer experiences, already established accounts by family members etc)

I've been wanting to start accruing miles and I spontaneously made an account with Delta airlines today after booking a flight to save those miles. I don't remember having any negative experiences with Delta and thought this might be a good idea.","[""Why my opinion is valid: over 2M flown miles on American (lifetime Platinum status), about 900k on United, about 250k on Alaska, and then some more. \n\nAmerican Airlines has devalued their mileage program and are throwing a lot of miles out there and so it is a very deceptive program to be a part of today. They lead you to believe that accruing Miles can amount to free flights but it is exceedingly hard to actually get those free flights. Not only that, their Global Network of Partners isn't as attractive as what United has going on for them. So, even though I have lifetime Platinum Status with American, it is very hard for me to say that it is a program to be a part of today.\n\nUnited has a pretty decent program and they have an excellent International network of Partners and so it's hard to go wrong with them. Once you have status with United, you find that they have good availability across that Partners although some of them can only be accessed by calling the customer service line. Generally however, I have found that I can redeem my miles for good flights globally much more easily than on American.\n\nHowever, both of the above two Airlines require you to now have a minimum number of dollars spent per year. This creates a pretty big pressure on the customer because even if you were to fly the miles, that doesn't mean you can earn the status.\n\nOn this point, Alaska Airlines really has it going for them at the moment. They have a pretty good network of Partners and they do not require you to have a minimum spend. Their status program is a little different because they count miles flown on their metal and they also count miles flown on other people's metal. You can earn status regardless but the threshold is higher for other people's metal. It is, obviously, hard to fly their metal all the time unless you lived on the West Coast or did transcon.\n\nAll in all, I'm going to say you have to ask yourself where are you going next? And how eager are you to go there on a specific date and time? Because with American, I can assure you that you will find tickets but they will be at the premium Redemption most of the time and if you were planning on getting the discount Redemption, well good luck.\n\nOn United, you will find that the partnership with Lufthansa gives you a good assortment of discount business and discount Coach class tickets as well as the premium seats. In some cases, you have to change the date by a day or two but generally speaking, I found it to be pretty decent although there have been exceptions where I found no good flight whatsoever but generally speaking American has been worse in this regard.\n\nWhen it comes to Alaska Airlines points redemption, they have a table on what it would take to get the tickets on the partner Airlines. It's not a standard Redemption value like on United or American. So you'd have to check that table and then call customer service in order to book it with a partner and at that point it's up to the availability in the class of service."", 'Delta is screwing people with their miles to Europe now. Last summer I booked tickets for 60k points. This summer they were 150k points. \n\nFlying Blue is best, check out /r/churning.\n\nChase Sapphire will allow you to quickly accumulate 50k Mikes you can transfer to flying blue and book a r/t ticket to Europe.', ""As a non-US flyer, I accrue with Emirates due to their global network. It requires a lot of flying to level up, but as they go practically everywhere and are generally a great airline, I'm happy to consolidate with them as long as I'm taking 6-7 long haul trips annually. It would make less sense if you don't travel regularly.\n\nAlso, if you plan to travel outside of the US and your carriers don't service those areas, make sure you know their codeshare partners and what local status entitles you to when flying these carriers. \n\n"", 'I think wherever you live should probably be pretty high on the list.\n\nFor instance, I live in Houston, so obviously I build united miles. Mainly I have Chase UR points but those will go over to United whenever we plan a trip.', ""Thanks for your answer.\n\nI am currently based in the US, but won't be travelling as much in the near future as you do. Additionally, Delta travels globally as well.\n\nWhen you say level up, do you mean being able to convert accrued miles into trips or levelling up in the airlines member system for better perks?"", ""Re: first point, I'm thinking more about connecting to cities not served by Delta. What if you want to go to Perth, Phuket or Porto? You can get to Sydney, Bangkok and Lisbon but will you earn on the connecting flights with local carriers?\n\nRe: second, I am referring to increasing your status to add benefits. Emirates for example gives you more luggage, priority check-in and business lounge access for the second tier which is invaluable and a huge benefit. When living in Australia, I had equivalent with Qantas which meant no queues anywhere as long as I traveled with OneWorld airlines. Consolidate where you can to maximize benefits. ""]"

107,Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it...,2,7ac8ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7ac8ox/could_us_legacy_carriers_bring_back_domestic_3/,3,1509665206.0,"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?","[""If a 2-3 configuration was mixed with 2-2 and 3-3, wouldn't the aisle be crooked? "", 'Yes, but they already exist on planes like the CRJ, ERJ, 717, CS100 etc.', 'Not much different from how a CRJ or E-Jet with 2-2 economy will have 1-2 first class, or how an MD-80 with 2-3 economy will have 2-2 first class.']"
108,An Open Letter to the CEO of Frontier Airlines,11,5jv6v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/5jv6v9/an_open_letter_to_the_ceo_of_frontier_airlines/,12,1482496010.0,"An open letter to Mr. Barry L. Biffle, CEO of Frontier Airlines.

Dear Mr. Biffle,
I thought you might be interested in knowing how well Frontier did this holiday season.

My family’s plan was straightforward.  I’m in the military, currently stationed in Australia, having served in Korea the year before.  I haven’t seen my family in 12 months, with the exception of two one-week windows during the summer.  Once when I was helping put my mother in hospice care, and again at her funeral.  This holiday season was the perfect time for a family vacation to Disney World.  My four year old is at the magic age where a hug from Tigger IS a hug from Tigger, and not a guy in a suit.  My daughter is a senior in High School, and this Christmas was going to be the golden time for one last family vacation before she pushed out into her adult life.  We even convinced my father to meet us down in Orlando, so he wouldn’t spend his first Christmas season alone.  When my daughter graduates, my family will join me in Australia, and trips to Disney, or even to visit my father, would be cost prohibitive.  This holiday season was supposed to be the time for me to have that family vacation where I could reconnect with my family.  We had a condo lined up for the week before Christmas at a beautiful resort (seven swimming pools!).  I flew in from Australia on the 15th, and would leave from Colorado Springs with my 17 year old and four year old on 17 December.  My wife and 13 year old son would join us on the 18th, since he was competing in the State of Colorado First Lego League Championships.  My father would fly down from Michigan on the 18th as well, staying at the same resort.  Maybe not the simplest, but a straightforward plan nonetheless.  Frontier Airlines seemed the perfect airlines to transport a family of five.  I wasn’t looking for frills, and I had never had a problem with them before.

There had been some weather overnight, and on the morning of the 17th, my wife checked your website to find the flight had been cancelled.  It seemed odd that it was cancelled so early, especially given other flights from other airlines didn’t seem to be cancelled.  But, the weather was bad, and I acknowledge weather can indeed have cascading effects on airlines.  Throughout that day, I spent a total of nine hours on hold.  You might be unaware of it, but the way your phone system is designed, it automatically disconnects when someone is on hold for four hours.  You might want to consider investing in one of those “call-back” systems, instead of subjecting people to four hours of Frontier propaganda on how great the airline is.  By the time I reached a customer service rep, I managed to get me and two of my kids booked for the 19th.  I’d also like to point out that I never received an email, or any notification the flight was cancelled.  In fact, your voice system was still tracking it as on time.  If my wife hadn’t decided to check the website, I wouldn’t have known until I arrived at the airport.  I was losing two days from my vacation, but I could live with that.  The worst part was telling my four year old we weren’t going to Disney that day.

The plan was manageable.  I called the condo and rental car company and let them know my wife wouldn’t be checking in until the 18th.  She and my son would meet my dad in Orlando.  They would spend the day shopping for food, getting Disney tickets, and preparing for me and my other two kids to arrive on the 19th  Not an ideal plan (I was paying for a night at the condo that wasn’t being used), but totally manageable.  As we loaded their bags into our van so I could drive them to the airport, my wife received an email saying the flight was cancelled.  This was a total shock.  No other airline was cancelling flights, and I had been checking the website all day; there was no indication it was cancelled until two hours and twenty minutes before the flight.  It was allegedly cancelled because of weather.  Yet no other airline was having weather issues.  Your plane makes an Orlando-Phoenix-Colorado Springs loop.  Weather at all three airports was clear.  I spend another three hours on hold, and finally get a customer service representative.  She tells me I can get a refund or reschedule the flight for the evening of the 23rd.  Which would give my wife and son a grand total of ONE day at Disney World before our flight back the morning of the 25th.  

The plan was expensive.  I got a refund, and managed to get two tickets via Delta for the morning of the 20th.  The tickets were a little out of my price range, but it was worth being together as a family.  I called the condo and told them to hold the room until the next night (again paying for a night that I wasn’t able to use).  I lost the rental car reservation, and am unsure whether I will be refunded the money I spent on the voucher.  My father was now alone in Orlando with no family.  I had just blown my budget for the vacation buying last minute tickets.  But we would be together as a family, and I wouldn’t have to tell my four year old we weren’t going to see Mickey.  It wasn’t an ideal plan, it had gotten very expensive, but in the end, everyone would be together and happy right?  I spent all day on the 19th checking not only my flight status, but the flight from Phoenix to Colorado Springs.  Both were on time for most of the day, but before I left for the airport, the website showed a 40 minute delay.  We pack our van up, load up me and two kids, and head to the airport.  We arrive at the airport, and check in.  The lady behind the counter says the flight is delayed, but when I ask if the plane is even in Phoenix, she says yes.  Having looked at the weather map, I know the weather between Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Orlando is good.  It looks like everything is on track!  My four year old is higher than a kite, almost impossible to control as he gets more and more excited about leaving.  He points out every plane through the window as we walk to our gate, absolutely sure that the plane he is pointing to is the plane that is going to take us to Mickey. As we get to the gate, a board notifies us that the flight will be delayed two hours.  I don’t understand why, since the plane is in Phoenix, and the weather is clear.  But ok.  Our bags are checked, every employee is saying we are going to be taking off.  I settle in, and work on occupying a hyperactive four year old.  Then all hell breaks loose.

The plan was a Cluster*#@!.  It started as a rumor, and quickly spread.  The flight had been cancelled.  No Frontier employees were around, but everyone pulls out their phone and checks the website, sure enough it reads cancelled.  People begin to call Frontier (interestingly enough, most people had that number handy).  No employees at the gate.  Zero.  Zilch.  People begin to line up.  As I go to get into line, my four year old begins to cry as he realizes he isn’t getting on the plane.  After about twenty minutes, three Frontier employees march up to the podium, and have the audacity to tell us the weather had caused the flight to be cancelled.  What?  For three days in a row, Frontier had cancelled a flight because of “weather.”  When it was pointed out that the weather wasn’t bad in any of the three locations, the employee stated that it was because the weather had prevented a rested crew from getting to Phoenix.  What?  The flight hadn’t flown for three days and you didn’t have a rested crew?  You couldn’t get a rested crew to the correct location?  This rings as untrue and disingenuous (heck, use a different airline and fly a crew to Phoenix).  It gets better.  Your employees state they weren’t even going to try to rebook.  You could either get a refund or call the toll-free number to try to rebook (but nothing was available until after Christmas).  And because the cancellation was caused by “weather,” no vouchers for hotels or flights would be given.  Apparently Frontier is effected differently by the weather than other (more reputable) airlines are.  So to sum up so far, I’ve paid for three nights on a condo that I haven’t used.  Lost a rental car reservation.  My recently widowed father is alone in Orlando.  I have two tickets to Orlando on Delta schedule to fly out on the 20th, but three members of my family with no tickets.

As I type this, my wife is trying to enjoy Disney World with my father, and our four year old (at $1300 for last minute ticket, I couldn’t afford for my whole family to fly).  From the pictures I’ve been sent, his smile is something to make the meanest villain smile and remember fond childhood memories.  For the last six months, I was looking forward to being with my family (and seeing that smile in person), and having one last family vacation.  Now I sit with my two teenagers binge watching TV (I should have never given the 17 year old the control of the remote), and missing out on the joys of my family being together.  Your airline absolutely ruined one of the (if not the) last family vacations I will have before my daughter leaves the house.  After 18 months away from my four year old, I missed an opportunity to bond with him, and a chance for him to be with his father on the happiest place on earth.  Your airlines brought stress, unanticipated expenses, and ultimately unhappiness to my family.  To be succinct, your airline sucks the joy out of life and turns the tolerable experience of flying into a living nightmare.

So why do I write to you.  Well for a few reasons.  One part of me wishes that investors see this, and realize what a sinking ship your company is.  This will in-turn prevent you from taking the company public, and as word of your crappy and unreliable service spreads, the private owners of the company will take a shellacking while the company goes belly-up.  Another part of me wishes that you realize how horribly your company is doing, and in a public relations stunt, you provide an all-expenses paid trip reuniting me and my family in Disney World.  Both unlikely, so instead, allow me to provide you some pointed feedback you need to make if you want your company to survive this fiasco.
•	Remember that travelers value reliability above comfort and price.  It’s great to only pay for what I want to use, but if you can’t guarantee that you’ll have me in the right place at the right time, then your airline is useless to me.  Yours was the only airline effected so drastically by the weather.  Most airlines had righted their ship within 6 hours of the storms.  Yours took longer than 72 hours, and still left people stranded.  You need to build up redundancy in your airline to anticipate weather/maintenance/mismanagement.  It might cost you more in operating expenses, but in the long run, you will keep customers coming back.  All the last 96 hours did was create thousands of people who will never fly Frontier again (and their families).  Ryanair, the epitome of no frills and cheap, is, at its core, reliable.

•	Have transparency when talking to your clients.  We are not idiots.  I know no other airline was affected by weather.  I know the weather at the three cities in question was flyable.  I know planes can travel over and around bad weather between cities.  Don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining.  If the other rumors that this was really caused by a sick-out/strike are true, then you need to tell people that.  If an employee said “hey, we can rebook you, but we think there is a sick-out going on, it’s up to you,” then I can make the choice if I want to risk it.  Instead you strung me along for three days, each day costing me more money.

•	Own your mistakes.  Weather may have provided the first wrinkle, but let’s be honest, your employees mismanaged planes and crews.  And you need to own that mistake.  And then you need to throw free stuff at people.  If you refunded my $1000 in tickets and gave me a $2000 voucher to use over the next two years, do you think I would be bitching right now?  No.  I would be telling people that Frontier had some major problems, but they went out of their way to try and make things right.  Instead I’m telling people I will never fly Frontier again, and they ruined my last chance at a family vacation after being apart from them for a year.  Oh, and since we both know it wasn’t weather, then there wouldn’t have been countless hours by your clients and employees rebooking flights that weren’t really going to take off.

•	Invest in some customer service infrastructure.  I spent over 12 hours on hold over a 48 hour period.  Hire another call center.  Or update your system to allow call-backs so I don’t have to wait with my ear to the phone.  If you do choose to ignore any of my advice, please at least change your on-hold message.  Plug in a radio station or comedy channel or something.  But for the love of god, recognize that four hours of your propaganda is cruel and unusual.


Mr. Biffle, your mistake was cutting so many costs that you couldn’t handle a simple (and expected) down turn in weather.  Whether it was lack of redundancy, mismanagement of resources, or alienated pilots, you’ve cut too many corners to try and stay cheap.  If you aren’t viewing the events of 17-19 December as an existential crisis of your airlines, then you are misreading the American public, and our tolerance for incompetence with high value items.  You are about to make Frontier the Schlitz Beer of the airline industry, destined to be a case study to MBA students on how to turn a viable company into a footnote.  I saw the lines at the counter and endured the hold time, there is a demand for your services, but people will never demand crappy service for hundreds of dollars, and that, sir, is what you are currently providing.

The only reasonable flights are flying Frontier to and between Frontier, US Airways, and American Airlines flying back. I've only ever flown JetBlue before, and have only ever had good experiences with them.

My question is, basically, how are your experiences onboard with those airlines? Like, with JetBlue, you get free snack and beverages, and are also able to watch tv. Although, those things are not important to me, but they definitely make the trip more comfortable.

My friend(who is a huge enthusiast of anything aircraft and also works at an airport) recommended Delta over American.

I know it probably doesn't matter, but I figured I ask for everyone's opinion on which they prefer.","['Keep in mind that JetBlue is one of the better domestic airlines on the US, and to the best of my knowledge no other airline has personal TVs across their whole fleet, and when you do get a personal TV you usually need to pay to watch most content. However, I know that Delta offers a netflix-like service through their app if you connect via wifi with enough free content to keep you occupied. For this reason, in addition to the fact that in my experience service on Delta tends to be better than the other airlines you mentioned, listen to your friend and fly with them. Also, flying on one Airline both to and from Miami may help keep costs down. Out of curiosity, where are you flying from? ', ""You also aren't looking at FLL as a substitute?

"", 'AA has terrible service generally - but for a short hop like this, just go with the airline that matches your time/value preferences the most.

Usually it pays off to choose when you\'d actually want to go and to which airport - and then take it from there.

Delta is part of Skyteam, the worst of the big 3 alliances - AA is part of OneWorld, the best one IMHO. United is part of Star Alliance, the less bad one. \n\nIf you don\'t fly a lot and/or fly for work internationally, alliances don\'t matter.

118,Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me After Flying Me From PHL to JFK and Refused to Refund My Money - What to do?,1,42hdq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/,2,1453693768.0,"Dear Redditors, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this question. 

I am just looking what's the best thing for me to do and some advice on how to proceed on this nightmare that I faced last month. Also, is there any hope to get any percentage of money refunded - either for departure or return tickets.

**Here's the story (sorry it’s long):**
Couple months ago, I bought a round trip ticket for last month from PHL to DEL (New Delhi, India) on Virgin Atlantic last month. The connecting flights were from PHL to JFK (with Delta - partnering with Virgin Atlantic), JFK to LHR (with Virgin Atlantic), and LHR to DEL (Virgin Atlantic). 

This was my first time flying with Virgin Atlantic. And here was my US Visa situation - I had an expired H1-B visa and I was flying to India to get the Visa renewed. Actually, the visa was already renewed by my employer, so I just need a new Visa stamp in an US consulate, which can only be done outside the US. I confirmed with a Virgin Atlantic customer service agent before flying that my Visa situation would not be an issue on the date of flying.

On the date of the flight, the Delta staff at PHL boarded me to JFK. Once I landed in JFK, the Virgin Atlantic staff at the JFK boarding gate refused to board me. They mentioned that I did not have an UK issued transit visa required for me to go through LHR. What bothered me most is that the staff there looked at all of my documents - my passport, current and expired visa documents - and falsely (I will explain why falsely later) claimed that I do not even have the right Visa documents for United States. They said “You do not have an US Visa or proper documents, you cannot leave this country and fly anywhere”. In reality, I actually did have all the paper work that I needed to leave the country, go to India, get my visa stamped at an US consulate, and then return back. 

I have been in United States for last 14 years, and this was the worst example of customer service I had ever experienced in my life. The staff were extremely rude, condescending, simply refused to help me, or find me another Virgin Atlantic flight that goes through other routes to DEL. 

When I called Virgin Atlantic customer service for further help, the staff on the phone couldn’t also help me with other routes. They had already flew me from PHL to JFK, so now I am stuck in the middle of my journey in an airport far from my home (Philly) without any help from Virgin Atlantic. If this were still in Philly, I could have just driven home and planned  something better. 

I called the customer service again - this time to cancel the remainder of my journey and they said that I needed to pay $200 more to cancel the remaining trip. I asked if I get a travel voucher instead - and they said that would also cost my additional money ($200+ more). When I asked if I can get a refund, they said the tickets are non-refundable and I needed to talk to my travel agent. I put Virgin Atlantic staff and my travel agent representative on a conference call. Essentially, the travel agent mentioned that the money is already processed by Virgin Atlantic, so VA needs to refund it. And Virgin Atlantic staff refused to proceed with any refund.

Finally, I had to purchase another direct flight on a different airlines (United) from a different airport (EWR) which cost me an arm and a leg. The tickets I bought for Virgin Atlantic were simply a waste since I could neither use them nor get any money for refund. 

In addition to all that, Delta lost my checked in luggage when I flew from PHL to JFK and they couldn’t find my bag in JFK airport. It took them more than 10 days to find my bag (well, more like after repeatedly calling them and trying to identify the location of my bag and unable to get any response from them, I simply drove to the airport in DEL, and found my bag lying near their airport counter, unattended).

Given the terrible experience with Virgin Atlantic, I did not take the return flight with them - so those return tickets were also wasted.

The United flight was a direct flight from EWR to DEL - the staff there did not have any issues with my documentations. And in the US Embassy in New Delhi, I got my Visa stamped instantly - the embassy staff there mentioned that I have been in US for long enough and I had all the right documentations for me to get it instantly approved - contradicting Virgin Atlantic boarding gate staff’s theory that I did not have the right US Visa documentations and hence their ground for refusal to board me. 

**tl;dr** - Virgin Atlantic (in partnership with Delta) flew me from PHL to JFK, before refusing to board me at JFK. Then they refused to refund my money and Delta misplaced my baggage for more than a week.
","[""Sounds like you have a few issues. Virgin Atlantic was not incorrect in their assessment that you didn't have a valid UK transit visa. That should have been your responsibility to look into and even Delta really isn't at fault on that one. \n\nIn terms of your refund, it all depends on the fare class. You should check the fare rules of your ticket very carefully. It would be in the interest of the airline to not refund you anything. However FAA rules are very clear. \n\nIf Delta was supposed to confirm that your visa should be an issue but they failed, they may be on the hook and not Virgin Atlantic. \n\nI know, as a fact, that if an airline carries you without proper paperwork for the destination, then they pay a fine to the FAA and are usually going to have to eat the cost of your deportation. However Delta only took you to JFK so you'll have to read the rules. \n"", 'Unfortunately, you have selected the wrong country to transit for your flights. Yes, Indian citizens would require a transit visa to transit via LHR. This is because the terminals are not interconnected with one another.\n\n\nYou are highly likely out of luck mate. Just try to negotiate with VS on any applicable refunds.\n\n\nTo add on, DL is probably not at fault here as they only served a domestic sector between PHL and JFK. This did not require them to check for any onward journey visas.']"

Based on what you are saying in your post, can I assume that you'll primarily use the miles you earn to buy award tickets between BDL-DTW?  If so, I'd find the award program that offers the most flights a day between those two destinations.  Considering DTW is a hub, and not BDL, and I'm not sure you'll want to go up to BOS or down to NYC, you'll probably want to look primarily at Delta.  The only other advice I could offer is to look at a Delta partner, primarily I'm thinking of Alaska.  Alaska allows you to earn miles while flying any of their partners, so you could earn miles weather you fly on Delta, American or Alaska.  Obviously Alaska doesn't fly between BDL-DTW, but Delta does, and American does via ORD.  You can use those Alaska miles to redeem on American or Delta, opening up more options, even though you'll likely never actually set foot on an Alaska aircraft.\n\nOne thing I'll put as a disclaimer, when I did a search between BDL-DTW on Alaska's website, using miles, no Delta flights show up, just one stop options on AA.

So I have a doozy of a flight coming up on KLM/Delta. 25 hours. I have about 30K miles on Delta...all of the flights are packed and the first class spots are wide open. 

Is there anything I can do to influence the powers that be to be bumped up for at least one of the flights? 

Thanks!","[""Probably not, honestly. Upgrades are given to those with status, highest status given first priority. So unless you pay for the upgrade, it's highly unlikely you'll get one. Is venture that since you have a connecting KLM flight, you're connecting somewhere at a hub in Europe. As such, there's bound to be a fair amount of people on your flight with a high status level. "", ""If you're flying delta for the transatlantic segment they'll likely sell upgrades for a few hundred bucks. There are no status based upgrades in the sky miles program for transoceanic flights--you have to pay or use miles even if you're diamond. ""]"
