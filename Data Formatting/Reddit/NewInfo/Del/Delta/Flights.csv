0,Flight tix to Amsterdam went down by half after i bought one,0,d76k3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/d76k3t/flight_tix_to_amsterdam_went_down_by_half_after_i/,33,2019-09-21 09:29:32,"Long rant below but learn from my mistake:

I was looking at flights to AMS from DFW for mid October in the beginning of August. Cheapest fares were around $500-600, i didnt buy at the time... 1 week later they doubled up to $1200, i was really upset but decided to wait for 3 weeks. I noticed the prices kept increasing so i decided to buy, thinking it'd get higher as the time goes... But nope. Few days after i booked a roundtrip Delta ticket and spent $1400, Google flight tracker notifies me that fares are now back to $600!! I lost my shit. Immediately changed my ticket ($300 change fee), thought I'd get my money back, but nope again they just give you ecredit to use on another Delta flight within a year... This is scam! How can they lower and increase the fares so drastically within weeks!? Considering there was still 2 months to the trip. Has this happened to anyone? And is there a way to get refund instead of store credit?"
1,"Flight cancelled with AA, found another on Delta and AA won't help. Need to vent.",1,ca9axc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/ca9axc/flight_cancelled_with_aa_found_another_on_delta/,28,2019-07-07 21:22:16,"My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

&#x200B;

2,Delta flights severely delayed,0,akxvxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/akxvxq/delta_flights_severely_delayed/,27,2019-01-29 11:02:23,"Edit: The reason for the delay isn't up for debate and it's not why I'm posting about this. Please for the love of God stop telling me it was the weather and just address my question. Thank you. 


My parents (68 & 66) recently went on a cruise and were trying to go back home to North Dakota. They were supposed to fly out of Miami, Florida with a connecting flight in Minneapolis, MN.

At 9:20pm (Eastern time) January 27 mom texted me ""We got on our plane late, had a delay on the runway, were conserving power, and then they couldn't get the plane started again. We're back in the Miami terminal waiting for another plane, but we won't make our connecting flight.""

I'm not sure how long the delay on the runway was. 

Mom let me know they got rebooked but it's going to leave over 4 hours later.
""Now we are looking at leaving at 1:00 am [January 28] They rebooked us to Bismarck tomorrow night, but said to check tomorrow to see if there are cancellations on an earlier flight.""

Mom texted me at 12:41AM (Central time)  that they got to Bismarck. That is on January 29th.

To me, this is unbelievable. Mom's notoriously nonconfrontational so I'd like to see if she's entitled to some compensation. I'm sure my dad was livid but this is outside his usual scope as he's never been the travel planner and doesn't even know how to use his flip phone very well. They're both in pretty decent health but mom hasn't had a great immune system since she had cancer 15ish years ago so I'm positive she'll catch some kind of cold, especially with this extended amount of time in the airports.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get some kind of compensation from Delta? Are there particular phrases I should use that seem to have better results, etc.? United has a policy on delays not related to weather and I can't believe Delta doesn't have anything on their website about compensation. I've always thought Delta was better than United, especially after that doctor got beat up on United. Thanks!"
3,Looking for a new airline,0,afzpjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/afzpjx/looking_for_a_new_airline/,26,2019-01-14 23:02:45,"After flying most of my life with them, Southwest finally pissed me off with their constant delays and poor service (which it really is once you peel back the layers; they just sugarcoat how they're screwing you). I realize that Southwest was considered one of the ""good ones,"" but I'm now shopping for a new airline. I fly between Dallas and DC 25+ times a year for work.

Problem is, I already have reasons to hate American and United, pretty much the only other options I have (I have no reasons to hate Delta but they are never a low enough airfare for me to expense it).

I have Southwest A-List but it looks like status matching isn't an option for me, because American has that weird status challenge program that I don't think I'd be able to meet the requirements for (nor do I want to pay for the privilege of trying it), and I already have Premier Silver at United through my Marriott Platinum Elite status.

What's most important to me is customer service when it comes to dispute resolution (i.e. making it right after a bad experience), timeliness of departing/arriving flights, and lastly, benefits I'd get through the FF program.

Who should I pick and why?"

6,Shanghai or Honolulu for a Layover (Osaka to NYC),1,9r03es,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/9r03es/shanghai_or_honolulu_for_a_layover_osaka_to_nyc/,19,2018-10-24 18:20:42,"I'll be flying from KIX to NYC (JFK or EWR) over new year's and since there's never any chance of a direct flight, I try to make the most of my layovers. This time around, I see two affordable options.

First, I can fly with China Eastern/Shanghai Airlines and get a long-ish layover of 13 hours or more in Shanghai, which would be plenty of time to get into town, have lunch and see a couple things.

Second, I can fly Delta/Korean Air and get an 8-hour layover in Honolulu. This doesn't give me as much time, but it would be enough for lunch and perhaps a short walk along the ocean. There is also the possibility of a layover in Korea on the way back, though getting from ICN to Seoul isn't quick, so I'm not counting this in my decision making.

I've never been to either Shanghai or Honolulu, but both seem fun. The Shanghai option is a bit cheaper (about $100), but the Honolulu option is more direct and there's (edit: slightly) less total flight time. I've never flown Delta, but the return route is handled by Korean Air, which I like. I've never flown with China Eastern or Shanghai Airlines, but I generally avoid Chinese airlines when possible.

Anyone have an opinion on which might be the better layover? Thanks!"

Like any other passengers, as much as possible we want to save money but we also wanna weigh the risks of booking over the phone. We can do a cheaper flight by booking two separate flights, ATL-LAX then LAX-MNL. 

We can definitely book those online however this would be his first time flying and I just don't want him to get stranded in a foreign country or miss his second flight. So we opt for one way. Only airlines we tried that let us book online is Delta however the prices varies from $1,400 to $2,000 and that's just way too pricey

So I feel this leaves us to book over the phone. What airlines have you tried booking over the phone and it turned out fine? Are there any airlines we should avoid for a first time flyer? Or any 'upgrades' we should grab/ avoid that the CSRs are probably gonna offer?

Thank you so much!

A lot of search options but I can’t seem to find anything lower than 1200 each. 

Preferred departure from Dayton Ohio, will also depart from cincinnati or Columbus. 

Will fly into Venice, Florence, wherever I can get the best deal. 

So far I’ve looked mainly at flying into Venice or Rome and flying out of the opposite. 

Checked Skyscanner, google, kayak. 

Also checked delta, American Airlines, and United’s website specifically. 

I will pay 1200 each ticket if that’s what’s required, but I’m trying to find the best deal possible. 

Any sites I’m missing? I don’t know if I have too many search possibilities and that’s why it’s more complicated for me to search effectively. 

Any help appreciated!!

12,Connecting Flight With Short Layover Worries,1,6p4ki8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/6p4ki8/connecting_flight_with_short_layover_worries/,20,2017-07-24 03:09:43,"I am going on a solo trip from Miami to Tokyo later this year. I don't travel much so although I read *some* things in FAQs along with other sties that touch on the subject, I just like to get direct answers to my personal questions as it contains a few more specifics. 

From what I've read, it seems my layover may be a little on the short side considering I'm connecting to an international flight. I'm just worried that I might miss my flight and also not sure if I would have to pick up my checked luggage. 

Here's the situation: 

I am flying Delta and trip was booked on one round trip (Note: all times Eastern).

- I'm supposed to depart from Miami International Airport on a Wednesday at 8:40 AM and arrive at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 10:31 AM.

- There is supposed to be a 1 hour and 13 minute layover in ATL. 

- After the layover, the next leg of the trip is from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 11:44 am to leave for Narita International Airport.

If you have flown via Delta or have experience at ATL, do you think that layover is enough time for me to catch my flight to Japan, especially considering it's an international flight? Do I have to go through customs or another security check?  

I'll ask again at the counter when I get to the airport but does anyone know if I would have to collect my checked luggage from my Miami flight in ATL as both flights are Delta and they were purchased on the same ticket? Or will Delta automatically send my luggage to the next flight? How long does that process usually take? This might actually influence if I decide to take a checked luggage or not.  

I know the FAQ touched on this briefly but I'm hoping I can get more specific answers to my questions. I'm an international travel newbie, so I am just trying to be extra sure.

I should note that we live in NJ, and they would love to leave from Newark since we live only 30 minutes away, but I think I could convince them of JFK or LGA for proper savings. They probably won't be interested in a layover longer than an hour or two which might constrain us a bit (although some of the fares I noted above were either nonstop or short connections)."

The flight has to be on Delta and I need the medallion qualification miles (MQMs) so I'm pretty sure I have to physically fly it. I lose all my progress at the end of the year.

18,Need help with choosing a flight into Buffalo NY from Incheon,0,6c9yzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/6c9yzl/need_help_with_choosing_a_flight_into_buffalo_ny/,16,2017-05-20 15:52:52,"Hello! I'll be flying into Buffalo NY from Incheon this August and have to choose between Korean Air or Asiana Airlines (their flight timings and prices are the best so far).


If i were to take Korean Air, i'd be able to book the entire journey from Incheon to Buffalo under KAL, whereas if i were to take Asiana Airlines, i'd have to book a separate domestic flight (JFK to BUF) under Delta.


My flight route for Korean Air would be Incheon => Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson (ATL) => Buffalo, while the Asiana-Delta route will be Incheon => JFK => Buffalo.


I'm leaning more towards Asiana Airlines and Delta because it's cheaper overall and i get to try first class (even though it's on a domestic flight lol) for the first time ever.


The only thing i'm worried about now is whether i'd have a problem moving around JFK because i've heard that check-ins and clearing immigration/customs there take forever, especially since i'm an international student travelling on a visa. It's also my first time into the States so i have no idea how the airports there are like.


I'd have slightly over 4 hours layover in JFK, and my main concern is that 4 hours might be a little tight since i'd have to check-out and check-in again if i take Asiana-Delta. On the other hand, i have a 3 hour layover in ATL if i choose Korean Air. I'm also assuming i do not have to check-out and check-in when i'm in ATL since my flights are all operated by Korean Air (even though the ATL-BUF leg is gonna be on a Delta plane).

Has anyone had experience having to check-out and check-in at JFK from an international flight to a domestic one and how was it? Or would it be better if i just booked Korean Air since all the flights from Incheon to Buffalo will be operated under one airline?


Thanks in advance for reading and taking the time to respond! I appreciate any advice :)

Edit 1: added some info.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for your input! I think it's obvious which option i should take now so i'll be booking my flights soon!"

The bullshit is, my local airport does not have a Korean Air office, and my first flight is with Delta to Dallas ft. Worth, which happens to be the nearest Korean air office. Their customer support people were acting like a bunch of asshats, and it seems the only option is for my family member and I to drive all the way to Dallas to get this sorted out, which is about a 6 hour drive.

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

I'm out of college now. Even though the buddy pass (S4) is not an amazing deal, the flexibility is excellent. My life is a little unpredictable and it would be worth it just to be able to cancel if something arose.

I would like to fly to Italy around March 19th, but I am flexible anytime between the 19th and the 26th. I'd like to return mid-April. I can fly out of JFK, Boston, or Bradley. I do understand Bradley would be a pain in the ass, but I'm just mentioning it because I *could* do it. 

I don't care which city I fly into as long as it's on the train network, but either Milan or Rome are ones I've focused on.

The worry has just come up that I might have to deal with completely booked flights in late March. I am of course willing to travel any class (Delta One would be super neato but that's probably a pipe dream).

So I'd really like anyone with experience to tell me if I should book a confirmed flight out and just use a buddy pass for the return or if there's a good chance I'll be able to get a standby seat.

Grazie mille.

edit: willing to sleep in the airport for one night if it came to that. It would suck but it would still be worth it for my circumstances. Ain't gonna live there waiting for a seat though."

This morning at 6 we were at #1 and #2 in the line. Turns out that they ended up overselling every single flight from now until Monday by 15-25 seats, so standby was not happening for us.

I've seen on Delta's site they mention child safety seats and CARES harnesses, but nothing that tells you whether they provide any of these (probably not the car seat). We're currently of the idea we'll have the little on on our laps/walk around etc, but we know she'll totally kick off at some point.

* does the airline supply the seats/harness they mention on their site? (obv she'll need a seat if this is the case).

We have a guest from Australia visiting us in the USA for most of October. She'll make 3 stops in the US. Here's what I'm trying to do:

* SYD to DTW, preferably with the layover at LAX. Stay in Detroit for about a week. Based on my research, this is almost certainly a Delta flight.

* DTW to CLT, for which Delta offers a nonstop, stay a week in that area.

* CLT area airports (3 available) to LAX preferably nonstop so this can't be Delta. Again, stay about a week.

* LAX to SYD.

I want to avoid layovers as much as possible. There seems to be no way to do SYD -> DTW without stopping once, but the rest of the legs can all be done nonstop.

I would like the two overseas flights to be in premium seats, the equivalent of domestic first class, but not the overseas first class that turn into beds. I would like the domestic flights to be the equivalent of Delta's ""Comfort+"" class.

I also don't want to make her pull her (checked) bags back through security at LAX during the first leg of the flight, so that flight seems like it needs to be booked as SYD to DTW with a layover, instead of as two separate flights SYD -> LAX then LAX -> DTW.

The only ideas I have about how to pull this off are:

* Buy a multi-city flight on Delta with legs SYD -> LAX for layover -> DTW, then LAX -> SYD. Buy the other 2 flights as one-way tickets.

* As above, but include the DTW -> CLT flight in the Delta multi-city plan. I would normally use Comfort+ for this, but if it's First because I want the overseas flights to be that, it's not the end of the world.

* Call a travel agent.

47,PSA: Economy Plus is not Premium Economy,8,6t07gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/6t07gm/psa_economy_plus_is_not_premium_economy/,11,2017-08-11 14:12:26,"I work in travel management and we are receiving many complaints from corporate and personal travelers who do not research the differences between these services.

American Main Cabin Extra (MCE), Delta Comfort Plus (Comfort+), United Economy Plus (Economy+) are economy cabin seats with some enhancements, they are not comparable to true premium economy service from airlines such as BA or Lufthansa.

In the last year we have seen several corporations convert from Premium Economy services on European airlines to Economy Plus on American airlines based on ""better pricing"". This is a downgrade. These services are not equal, American MCE can't compare to BA World Traveller Plus, United EconomyPlus can't compare to Lufthansa Premium Economy.

Unfortunately, this is catching out many unfamiliar corporate travellers who are not aware these Economy Plus seats are vastly inferior with much reduced leg room and seat width as well as regular Economy food and drink.

If you do have any say in choosing between these services or influencing your corporate travel agreements, please compare products directly rather than assuming equivalence from names.

Although I always remind any personal travelers I am looking after, not all agents are doing this as our commission is fee and not based on price, so personal travelers used to European standards are also being disappointed after flying the American choices."

I don't see any options while searching for flights on [Cheap Flights](https://www.cheapflights.com/), Google Travel, for assigned seating?  On Delta it looks like you need the Main Cabin seating to be able to choose your seats, which is $400+ compared to $277 for economy, which it states you can't choose seats, on the same flight.

I would have thought they would just assign seats for kids next to parents but they don't even differentiate between child and adult tickets."

My GF flew to america to her aunt for holiday for a month. Her flight was Istanbul-Amsterdam-Mineapolis-San diego. The luggage is lost in her last flight. Mineapolis to San Diego. It was the flight of Delta Airlines I think. But we bought the ticket from KLM Airlines. I think it is called charter flight but Im not sure.

She got a call today and told that they couldn't find it and insurance gonna pay for it. They wanted a list. She is a little sad since it is her first intercontinental flight and she was really excited to go to America.

We have no idea about the flight companies in USA and how the law works.

Do I go to the delta desk at the airport and tell them my situation or do I just not show up for the flight? I don’t know how long this illness would last so I don’t know when I could rebook the flight. It could be a week of illness or merely 1 day. I could also book a one way for a flight on a different airline as well once I feel better so that be a situation. I’m not worried about the cancellation of the rest of the ticket cause this a return leg. I also do not have a checked in bag so I’m not stressed about that. I’m just worried I could be charged a fee for not showing for the last leg.

Ever.,0,4mtnnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/4mtnnv/xpost_from_rtravel_never_flying_delta_again_ever/,9,2016-06-06 19:59:04,"My girlfriend and I booked a round-trip flight from Boston to Orlando for a vacation. The trip was booked months in advance. Prior to our trip I actually called to change our connecting flight in the return leg of the trip (through Laguardia) and was assisted wonderfully by the Delta team. 

However, yesterday, we arrived to MCO at approximately 8:30 AM due to an earlier than expected return from our cruise. Our flight time was not till 15:45 so I attempted to change our tickets to one of two earlier flights to Laguardia (one at 11:45 and one at 13:55). I was told that due to our ticket (Basic Economy) we could not be moved to an earlier flight despite there being room on said flight. While I understand this is in the very fine print of the original purchase (as was incredibly rudely asserted to me on multiple occasions), I explained and begged that I would pay for an upgrade and any additional fee. Instead I was told that if we wanted to get to Boston sooner, we'd have to re-book completely and it would cost $400 per person. 

At this point, we felt defeated and headed to our gate. When we got to our gate, we received notice that our original flight (scheduled for 15:45) was now delayed till 18:45, turning our 7 hour day at the airport into a 10 hour day. Worse yet, this delay would have meant a missed connection at Laguardia, so we needed to completely change flights. 

I went to customer service and was told that NOW there was no longer space on either of the earlier flights and we are being rebooked through Atlanta at 19:30 and arriving to Boston at 00:45 the following day. 

Both of these flights were also delayed, and we left MCO at 20:30, barely making our connection to Boston and arriving at Logan at 1:20 AM on flight DL2300 from Atlanta. 

Had we been rebooked (even at a fee!) at 8:00 AM that morning, none of this would have happened. Every customer service rep at MCO was incredibly rude and dismissive, and when they did try to help they had very little knowledge of the flights available (for example, after being placed on the ATL flight, I was offered to be placed back on the delayed Laguardia flight, despite the fact that doing so would have gauranteed being stuck overnight in New York. Had I not pointed it out MYSELF to the agent at the desk, they would have rebooked us on that flight. 

I sit at work now, having gotten 3.5 hours of sleep last night, our luggage still in Laguardia, after spending 12 hours at MCO and a total of 18 hours trying to get home for Orlando to Boston. 

In that time, I could have driven home faster. Throughout the ordeal I was treated as second-class (sorry, they called it E-class) and never once offered anything (even an apology) for the worst day of my life. 

Sorry, needed to vent. "

Saturday, April 27th, we had our American Airlines flight (executed by British Airways) to London Heathrow, where we had our connecting flight to JFK by American Airlines. Due to Weather conditions (They said so), our flight got delayed, so we couldn’t make it on our second flight to JFK (This flight even departed earlier). We were told to go to the connections desks, which after a long wait told us we had to stay at a hotel and leave the next morning to catch our rebooked Lufthansa flight to Frankfort (FRA). Here we had another connecting flight to JFK from Delta. When we arrived slightly late at Frankfurt Airport we ran to catch our next Delta flight. We didn’t even had the Check-in tickets yet; this caused us to never make in in time and we yet again got us rebooked at a British Airways Helpdesk. At the end, all 4 of us would split up in 2 groups to still arrive at JFK in the evening of Sunday, we insisted in doing it, as our last hope. We went as fast as we could to the Lufthansa Helpdesk to get our tickets, but they said the information provided by British Airways was not complete and the time period was way to narrow to still make the flight. After this huge disappointment we decided to cancel our trip, since our 5 days at New York would turn to 3, which just wouldn’t made it worth it.

With our already more than 24 hours delay, our airline clearly made some big mistakes. Off course we cannot help the first delay (since weather conditions), but getting rebooked twice on flights that were impossible to make (the Lufthansa helpdesk employee that tried to get our tickets confirmed this) is just not right. Now I wondered who is responsible for the mistakes made on our flights; American Airlines or British Airlines and what would be possible in terms of claims or other solutions.

One of the items I am trying to bring over is a $1200+ pc that I can't really afford to ship if at all possible. I am flying Delta, and they give strict guidelines saying it can't be checked into cargo (I had purchased a large, hardshell case for this possibility), but my carryon bag would be flexible enough to fit it. The problem is that the guidelines for a carryon are listed to be 45 linear inches, with the example of 22x14x9. My tower's dimensions are 20x17x8, which is still 45 linear inches, but obviously different than their example.

The problem is, none of those fares seem to be bookable. It's a flight operated by Delta, but those prices seem to either be on Alitalia or KLM. I've tried going directly on the sites to book the flights for a bunch of dates, but it's non-existent. The prices are much higher than shown on Google Flights.

what are the odds that those 2 flights (which are $1011 for AC and $1065 for AF) might be around the same price if I book say April 1.

I'm guessing the price might go up; but I still might be able to find a reasonably flight for around 900 even if it;s 3-4 months prior to the flight. Kinda hard pressed as I'm sure I will be able to get like 10 days off but not sure about 14.

Delta is saying it's the responsibility of the airline that was flying the first leg (non-EU airline). The second leg from AMS is full so I have to keep the crappy seat.

The itinerary was SEA to CDG (Air France) and CDG to MAA (Jet Airways). As many of you may know, Jet Airways went bankrupt, and Air France accommodated me in a different set of flights, but the exact dates were unavailable, so they put me on a flight that departed on Nov. 19. The itinerary was SEA to CDG (Delta) and CDG to MAA (Air India). The exact departure times of the Delta flight from SEA changed many times following this, from 11:44 AM to 12:52 PM and then again to 12:42 PM.

Now, it seems increasingly likely that I may have to make this trip to India much sooner than anticipated (late-August instead of mid-November). What are the most practical options?

1. Will Air France reschedule my itinerary to August without any penalties? My ticket is a refundable ticket with a $135 penalty and a $100 change fee.
2. If option 1 doesn't work out, and if I have to reschedule the dates, will I have to pay the fare difference on top of the change fee? The fare difference is currently in the 1000's of $s.
3. If neither option 1 nor 2 work out, will I be able to cancel without a penalty, considering my original itinerary was set to depart on Nov. 17 and also considering the changed itinerary was further changed multiple times?
4. Are there any other options?

Lastly, I wanted to add that I could not modify the itinerary online, the website displays the following error: ""Your reservation cannot be modified online. For more information please contact your point of sale.""

Thanks for your time!

**EDIT: I received a full refund without the cancelation penalty after 3 calls. The first two didn't agree to cancel without the penalty, while all three laughed in my face for hoping that I would be able to reschedule by three months for free due to a completely irrelevant schedule change. Also, the US call center for Air France handles Delta and KLM customer support as well. Thanks to everyone for your replies!**"

Pretty dumb question but this is my first time with KLM to go to Prague, Czech Republic from Southern California. 

I'm going to be in an Economy seat but I'm confused as which baggage policy I need to follow. From Southern California to layover in Minneapolis to Amsterdam is operated by Delta Airlines. 

From there, Amsterdam to Prague is operated by KLM.

I never really had to pay for my baggage this this kind of sucks but it seems like $25 bucks for Delta and $40 bucks of KLM.

But since my baggage will be checked in the whole time and I won't need it until Prague, hopefully I will only have to pay it once.

Sorry if the question sounds stupid.

Thank you all

So I purchased a three segment ticket from US with a layover in Minneapolis and Amsterdam to Prague. My ticket number starts with KLM but it is operated by Delta Airlines.

So on Delta website, I chose my seats with the windows because I feared that that I might be stuck in middle seats which will be just terrible.

I read on some websites that if you check in or arrive at departure line late, there maybe a chance for you to upgrade if your seating is taken or the tickets are oversold.

I chose the seats because worst comes to worst I will just be in Economy seat with the seating I chose. But I was wondering if I should check in early a day before or check in once I get to the airport.

I'm guessing the best route is check in once I get to the airport, and wait until end of the line to get on the plane. I don't have a specific date to land in Europe anyways. Plus I have to check in a bag anyways so I guess it won't make a difference.

I know there is like a very slim chance, but why I wondered why not try it. 

Thank you all

I also upgraded to the economy preferred because that was one of the only seat configurations that was just 2 people in our row area. Regular economy only had 3 or 4 person per row area configuration. 

So I made the purchase a while ago, got the confirmation, saw the charge on my card and was done. A few days later I noticed the money was returned to my card. Worried we had lost our seats, I log into delta, but our seats are still confirmed. 

I think I need to call delta and confirm this all over again and maybe pay them again but my buddy is telling me that I'll be charged at check in or that I got the seats for free since I'm a (really low level) reward member. 

Can someone with experience purchasing seat upgrades like this give me any feedback?"

So my boyfriend was searching on Google Flights and when he found the date that works for him, he booked it on the Delta website. And because it was straight from Google Flights, he never thought of checking it coz he have booked with Google Flights before. Only when he saw the email confirmation that he saw/realized(??) the wrong date. 

He was supposed to get to SFO Sunday evening and come back to ATL on a Monday morning but the date was that he would arrive Sunday morning on ATL instead. 

The link he got was the cheapest one where you can't choose your seat. I'm not really sure if this applies but is the 24h cancellation thing gonna work here because he only bought it last night? He already cancelled it this morning and purchase a new ticket with his Delta Miles. Is there any way we can get him a refund even if its gonna be on miles?

Sorry if this is a little stupid of a question. It's just sad if that 300 bucks will go to waste. Thanks

Our 8pm flight wound up getting delayed until the next morning because the inbound flight crew couldn't land in time. The Delta gate agents handled this perfectly!

* They kept most passengers in the terminal, rather than on the aircraft. Even compared to a roomy 330 (to say nothing of a CRJ), the terminal is MUCH more comfortable.
* They wheeled out carts with free snacks and water. Nothing fancy, just your typical in-flight snacks ... but very much appreciated.
* Every gate agent was able to handle the situation. You don't know how big of a deal this is. Instead of waiting in the 15+ people line at our gate, I was able to find a gate agent who appeared to be not busy (no aircraft at her gate, no people in her area) and asked if she could help. She was happy to!
* They were not only able to book us on a much later (same night) flight to an airport near our final destination, but they were able to keep our seat upgrades. Fantastic! We wound up renting a car and driving the 100 miles home, but it just made our anniversary trip into an adventure.
* Our bags actually made it onto our new aircraft. This is the part that always makes me nervous with last-second flight changes, but our bags were waiting for us at our new destination!
* Best of all, the crew remained calm and helpful. Nobody was happy with the situation, but they did the best they could.

I know we see a ton of complaints in here so I wanted to do something a little different and give a huge shout out to the DTW Delta staff working the storms last Wednesday night!

Also, this was my first time flying through DTW. I've got to say it was not at all what I expected. It has a very comfortable ""small town airport"" feel but was actually huge."

  13 hours is kinda awkward - it's long but most people I've spoken to think it isn't long enough to warrant leaving the airport to sleep in a hotel, so I'm planning on staying in the airport overnight. I've been looking at lounges to spend most of the time in (only found 1 24 hour lounge) but they're past security, and I don't know if I'll be in departures for the night?

  Basically I'm really confused - will I have to check out my luggage and check back in again? And if I do, does that mean I can't access any lounges during my layover? since (I assume) you can't check in for a flight 13 hours before it! I've tried googling for an answer but so far the only answer I've found is 'It depends'.

In November I booked flights to India via Delta for spring break. I’m a student and this year of my studies is very busy, so this is the only time I have. Because of that, I paid more to book with Delta under the impression they would be available to correct problems if they arise. I was only going to be here for 7 days and I’m didn’t want to spend it on the phone with the airline. Two weeks before I arrived, my grandfather passed away. I was both crushed and relieved I’d be here to support my grandmother and help around the house. I just want to spend my remaining time here doing the small things that make family so precious like seeing her and talking to her.

Unfortunately, Delta and Jet Airways have other plans for my time here. Jet Airways cancelled my flight back on Saturday, I only know this because my dad is attempting to get a flight home and asked to be on the same flight as me, Jet Airways told him they can’t do that because the flight is gone. I haven’t received any email notification of this cancellation from Delta or Jet Airways, nor is this information available in the Delta app. They also told him there are no other flights back on Saturday, so to arrive in time to being my classes, I would have to leave a day earlier - cutting my 7 day trip to 6. I am of course very sad about this, but I understand that things happen and sometimes you get the short end of the stick on that.

Which brings me to my problem. My dad, recognizing that I would need new flights, asked the folks at Jet Airways to help him rebook the flights while we were at the airport (a 3 hour trip from my grandmother’s home). They said they cannot rebook any part of the trip because I booked it via Delta. So, I contacted Delta via twitter DMs. (It would be 50 cents per minute to call Delta, which could get astronomical with this issue and the notorious customer service hold). They told me they will rebook me to be with my dad, but that I need to contact Jet Airways to get my flight with them rebooked. When I call the Jet Airways number, no one picks up the phone and, as I said, the person I spoke with in person said he quite literally could not change the booking. Even if I wanted to talk to him again, I’d have to go 3 hours by car. After 3 hours of trying to get Delta to do something, they sent a message saying I needed to contact Jet Airways “for my protection” and that there was “no where further to escalate the issue.”

While I’m certainly honored that Delta had the CEO himself DM me on Twitter, I’m also feeling quite stuck. As you can imagine, I can’t afford to just pay for a new flight at the last minute (especially with ticket prices skyrocketing from other problems with Jet Airways), I don’t want to spend my remaining few days spending quality time with airline customer service representatives, and I do very much need to be home to continue my studies. 

Any advice is much appreciated. Good advice is preferred.

I've done some research, but I'm still not entirely sure how this will affect my trip and would appreciate if someone could help clarify a few main points. Primarily:

1. How will this affect my baggage? (ie. will I need to go to baggage claim in LAX and recheck everything in since it will be with different airlines, or can I still have it follow me straight from BNA?)
2. If my BNA -> LAX flight is delayed/canceled (or NRT -> LAX on the return) and I am not able to reach the next flight in time, will the airline(s) still work with me to get me on another flight?
3. Depending on the answers to the previous questions, will a 3 hour layover in LAX be too tight/risky? I don't fly often and I'm not familiar with LAX so I'm hoping someone with some more experience could give some advice.

Checked baggage cannot be retrieved en-route or at connecting cities.

If you are returning from an international itinerary, you will clear
U.S. Customs at the first point of entry into the United States.""

But seeing as I'm flying in from Asia, I figured that my baggage would be pulled from inspection. I've only ever flown out of the US to Asia, but not back in. Do they do U.S. Customs checks at Incheon airport?

Thanks in advance for the advice! "

I was a loyal Virgin America customer. But now that the Alaska merger has made it less appealing, I'm thinking about just switching over to United Gold. Mostly because United has great route coverage from my home airport at SFO. I also travel internationally quite a bit and Star Alliance Gold also would be of great use to me.

I've looked at Delta and AA as well. Delta's route coverage from SFO is worse than Alaska. AA is also less of a hub from SFO and has less international rewards.

Any United Gold members that can recommend for the program? Also open to hearing why United's not a great option. Alaska seems fine but doesn't really live up to Virgin or give many perks for international travel."

Meanwhile, where I'm living has it's own airport (Burlington, VT) which usually has fairly cheap flights. 

Current plan for this year is to fly into Phoenix and drive to the ski areas in southern Colorado. This would be sometime in mid march. Just in general, I'm wondering if it would be better to A. Take a flight out of Burlington (either JetBlue or Delta) and deal with baggage costs,or B. Drive down to one of the other airports and take Southwest."

I've done some searching on this subreddit and other online forums but can't seem to find a straightforward answer. Perhaps someone can help offer some clarity?

I'm in the process of moving back to the US after a few years living in Europe. As such, I'm looking at one way plane tickets from Europe to the US. However, I noticed that it would be $200-300 cheaper to buy a *roundtrip* ticket (Europe>US, then 5 days later US>Europe). Obviously, I could just not show up for the return portion of the flight, but I'm worried about potential penalties that I keep reading about.

Specifically, this roundtrip ticket is with Delta. According to their [ticket rules & regulations](https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/planning-a-trip/booking-information/fare-classes-and-tickets/ticket-rules-restrictions.html), ""Throw-away ticketing - use of discounted round-trip excursion fares for one-way travel ""is a prohibited practice and could result in being charged "" for the difference between the fare paid and the fare for the passenger's traveled itinerary."" 

I've read on some posts that in practice, penalties are only given for people who systematically abuse this option. Does anyone have more direct knowledge on whether I should be worried about receiving a penalty?

I was going to check a duffel, leave the terminal, pick it up, and come back inside and check it again with Norwegian. I'm studying abroad for 6 months and having that third bag with me would make packing MUCH better.

Right now, round trip flights from PHX --> NRT are about $1200-$1300 (up from $900 when we first found out.) Delta wants $1600-$1900 for what was $900 a week or so ago.

However, the same legs of the trip purchased separately are less than $1000 (closer to $900)

I was wondering if it would be against the rules to book a roundtrip from PHX to SEA and another roundtrip from SEA to NRT? As far as I can tell the rules seem to be mostly about buying tickets for trips I don't intend to take, but I don't fly often so I'm uncertain.

I went on, found flights at $223 a piece with Delta, loaded them in my cart, entered passenger info, selected seats, and as I progressed to the next screen for payment, tickets jumped to $373 and there was nothing I could do about it. I see the entire weekend jumped up so I'm guessing I was 5 minutes too late, and the airlines realized it was Wrestlemania weekend. 

So my question for you guys is, extending out an extra day put me at $310 - $315 which is still better, but not what I was a click away from. Factoring in the weekend, do you think this is a price ceiling for now? I found this sub and thought someone here might know trends better than I. Should I wait this out or just jump on the $310 price. I've seen tickets fluctuate so I know it can go down, I just don't want it to continue going up.

I bought a nonstop flight on Student Universe MSP-CDG to study aborad. I purchased the ticket as branded Air France but it was a Delta codeshare. Delta operated the flight as AF does not fly directly to MSP in the winter. I knew this going in but saved about $75 buying the AF version of the ticket. Had no issues, could verify my reservation on AF website. 24 hour window opens up and AF directs me to check in on Delta website. Delta tells me I have to check in at the airport. I call them to make sure everything is okay, they assure me its fine. When I get to the airport I can't check in at the normal check in counter,  have to go to the special services desk. The agent is able to verify that I am supposed to be on the flight and that I do indeed have a seat but tells me several times ""I can see the air france reservation, I just cant access it."" I have no idea what this means but she can't give me a boarding pass or check me in. She gets on the phone and furiously tapps on the computer for about 20 minutes. Checking in takes forever but I eventually get checked in and on the flight.  I figure its a Student Universe problem, but this proves to not be true.

My bf bought a United branded and United operated flight ORD-CDG through Student Universe and had absolutly no problems. he was able to check in online, verify his passport information, drop his bag without issue. A friend visits me and has the same exact iteanrry as the bf through Student Universe and also has no problems.

My family makes plans to visit me in France. They get a great deal through KLM's website for MSP-AMS-CDG and back and they are lifelong skymiles members. They bought directly with KLM, on the phone no less. All of their flights were either Delta or AF, they never flew KLM so several of their flights were codeshares within the skyteam alliance as mine was. When they get to the airport they have the same problem as me, the desk agent can view and confirm their reservations, but she can't access them/give them boarding passes/take their bags etc. They go through the same long process as I do, eventually getting on the plane but this time the culprit can't be Student Universe. I even bought a Delta branded Delta operated flight on Student Universe from CDG-MSP to return from study aborad and I had no issues so it seems like the codeshares between the skyteam alliance is the problem here. Edit: should mention on my family's travel back to the US they had no issues checking in. 

So I'm curious if anyone else has had this issue? What is the point of a codeshare if it is difficult to use?I have since avoided codeshares and probably will in the future unless the price is drastically different (and I know they can be), but I am wondering if we did something wrong that cn be fixed or if this is a skyteam issue?"

I work in Deadhorse, Alaska but live in Knoxville, Tennessee so I'm flying a round-trip every six weeks. I just started a new job and with my old job, I could purchase my own flights all the way to Deadhorse with miles and then the company would reimburse us, so I was only paying about 200 for a round trip but my new job doesn't offer this so I'll be just flying from Anchorage to Knoxville so there isn't a huge need for gaining my miles with Alaska Airlines, so with that and also w delta recently dropping alaska as a partner, it seems it might be best to look elsewhere but at the same time I love that alaska gives you points for miles flown unlike most other airlines where it is per dollar spent. I'm not someone who searches out different airlines for greater service, I'm solely looking for the cheapest ticket. So I'll be mostly flying between Anchorage alaska and Knoxville Tennessee with the occasional out of the country trip, so I was curious which alliance you think I should choose??

Well, now I have no idea if the bag actually arrived on the Aeromexico flight because airlines only have agents at ZIH if there is a flight within a small time frame.

I called Delta Baggage in Atlanta and they can't see updates to my bag anymore because they handed my bag off to Aeromexico. Like what the hell, man? They had multiple flights from LAX to ZIH yet they gave my bag to another airline and can't track me anymore? I paid Delta to get my bag to me through their airline.

Yesterday (May 19) I flew on a Delta flight that was operated by WestJet. I checked my bag with WestJet and that they are who printed the baggage sticker. It's a WestJet number. The flight was WS 1100 from Toronto to Los Angeles. The flight was meant to be a layover, and then today I flew from LAX to Ixapta/Zihuantenjo (Mexico) on a Delta operated flight DL 645.

When I arrived in LAX yesterday, my bag never came out of the turnstile. Toronto was the last I saw it. I notified both WestJet and Delta (who are right beside each other at LAX) but neither cared and didn't ultimately know who was responsible for it, and how to proceed, or how the bag even goes from Toronto ultimately to Mexico. Yesterday, one lady at Delta baggage services (LAX) told me my bag would ultimately end up in Mexico today , since the flight to LAX was a layover. Still she couldn't actually verify this. That was really the only attempt at an answer I got.

Well today came and when I got off the DL 645 there was no bag here in Mexico.

My question is how do I proceed with this? Neither Delta or WestJet knows how to track it. I don't even know if it made it from Toronto to Los Angeles on WS 1100, let alone from LA to Mexico today.

Please. Anything would help.

About two weeks ago, I purchased a ticket on Delta Airlines through Kayak. Everything was fine, up until New Years Eve - the day before my flight. On New Years Eve, I attempted to check-in to my flight and received an error message saying I had to check-in at a kiosk. Now nervous about my ticket, I decided to travel to the airport at 10:30pm on New Years Eve to make sure everything was okay. Upon arrival, I entered my flight details into a kiosk, as I was earlier told to do, and received another error message: Please see a Ticketing Agent. 

Now I was very worried so I decide to call Delta customer service. At first, I was told my ticket was ""randomly selected"" in a control process, and I must bring my credit card that I used to purchase my ticket to the kiosk in order to get my tickets. Problem is... I had just received a new credit card in the mail two days ago and didn't have the original. I told the representative this, and he said it would be fine, as long as I have my driver's license on my person. But the explanation sounded fishy to me... and I was still nervous.

So I called Delta customer service again and this time got a supervisor. The supervisor told me my purchase was flagged as fraud by their internal fraud team **during the 5 minutes I spent purchasing the ticket through Kayak. How odd is that??** For that reason, I must bring my original credit card to the counter in order to get my tickets ... which I don't have. After spending nearly 1.5 hours dealing with this on New Years Eve... the supervisor refunded and reissued my ticket on my new card.

However the issue still remains ... ***what if I hadn't been suspicious of Delta's initial explanation***? I wouldn't have been able to get on my flight. Their security requirement of bringing the original card for suspected fraudulent transactions initially sound reasonable. But what if this had been a family member purchasing a ticket for their child in another state? Or a similar situation of someone who recently got a new credit card? Anyone could easily miss a trip they had already paid for because of this. Worse yet, if Delta wants to put their customers through a ""fraud review"", shouldn't they have more information about their customer than a three minute on-line purchase with Kayak? Shouldn't they have an obligation to notify the customer with a huge advisory notice on their ticket confirmation that additional credit card information is needed at the airport to validate travel?

Posting on here to see if anyone else has experienced this.

Let me get this out of the way first, I made a poor decision in my haste to try and save some money, and should have done things differently. With that out of the way (please don't let me know I should have done it differently, I understand that already), here's my question:

I recently booked a flight through JustFly.com that won't be until May. I'm pretty sure about the dates, but there's a very slim chance that things might happen that would make it not work to travel then. Wanted to book early though to try and get a better deal, since if the things happen they wouldn't be happening till like a week before the scheduled flight at the earliest. So, I did what I thought was smart and bought the ""Extended Cancellation Policy,"" thinking that it would give me flexibility to cancel the flight if something came up.

I misread the policy, and turns out it just means that you can can cancel within 24 hours of *purchase* without paying the extra JustFly fees. I thought it meant I'd be able to cancel up to 24 hours from the flight date.

Okay, all that aside, my question is, is there any way to try and negotiate directly with the airline (it's Delta in this case) in the event that I need to try and move the flight? Or am I locked into whatever JustFly wants to do with it? Basically I'm in a position where it's 95% certain that the dates I booked will work just fine, but there's that slim possibility that a week or less before the flight, something could crop up that'll make it not possible to leave then. Do I just need to cross my fingers real hard or is there anything I might be able to do?"

One leg of the trip was from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale.. naturally the flight was overbooked and they sought volunteers to give up their seats. After a short delay they had their volunteers (no dragging on this flight!) and we started boarding. 

I found out pretty quickly that our seats sucked.. last row right by the bathrooms. Not my first time sitting there so not a huge deal. Then out of the blue the vent above the aisle started leaking water...and not a drip here and there... it was a pretty considerable amount of water and it was pouring right onto aisle seat that my sister was seated in. We brought this to the attention of the flight attendants and one of them told us that it wasn't the first time that day that it happened and that the mechanics just never fix that issue... Clearly eager to get everyome seated the other flight attendant (in charge?) told us that the flight was overbooked and that if we ""didn't want to fly with them (us)"" we could get off. After some complaining said flight attendant found a crewmember catching a ride back elsewhere and profusely apologized to him (but nevee to us) before asking him to switch seats with my sister. On the way out my sister thanked the crewmember who switched seats with her. Seeing this the FA must have expected a thank you as well because when she didn't get one she blurted out ""not even a thank you?"". 

That's my story. Just wanted to share my bad experience. Bonus photo ""fix"" the delta crew implemented to help with the issue short term.. it looks funny but it was a lot more than the rude flight attendant seemed to be willing to do.

1. Can I get Delta to link my KAL flight to my Delta account so that my checked bag can be transferred to my KAL flight?
2. If no to the previous question, does anyone know if baggage claim at ICN is before or after customs/security?

I'm a decently seasoned flier but this is the first time I am considering flying with our dog. We have a 14 year young puppy that is entering the twilight of his journey. We are visiting family during Christmas this year and would like to bring him along. I've already gotten the Sherpa carrier which I understand partners with several airlines and I'm not too concerned about that (we are currently training him to stay still in the bag). However, since he is advanced in age, I worry about the vaccinations requirement. His vaccinations have lapsed and I am not interested in putting him through any potential issues at his age.

1. Some airlines are explicit about requirements (JetBlue for example said on their website they don't require paperwork for domestic travel) but others are very vague. Anyone have experiences traveling with Delta or AA?

2. NY State (where I live) requires inbound animals to have proof of vaccinations. Is that enforced?

I understand the safe thing to do is to have him vaccinated or leave him at home but I'd like to bear from this community if I have any options. 

Thanks."

232,Help cancelling flight to Puerto Rico,7,74j6fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/74j6fp/help_cancelling_flight_to_puerto_rico/,2,2017-10-06 01:38:58,"My SO and I bought tickets on Frontier for an upcoming wedding in San Juan total fair of $1076(PHL-SJU)(4 PAX) this was in August, before Maria was even on the radar. 

_

Because of the devastation, the venue cancelled and the wedding has been postponed TBD. Frontier wants to charge us $400 in change fees to get a voucher for our flights and refuses to cancel/refund because the flight takes place after Oct 8th.

I have a cancellation letter from the venue if that helps.

Any advice for dealing with Frontier?

PS it's worth noting every other guest that purchased tickets via Delta, United, SW, etc. was able to get their tickets **refunded** without issue. "
233,Delta JFK Terminal 4 Lounge Access,0,7yizk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/7yizk2/delta_jfk_terminal_4_lounge_access/,2,2018-02-19 04:17:00,"A friend and I are flying to Paris in a couple of months, and have a 7 hour layover at JFK. We're coming in on separate Delta flights since we're coming from different destinations. I've got the Gold Delta Amex, so I can get us into Delta's lounge at Terminal 4. However, we're flying on an Air France flight we booked together from terminal 1. Does anyone know whether we'll be able to get back into terminal 4 after we grab our bags to go to the lounge for a few hours?      
We went ahead and linked our reservations through Delta's customer service, but they said they couldn't guarantee whether they could check our bags through to Paris. "
234,Is ATC responsible for everything that goes wrong?,0,68mam2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/68mam2/is_atc_responsible_for_everything_that_goes_wrong/,2,2017-05-01 18:32:53,"I am stuck in JFK because my Delta flight was not able to get to the gate due to a previous flight from the same carrier having not vacated the gate. To add to it, I was forced to go between terminals using a shuttle service which operates based on head count instead of following fixed timetables. Now I am waiting for my next flight which is also delayed. When I asked the flight agent at the counter, he blamed it all on the ATC. I am naive and dont know how ATC works but I feel throwing blame on ATC is simply a strategy to not do their responsibility of making sure connections are made on time and are doable. "

Further background: I initially booked non-stop to NRT, but the route was canceled and I was rebooked on flights with a connection. This itinerary has been problematic, to say the least. "

I am flying from Detroit to Amsterdam in a couple weeks on an A330-300. I am a tall person and too broke to upgrade to comfort plus or anything, so every extra inch is a Godsend. I’ve been looking at the seat maps and notice that towards the back of the plane the config goes from 2-4-2 to 2-3-2. I’m thinking of taking a seat in the first row of 2-3-2 as it looks like I’ll have a little more room on the side then a 2-4-2 row. Does anyone have any experience in those seats? Does the tv line up to my seat with the seat in front of me? Any information would be helpful. Thanks! "

I realized after the free cancel deadline that I need to change my reservations. I called Expedia and was told that all reservations are non refundable and it'll cost me $400 to cancel or $400 to book a new flight. I'm starting to loose my mind a bit. I still plan to go on my trip but I need to move the dates. Ultimately I don't mind letting the airlines keep my money as long as the dates can be changed, and if I have to pay the difference I suppose that's fine too. However, paying the cost of the flight to cancel my flight is plain highway robbery. Is there anyone I can call, something I can do? Please help!"

She has tourist visa, limited experience with airports, and doesn't speak English.

My understanding is that she has to claim her baggage, pass Customs & Borders, then go to Delta to check-in the baggage again, and then go to the gate. That sounds like quiet a lot of stuff for 2 hours, what do you think? Any info I should give her to help her with this connection?"
