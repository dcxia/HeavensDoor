9,Airbus and Bombardier Announce C Series Partnership,181,76u9t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/76u9t0/airbus_and_bombardier_announce_c_series/,131,2017-10-17 02:44:39,"That went quickly from rumours of Bombardier looking to sell off CRJ/Q400 to an Airbus partnership for C-Series. Wonder this will do with respect to the ongoing trade dispute regarding the Delta order. 





**Edits**

A related article from CNN which includes this interesting tidbit (kudos to /u/dubbltrubbl/ 


> While the deal at its outset is a three-way tie up, the legalese of the deal's announcement allows Bombardier and Quebec to exit the program in 2023, selling their stakes to Airbus in the years to come.
""At the end of the day, this is going to be an Airbus program,"" said Rainer Ohler, vice president of communications for Airbus Group in an interview. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018.> 

http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/16/news/companies/airbus-buys-majority-stake-bombardier-cseries/index.html

and a comment from Boeing

> ""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government. Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,"" a Boeing spokesman said in a statement.> 

So based on everything this is basically an almost no risk steal for Airbus; and while they tried sorting out a deal a while back it seems now that the thing is flying and proving to pan out they were interested again.


There is also a bit more detail in this Globe & Mail article (note: paywall) but I've highlighted one item below I didn't see anywhere; also corrected a mistake in the article:

> Bombardier will continue to fund the plane's early production through the limited partnership as well as any cash shortfalls up to $700-million over the first three years of the deal. ~~Boeing~~ ***Airbus*** also obtains warrants for 100 million subordinate voting shares in C Series parent Bombardier Inc. and the right to buy Bombardier's stake in the partnership at a later date

My height can best handle that section and it's not as pricey as going up to business or first.

My close friend’s dad is a pilot for Delta and so I was interested in knowing what’s it’s like to be a pilot. He started off by telling me that flight school is really expensive (he went to embry riddle). He also told me before becoming a pilot you have to see if you like flying in general and to try flying with a flight instructor for like $100 solo. Tbh I RARELY see women who are pilots these days and I was wondering why that is & how hard it is to become one in general. I also worry a lot about my future if I become a pilot. Here are some questions I have:

1. Will I get to spend time with my family? 
2. How long will it take me until I start flying commercial? 
3. How can I raise my kids if I’m gonna be gone? 
4. Will I get super lonely on trips?  
5. Do you need a bachelors degree to go to flight school? 
6. Is flight school stressful & hard?
7. Is it true that women in aviation move up the ladder quickly? 
8. Is it too late to start wanting to become a pilot? 

If anyone could answer some of my questions, that would be great! Even if you could only answer one question, I still would appreciate any input if you know anything about women in aviation or have more information about this. I know some people my age who are already completing their private pilots license, but I have no $ or experience whatsoever :("

First leg was Las Vegas to Atlanta and I'm currently 35,000 ft up on my second leg to Germany. 

I love that the employees look professional, the accommodations on the flights, the quality of the seats, leg room (though my international flight isn't so good). But in all I am just so impressed by this airline. And prior to flying today I never heard negative things about them, the price was just always a bit too steep... But I get it now. 

On top of all that I looked into their history and business model and again am impressed.

My company uses Delta for business travel and am so happy they do. Props to any of you who work for them."

I don’t care if it’s “the South” — this isn’t something that happens at any other major US airport when there’s minor winter weather. ATL is key to US transport and aviation — if the people in Atlanta can’t manage minor weather without canceling flights, the federal government should get involved and force them to learn. Absurd "

Last year I flew 48 times in 52 weeks and only one of them was a good flight (I sat next to an off-duty Delta pilot and we talked the whole time about how safe flying is). 

I've tried everything to help. Sleep meds don't help. Self-help books don't help. My mother saying, ""you know, flying is much safer than driving!"" doesn't help. 

I know it's an irrational fear. And obviously I don't let it keep it keep me from living life, but man I'd like to enjoy it. I'm just a complete wreck (inwardly. I don't freak out and cause a scene.) Takeoff is the worst.

My fears are probably based on a slight fear of heights, claustrophobia, and not being in control (you know... like sitting in the back seat of a car and wanting to push the brakes when you see the car in front of you slow down). 

One thing I constantly do is worry that an engine is just going to blow up because it's so gosh damn powerful and spinning like mad. Seriously... their power scares the hell out of me. 

Not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just some calming anecdotes from you pilots. One thing that does calm me down a lot is watching cockpit videos and seeing how normal and relaxed the pilots are. It really is ultra-safe. 

Also... eff turbulence.

Thanks guys."

If the city of Atlanta really cared about its citizens, it wouldn't let Delta dominate this major airport like a fiefdom. If Delta left Atlanta, so what? ATL would still be a decent facility and fares would plummet as low-cost airlines occupied former gates dominated by Delta. 

&#x200B;

Sure, Delta provides a few jobs for Atlanta residents, but it mostly just dominates ATL -- in a grossly corrupt way (look at the way Qatar was treated) -- and punishes everyone who doesn't work for Delta with insane airfares. And given Atlanta is really in the middle of nowhere, with no rail connections, the only option people living there have is to fly. "

What are some of the aircraft that I haven't been on yet and need to before they start to either be retired or just haven't been on ever before and want to?

I'm 28 and have been in love with planes for 23 of those. The 747 is the one plane I absolutely must fly on, and my chances at that are getting slimmer by the day. I'd love to fly on one of the new Dreamliners, but I have a real big problem recognizing or appreciating any non-Boeing planes, besides an A380. Maybe it's the numbering scheme that I can't get a grasp on?

Are there any planes that I'm just missing and under appreciating that are a ""must fly"" for someone who just really loves flying? And are there ways to find flights that use specific aircraft types? I know United has a site for people interested in flying on a 787, but if I take a 747 somewhere (for example) i'd want to fly the best way I could (so... probably not an American carrier like Delta or United, no?)"

I am seriously thinking about becoming a pilot, and am looking to getting my commercial pilots license. I am a bit nervous as this is the next big step of my life, and hoping you guys can answer a couple of questions. 

1. First off, is this is a good time to get a job as a pilot? I will graduate from college in june 2015, and enroll in flying school right after I graduate, and expect get my license by 2016, how is the job outlook looking?. Is the job market horrible? or is projected to get better? 

2. Realistically, after I graduate from college, and full time focus just on getting my license, how soon can I expect to get my license, and enter the job market? I understand that one can has to get the cpl license and the atp license and then only can enter the job market right?. 

3. Are flying for commercial airlines like Southwest, and Delta one of the most sough after options. Are there any other options that are very good, but are not sought after. Are flying commerical airlines sought after, because they are lucrative? 

4. And finally, I understand flying school is really expensive. But, as its my passion, I am willing to go through it, even though it will be financial burden. My family is very poor, and thus cannot be of much help. So, I would be looking at taking out loans for the whole process. How much realistically can I expect the total loans would be for the whole process- from getting my license  to enter the job market. 

Also, any reccomendations for flying schools in Orange County, California, as it would be the most convenient here. Thank you so much guys!, and you guys have no idea how grateful I would be be if you guys help me here. I really appreciate it!. "

That being said i was looking at the hubs for the Majors and the only airline that has a hub at my local airport (KPDX) is Alaskan. 

Does this mean that if I want to live in this area for the rest of my life I will only be able to fly for Alaska? Could i potentially be a Delta pilot and live near Portland? 

Someone please clear this up for me, thanks."

It was a late flight and come I'm at 11PM. When we landed, I noticed we taxied to the D gates which housed the Spirit Gates but the pilot passed through and and comntinued to make a loop and enter into the E Terminal and park at a Delta gate. The Whole terminal was Delta Exclusive. Why did this happen? My guess if the gates for spirit were all occupied and they parked it at a Delta Terminal for the time being. Moving it once the first morning flight leaves. Any guesses?"

But, I thought I would share this little piece of history as things we learned from this crash helped make flying a little safer.

Today, August 2nd, marks 30 years since the crash of Delta Air Lines 191, FLL-DFW. The aircraft, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar (reg. N276DA), was carrying 163 people (152 passengers, 11 crew). Flight 191 crashed just short of runway 17L due to windshear resulting from a [microburst](http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/tstorms_article_img3.jpg). 

The aircraft touched down nearly 2 miles ahead of 17L and skidded along the ground. Flight 191 lifted up once more, before falling right back down. The TriStar careened through State Highway 114, impacting a vehicle with its left engine, before finally colliding into two water tanks. The front and center sections of the aircraft exploded into flames as the tail section, now separated, slid along the ground. 

134 occupants perished, along with the occupant of the car on Hwy 114. Nearly all survivors were located in the tail section.

Due to this crash, we made huge advancements in windshear detection technology and subsequently saw widespread adoption of Dopplar radar at airports.
