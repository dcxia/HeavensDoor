What airlines do you recommend? Or what airlines do you recommend as a good airline to get my feet wet, or at least in the air? Not some super strict I'll lose my job airline. These are the airlines I've applied to:
United- had a f2f 6 months ago, so my time is coming back around
Frontier-rejected
Republic-VI (didn't do)
Virgin America- VI rejected
Delta- VI Archived.. Whatever that means
American Airlines- rejected
Skywest- couldn't make the hiring fair
Horizon- f2f rejected
Alaska- f2f rejected (but told me they'd recommend me to Horizon.. not sure if they meant recommend to apply or recommend me to the hiring team)

Edit: I currently work at a bank and have a wrist tattoo so I understand professionalism but not sure if that plays a factor in deciding airlines.
 
Also I've heard Omni and Envoy are good airlines"

Ive been doing the math, and to be able to afford my rent, car, bills, etc. I need to make $50k a year. Picking up extra trips, and possibly working a side job do you see this as a possibility as a first year FA? And if so, how do you recommend doing it?

Basically, I want flights that are as long as possible, with trips that are as long as possible being my second concern. After that, my preference would be international over domestic. I don't really care about weekends off. What are the other variables we can bid on?

Also, how do you trade/drop/pick up trips? I understand that there is a system called Open Time, but what is it like? How do I signal that I want to drop my A days, for instance? I know I won't be able to drop them at first when I have no seniority, but how do I even go about trying? Is there any harm to listing them as something I want to drop? I'm thinking if no one picks them up, I just work them, which I would have had to do anyway, right? Is there a downside to listing them as something someone else could pick up if they want?

Would anyone be willing to post screenshots of the systems Delta uses for bidding and swapping? With personal information blocked out, of course.

Darn, but as it was my first attempt, I'm not totally heartbroken.  However my heart is really set on working with American Airlines as a flight attendant, and I totally plan on applying again when the next opportunity arises, but I need to look at my other options as well. What can I do in the meantime? 

&#x200B;

I'm definitely applying for other airlines and keeping an eye out for when Delta and United start hiring (for more than just a bilingual position). I have no experience as a flight attendant, and find myself wondering if I could get experience with another airline - would that make me more desirable as an applicant? Since Mesa airlines have a partnership with American and United is there a possibility of that being a good step in the door? 

&#x200B;

Or would it maybe be better to go another route by applying for a different Job with American? Getting my name and work ethic out there and known within the company, and so when there's later on a chance to apply for my desired job they know who I am, and I am doing so internally. I see that they have a Customer Assistance Representative position open, and as I have several years of customer service under my belt this wouldn't be a hard jump to make.

Help Please!,0,8xgbye,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/8xgbye/applying_as_a_flight_attendant_for_delta_vs/,13,2018-07-10 01:15:11,"Hey guys! I am looking to apply as a flight attendant for either Delta, American, or United. I'm trying to figure out which airline would be the best for me to work for, and wondered what the differences are between the three that I should be most aware of, especially as a newbie FA. I would greatly appreciate your expertise and advice as professionals in the field. :)

My plan was to apply for these companies in the fall when (I thought...) the three applications would all open at around the same time, but United just opened, so I have slightly less time than I thought to mull this all over. 

Questions I have:

1. Differences between Delta, American, and United I should consider in choosing? (Salaries, Unions, Scheduling, Time off, etc and more I wouldn't think of yet)
2. Benefits of Unionizing vs not (as I know Delta is not unionized)
3. Which airline would it be easiest to get a base out of California with? (I am definitely willing to move, but if I can be based in CA with easier access to friends and family that would be the dream.) 
4. I am a German major, and have fairly high conversational German, though I hesitate to call myself fluent- Is it worth trying to apply as Language of Destination/Bilingual? Can I apply to both bilingual and normal positions, or do I only get one application per airline?
5. (United Specific) The application for United that just opened is showing for Chicago- would it be basically guaranteed I would be placed in Chicago (initially at least)? 
6. Odds of starting out with international flights rather than domestic? (I am an International Studies major and dying to get back out into the world again:) 
7. Anything I should do to bolster my application/resume? 
   1. I have so far: Double degree in International Studies and German, a year and a half experience living in Europe with a lot of travel experience, German and Spanish Intermediate/Advanced language skills, working as a waitress now to get more customer service experience, and I am about to take an adult and pediatric CPR/AED/First Aid class.

Thank you so much to anyone who has taken the time to read this and answer any questions!! 

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who answered my questions! You guys have been so helpful. "

How long does it usually take for United to contact you after the video interview?

I am a male, 21, in Chicago (o'hare/midway are both the same distance from me) and my contract for my work-at-home job just expired, and after being strapped to home for so long I'm feeling very interested in being a flight attendant as a career forward.

I'm sure this question gets asked a lot (and I've seen male F/As on my flights before, so I'm sure it's not an actual issue), but is being a male an *obstacle* for being considered? Do I need to standout more as a male to be considered? Or is it about the same? I know there's a stereotype (recently-crumbling) that F/As are females, but I'm just curious on any experience some may have on this.

I love flying, I have 3 years of volunteer (read: no referral) customer service (Xbox Ambassador Program - take chats/calls.. volunteer based..), 1 year of actual work with them (Microsoft Consultant, referral might be doable), but I am unsure how valuable these are as they're chat- and call- jobs and not really face to face.

Due to my previously very at-home jobs I don't have ""dress clothes"", would these be worth investing in if I chase this line? I have plain black clothes but nothing in the line of say, a suit, or such. 

Hair! I have pretty long (manbun) hair right now and I read that they have strict appearance guidelines. I'm assuming this means maintaining my longer hair is out of the question, and I'm more than fine with parting ways with it should I get the position - but can I keep it for the interview and deal with this obstacle if I get the job? Or will this impede on my chances of being considered?

I suffer from social anxiety so I trip over my words a little but overall I enjoy meeting new people and feel confident I can get through a one-on-one interview, but a group interview I'm unsure about. Obviously given the line of work, the group one is probably weighted a lot more. Any tips for calming my nerves, should I get an interview?

Lastly, I have no aversion to ""obscure"" or ""lower"" airlines (read:  not American Airlines or Delta, as those require previous Airline experience to begin with). Knowing this, which ones are the best to apply for and most likely to consider me for a position soon?

Thank you very much for any and all help, and I hope you all have a wonderful day!"

I have three tattoos that are concerning.  

One is one my wrist about 1""x1"" and can be completely covered by a watch and not visible - had it in the military and thats the only way I was able to get in with it is that its completely coverable.

&#x200B;

I have two more - one on each forearm - about 2""x2"" which could obviously be covered by any long sleeve attire options.

That said, should I maintain a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and cover them up with makeup and a wristwatch OR should I just be 100% upfront and hope that my military background will help temper the disdain?

I'm a 23 year old male and just graduated last year with Bachelors but not having any luck finding a job in my field. Thinking about a new career and applying to become a flight attendant. Is that weird for male by the way? Also, I know height plays a role and I'm 5'7 but does being buff/heavy side matter too much? I want to see the world and I think this would be the best way. Otherwise I could go back to school for another degree, but wouldn't really like the mundane lifestyle and going on one destination for 2 weeks every year. I've done my research but would like a bit more current insight. I have 7 years of customer service in retail, will that be enough to help to get in? There's a opening at American Airline for bilingual speaker for Cantonese. Just wondering if there is a proficiency test to take? I can speak Cantonese, but I'm not exactly too fluent. At most I can be conversational and still communicate with people but I could practice it more. Is there any writing or reading test for it? What are the pros and cons in your opinions for being a flight attendant?  How hard is the interview process? What are the best airlines to apply for? I live in Atlanta but currently Delta isn't taking application. Not opposed to moving but not sure which airlines pays more and has a better benefits/seniority throughout the year?

I am a aspiring FA, I would love to work for American Airlines or Delta. I want to travel and see the world even if I have to do it alone... 

My main thing is, has any flight attendant been out in a situation they didn’t know how to handle? 

I’m extremely scared I might do the wrong thing, i.e...

One time I was on a Greyhound bus, sitting in the window seat, 2nd row, a little old lady sat next to me. The bus gets a little noisy, the wind hitting windows etc...  Next thing you know this guy is going up and down the aisle, he starts talking about forgetting his meds and he starts talking (I think his references were) war, battle and his buddies. I thought anxiety? PTSD? I didn’t know what to do, he was just standing by my aisle next to the little old lady. I want to ask him if he was okay, but he was calm, just whimpering and mumbling. I stay cool, he touches the ladies hair, I don’t know if accidentally or on purpose and she whimpers, he says sorry. I really wanted to escort him back to his seat but all I could think about was Greyhound doesn’t do security checks, he could have a weapon, what if my intervention triggers something? I wanted to ask the driver or the man in front of me for help, but I was afraid. Maybe I was going to trigger danger to people around me, especially the little old lady next to me. The PTSD  guy gets closer to this driver and door, not sure what he’s aiming for, the guy and woman in front freak out and grabs him. PTSD guy then freaks out, and says I don’t want to hurt you, man says I don’t want to hurt you either but you’re putting my life in danger, PTSD guy says I just want get off the bus. The lady that grabbed him calls the cops, and he’s safely escorted.

I’m upset because I did nothing, I bought the lady a water bottle at the pit stop to try and comfort her but I practically did nothing. 

My dream is to become a flight attendant, but what if something like that happens on a plane and I don’t know what to do? How to handle? I don’t want to become a flight attendant and have my actions harm someone when I’m supposed to keep them safe. HELP!"

87,Do you feel the emotional assist animal program has been abused and what if anything could fix it?,8,7tqd5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/7tqd5v/do_you_feel_the_emotional_assist_animal_program/,9,2018-01-29 09:11:33,"In light of recent incidents and the harder line Delta has chosen to take regarding animals traveling on board. Do the rest of you (flight attendants) feel this program has been almost laughably abused? There is certainly a need here for disabled passengers. Obviously seeing eye dogs get a pass and some others that are harder to spot. Dogs that can detect and warn of an oncoming seizure for example or maybe some that help with PTSD.

Unfortunately, I have seen far too many bringing large and clearly not emotionally supportive animals on the aircraft. Even dogs that are obviously show animals. I feel this puts an unnecessary strain on other passengers comfort in an environment that is already uncomfortable by nature. Those that choose to follow the rules, pay for their pet, get a carrier, keep the pet in the carrier for the duration of the flight, end up looking like chumps next to those that flagrantly abuse this system and save money doing it.

I think a couple things could be done to mitigate this issue.

1.) Make an emotional support animal have to be of a handful of select breeds. No more just getting a certificate for Fluffy. If you need a support animal it must be one of these choice few and possibly come from a select group of licensed breeders.

2.) Not my idea but a fellow FA mentioned requiring insurance for the animal to travel. That way if the animal were to attack the airlines responsibility would be waived and the victims recourse would be through the owner.

My ideas certainly aren't perfect so I'm interested in hearing others views and ideas on this topic. Maybe many of you aren't bothered by the influx of pets onboard and I stand in the minority.

So I finished my live video interview for Delta a couple weeks ago. Unsure how it went but I focused more of showing my genuine self to them instead of rehearsing my answers back to them (that was my down fall last time) and I tried to be shorter with my responses.

I applied as a ready reserve ticketing agent in my state (only thing available in my state that I’m qualified for) and it turns out it’s two hours away from my sisters house (somewhere I can stay rent free for the time being while I get situated if I end up moving up there). I figured if I can’t get in as a FA with Delta, I can at least get into the company and then reapply as a FA in 6 months.

90,Tips and Tricks to Get Through,30,99emol,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/99emol/tips_and_tricks_to_get_through/,8,2018-08-22 20:08:49,"Everyone keeps wanting to know the same questions, so here is my summary as best as I can get. I have posted this before in and out of other comments, and hopefully this will narrow it down and help you. I applied to 4 regionals, got 3 interviews, (one I later declined), and got both offers from the ones I interviewed with. The one regional I didn't get was because I have more than 5 jobs in 5 years, and a non-visible tattoo. So, here is my thoughts to help you:

1. If you are serious about being an FA, it might take you a year or more to get through several applications before being hired. I strongly recommend you take any medical classes like 'First Aid' or 'Basic CPR' to add to your application. (both are generally one day classes and not expensive) Airlines seem to all screen for medical and fine dining backgrounds. I was an Emergency Medical Technician, and for whatever reason, it was on every application I did and helped me get through. Also, any high end waiter jobs are also VERY helpful as is bartending. Avoid having 'too many jobs' hurt me.  **** Before even applying, know the height requirements and tattoo policy. If you are too short or too tall or have a large visible tattoo you will immediately be cut. Don't even apply and go through the process as it's a waste of your time. **** Have a MATCHING passport and state ID. We had one applicant have a married name on her papers, but her maiden name on her passport and she was going to be cut. She could prove she applied for an updated passport and made it through barely. Make sure your stuff matches.

2. Have to do a video interview? Here is what you should know. Most video interviews are of you, answering a question in under a minute from your laptop or cell phone. Some you can do over and over until you get it right. I would actually set up a test ahead of time. Use your laptop camera and video yourself against a solid wall background. Wear a blazer and shirt, and make sure the audio is clean and clear. When doing your videos, avoid 'uh's and 'um's. Speak very slowly and also if you can, write down common phrases ahead of time and sprinkle them into your video interview. Things like 'I am a great candidate for your airline because I am on time, work efficiently, and am perfect at solving customer issues to retain customer loyalty."" Sprinkle educated phrases like this ahead to seem smart and confident. Anytime you can throw in '..helping you make an informed, intelligent decision about hiring me...' goes a long way. 

3. Going to your face to face? YAY! Here is what you should know. 

(A) If you are male, shave. No beards, hipster stuff, earrings, rings, tattoos, or anything that makes you who you are. Your goal is to look like a conservative bank teller. If you are a lady, dress conservative also, no wisps of hair in your face. use lots of spray and hair gel or product and tie your hair back in a bun. Hair should be off of the neck. I think if you have braids/dreads as long as it's tied back you should be ok. No black lipstick. No dangly earrings or anything like that. Google bank teller and that's what you want to look like. Dark blazers, dark pants. Conservative. Look the part. No hipster rings on your hands, or funky watches. One ring. One watch. Maybe a bracelet but I would avoid it. 

(B). Pick your favorite paragraph from your favorite book. Stand in front of a mirror. Try and smile and read it aloud. Read it very very slowly. You will be nervous when you do it, and so your brain will want to read fast, so read slow so it sounds normal when you do it. During the interview, you will be handed a safety paragraph you will be expected to read loudly. Smile, read it aloud slowly. You may be in front of a hundred people, so I hope you are confident in being in front of lots of people. I watched an applicant get up in front of a hundred people, freeze up and cry. Don't be that applicant.

(C) Customer turnaround. Know a well thought out story about a time when you turned around an angry customer into a happy one. Be able to smile as you are saying it, and get it to about a minute long. No 'um's or 'uh's. Speak slow, and with purpose. Pretend you are a stand up comedian in that you should be active, command attention, even talk with your hands if need be. If you stand up like a frozen nervous lump, you will get cut. I actually wrote mine out so I could practice ahead of time and could recite it reasonably well. 

(D) Interview. Mention in the interview how much fun it was to learn CPR and First Aid, and how fascinated you are in learning safety procedures aboard Aircraft. Try and slip it in there when they ask you why you feel you are a great candidate. It might help you get through it. Avoid cliche stuff like 'I'm great with people'. Instead say things like 'I am a master at creating dynamic solutions on the fly to help solve issues angry customers face'. They will look for steps to turn an angry customer, like 'Listen, empthathize, apologize, and propose a solution. (L.E.A.P.)

(E) RESEARCH your airline. I guarantee they will ask you 'What do you know about us?'. Go to the airline's website and know that they operate a fleet of 150 jets and fly to over 180 US Destinations plus Canada and the Caribbean. Know they have about 5,000 employees. Know they have 5 US Bases.

(F) If they ask you if you will relocate, ALWAYS say yes. 99.9% of the time you know the base you are hired for so you know where you have to move to. You can always decline later if you are about to start training and feel you don't want to relocate. 

4. Pay. Before you even apply, make sure you have two full months of money set aside as most training is not paid. Regional training is 4 weeks and up to two weeks for your 3-day initial operating experience. This means it can be two full months before getting a paycheck. Also, $18/flight hour is NOT $18/hr but rather about $9/hr. You don't do this for the money. Regional Airlines like Compass/Endeavor Air/SkyWest/PSA/CommutAir are domestic and fly from Canada to the Bahamas. Mainline such as Delta/American/United fly internationally and can pay as much as $28/flight hour, which is substantially more. Know the money and the facts before.

Anyways, this is my summary so far. I may edit it in the future, but I hope this helps all of you get through and join me in the air. Best of luck!"

Since then, I have realized being a flight attendant is truly what I want for a career. I graduated college last year and just don't like the ""stable 9-5 life"" and I already know I would love the lifestyle of a FA.

As soon as Delta begins hiring again, I'm going to apply. In the meantime I have been trying to prepare as best I can. I applied at United for ""practice"" and completed the video interview and got invited to fly out for in-person, but I didn't go – I love Delta too much. 


My current job is in an office doing marketing online. Before this I've done graphic and web design. The only *true* customer service job I've had was in high school at a pizza shop.

**QUESTIONS:**

- I'm quitting my current job soon and want to work somewhere part-time that would give me good customer service experience for being a flight attendant. I'm thinking working at a nice hotel or restaurant. What do you think would be best?

- Is past working experience in cust. service really important in the hiring process?

So I was back to square one.. waiting on another VI invite email.. few days into vacation (today) I get the invite from HireVue with the link to the interview and everything! I'm stressed because I actually have been really sick the past couple of days (flu-like symptoms) and I now have a very raspy voice and it hurts to talk.. not only that, my family and I have to check out of our vacation home tomorrow to road trip a few hours to a hiking destination and then drive again to find a place to stay over night.. we are going to be road tripping for the next couple of days until my flight home which is about 4-5 days away.. to sum this up I feel like I would be best prepared and relaxed for my interview if I waited until I got back home in about 4-5 days.. my question is, is that too long to wait for me to do the interview? Has anyone done their interview about a week after their email and still got a F2F? If anyone can give me some kind of reassurance on this subject that would be great! Thanks 😅"

119,The Flight Attendant Pay -in 9 to 5 (US airlines),16,2o6sca,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/2o6sca/the_flight_attendant_pay_in_9_to_5_us_airlines/,7,2014-12-03 23:36:11,"All aviation pay is tricky. Lets compare it to the 9 to 5 worker,as best we can. Submitting only 1st year pay, no aviation professional(pilots or fa) may receives over time, and using 80hrs as a base rate/guarantee of hrs for the month. Per diem will not be included as the federal government does not recognize it as income. Just to add, an average per diem may be  $1.75/250hrs a month to equal around 437.50 a month. Profit sharing can not be included in this scenrio as many airlines do not have a program for it or its to specific of a  program for their work groups.
(confused yet? good!)


In a month(30 day month) an average 9 to 5 worker has 8 days off and works 8hrs a day, that is 176 hrs a month. Most airlines give a set guarantee of days off and hours a month to a flight attendant. In this scenrio we will be using the 11 days off and 80hrs of pay a month. ( flight attendants can work up to 14hrs a day and receive anywhere from 4hrs of pay-8hrs of pay depending on sit times, efficiency of flights, etc)

I recently applied to be a Delta flight attendant, and after lurking on this subreddit for a while (this has been super helpful in the app process, thanks for that!) I just filled out an app for Emirates as well. I'm a guy so I don't know how far that'll go. Still, I was really excited about being a flight attendant, but I was hoping that getting a position with Delta would be a great way to travel and get into the company with some work experience, but I was hoping that eventually it would be a good way to start moving up in the company internally. Say to the business side of the airline industry. I have a triple major BA in International Studies, Management in French, so I was hoping to leverage the management side of that after a couple years or so.

I was just wondering if any of you guys heard of or knew people who moved from the flight attendant position to something more corporate with Delta or one of the other big companies. It would be great to know if it's something I can look forward to in that position, or if I should take the job and focus on looking externally for more business-focused roles after a while."

So like the title says, I have a few questions about the above topics that I’d like to get some feedback on. 

1.) I’m bilingual in English and Vietnamese. Last I saw on Delta’s page, Vietnamese wasn’t one of the LOD choices. Does anyone know why that is? I was disappointed, but just assumed it was because it’s not as popular/high demand as the other languages? Idk. I mean, I’d still mention it in my app when I apply, or course, but was curious.

2.) I wear glasses and am practically blind without ‘em. Never worn contacts before. Should I stick with my glasses for the interviews (video and F2F) or should I ditch ‘em and try contacts? I’ve always been curious about this one and have never heard or read anyone’s thoughts on it, so I gotta ask... does it matter? I’d like to think not so much and that most airlines wouldn’t be too strict on this, but I wonder if anyone can chime in and tell me what they’ve experienced–whether you were the one wearing glasses or saw others at the F2F wearing glasses. I’ve seen a bunch of FAs (on YT) wear glasses when working, but what about before you become a FA?

3.) So rn I have a bob hairstyle. It’s fine if I keep it down and not tie it up for the interviews/F2F, right? Same dilema with the glasses bc I don’t think it’s a big deal and as long as I look neat, well put together, and presentable, I think I’ll be fine, but wanted to hear your guys’ anecdotes about this one, too. I’ve also seen FA YouTubers sport all types of hairstyles, but is there a preferred style for each hair length (especially at the interview process)?

Thanks in advance for your time and help, guys! These kinda seem like silly questions (even to me), but I’d like to get your feedback on ‘em anyways–especially if you’ve been through it irl! "

A bit of background. We both used to live in SF and I got a really good job opportunity to Atlanta and moved here late last year. She had always wanted to be a flight attendant so I encouraged her to start applying here in Atlanta (since it's a giant hub) and she got a job with Skywest in March. 

They based her out of Chicago after training and has been putting in domicile transfer requests every month and got it granted this month. Obviously we're both delighted to be living together again soon but I've been researching on what her quality of work will be like. 

While in Chicago, she had a whole lot more work (for United and Delta) and multi-day trips and was kept fairly busy. I looked at the Atlanta destinations (strictly Delta flights) and they seem much more limited and I'm worried that although she's going to be with me, that she won't enjoy her work as much or get paid as much as she did while based in ORD. I've also noticed the number of flight attendants here is much lower than ORD.

So my questions for anyone with experience flying for Skywest in Atlanta are:

- What is it like working out of Atlanta?
- Is it just lots of single day trips or are there multi-day trips?
- Is there free parking at the airport for flight attendants?

Thanks for bearing with me.

Can someone post the Delta shoe guidelines for the current uniform? I know they are supposed to be plain black leather, no suede or parent leather, but I'm looking for specifics.

Like can they have a strap, are Mary Janes ok? What about a t strap? If a strap is ok, is there a limit to the size or color of the button or buckle that holds the strap on? What about elastic straps? I know contrast stitching is not allowed, but what about black stitching?

I know that concourse shoes have to have a heel between half an inch and 3 inches, but does this vary depending on which uniform you are wearing? I don't like pants, so I would want a pair I can wear with the skirt and the dresses."

Also I kind of want to feel out my chances. I'm planning on applying to Delta, Southwest, United, and American.

* When I apply should I apply before I turn 21, like a week or two prior, or as soon as I turn? I want to get in my application as soon as possible, but I don't want to have it tossed just because it's a few weeks before I'm 21.

* I started in on a French course earlier this year at a community college and I'm hoping this ups my chances a little, but how far along should I be before putting myself down as bilingual?

* Should I invest in a skirt suit if I get an interview and if so how simple/dressy should it be?

* I have a flight attendant for Southwest who is willing to recommend me, but I don't have any job experience to but down outside of a restaurant I worked at for about a year. This is due to a mixture of bad job market, a cushy few years of high school babysitting from people who paid me more than they needed to, a lot of focus on college courses, and some stupid decisions. I'm still trying to get work at some new retail stores opening up around my area, but how badly will this affect me?

* I weigh 130 lbs, but I wouldn't consider myself particularly in shape. Should I start exercising more in preparation? (Also cardio, core, or arms and legs?)

* Any advice on what to expect in questions if I get the interview or other helpful tips for things I couldn't think of are also very much appreciated."

2) I don't wear make up at all, so I didn't for either video. Mistake?

I also don't have exactly customer service experience but I tried to spin my job, I work in home healthcare, as such. Is this also hurting me?

I'm going to apply to Delta-- I think it opens in June?-- and would love some insight if I made some critical mistakes. Also, no amount of googling answers my question: when United/AA open again (when?) can I immediately apply again? 

And how do I find out which companies are hiring when? I'm trying to not let the rejection consume me because working at an airline is just what I want to do, I want connections to be able travel while still young so I'm not gonna give up yet! Thanks for any advice on the matter. Sorry if this is long or frequently asked kinda stuff."

To be completely honest I've based my past  jobs around this dream to gain experience. I've worked in nothing but customer service since I was 15. Food/retail and a five star hotel. I worked a stint as a TSA officer so I know most of the safety rules for airlines on the ground and a basic understanding of air safety as well as the unseen dangers FAs face.

I was embarrassed to say it at one point but I've had three F2F with AA. 2 with Delta. 2 with United. Then a few regional group interviews. But the more I see how competitive it is I have just been working on myself. I'm independent but I do have moments where I am more reserved. I also have a very hard time bragging on myself. I'm confident but its awkward to sell myself just because of the way I was raised. (Always taught to be extremely humble). I feel like I always undersell myself. I've been getting farther and farther the last few though. 


Anything traits that should be really focused on when speaking of myself? Generically I guess. I studied french, Japanese, and mandarin in college. I've used each in life situations but do not consider myself in anyway fluent. Is it worth mentioning these? "

I am asking because I am currently working full-time and I'm nervous about applying and then if I get the f2f interview how I would request off to be flown out to get interviewed and what kind of excuse I would give my job. I only have 1 vacation day left for the year. And a doctor's appointment excuse wouldn't work because that's usually just a half-day.

I've been thinking more and more over the past couple years about becoming a flight attendant, and pulled the trigger on some applications over the past few months. I've spent some time reading over threads in this subreddit, and various AMAs, but I had a few specific questions here. 

1) I've got a F2F with PSA on Wednesday - can anyone lend any insight as to what they're like? I know it's a regional airline so shorter routes (and less pay) operating as American Express, but that's about it.

2) I applied for AA back in December, did the assessment a few days later, and then did the VI a couple of weeks ago. I'm waiting to hear back on F2F for them as well; any advice? Or am I just in the ""hurry up and wait"" stage?

3) I applied for Delta back in August, did the video interview about a week later, then the assessment about 2.5 months later...and haven't heard anything since. Although on Delta's website, it says my application is still ""under review"" (though its archived now). 

4) I know that, starting off, the pay is rough; how does everyone adapt at first? Also, in the event I need relocate (which I almost certainly will have to, as my current hometown isn't a hub), I've been told there are resources that help FA's help find affordable housing.

First I should say that I applied for two Flight Attendant positions already one being with Delta where I got the thanks but not thanks. First time, so I'm not too discouraged.

Anyways, I'm a twenty-five year old male and I'm interested in pursuing a career as a Flight Attendant because I prefer to work with people where your labor feels more natural in contrast to dehumanizing office work which is what I do now. I also don't like being in one place all the time. I love to travel, especially alone, and am interested in aviation. 

I have tons of customer and emergency service experience. I've worked in restaurants, I've volunteered as a Firefighter/EMT and I currently oversee Logistics for a company which does involve notable customer service.

Don't know why I felt it was necessary to share all of that as my initial question was regarding a pay cut as I've heard and see Flight Attendants make next to nothing, especially early in the career.

I've done my research but I guess I'm looking for inspiration and personnel guidance from those who have gone down this path. Would you say becoming a Flight Attendant was the best decision you ever made? In your opinion, do the benefits in theory, justify the low pay? Have you ever left a job where you were making exceptionally more and feel you've made the right decision?

I feel the calling to make a drastic career change. Hope to hear some stories.

Thanks.

I used to be a flight attendant for a regional airline for a few months back in 2012. I was fresh out of college and had dreams of being a flight attendant. The airline had a newer crew base where I lived, so I figured it was a perfect fit. The base was only open for a few months and then the base was terminated. I was informed that all of us would have to relocate to the IAD base. I had some personal family health issues and I was not in a spot in my life where I felt comfortable enough to relocate. The company literally only gave us a week to relocate before the base shut down. I ultimately decided to quit. I did not give the appropriate two weeks before leaving and therefore am not eligible for rehire.

I received my FAA flight attendant certificate in September 2012. I have applied for both mainline Delta and United’s flight attendant openings recently.  I do not list the regional on my resume because I feel that would only hinder my chances when they see I was a flight attendant for only a few months. 

I interviewed with mainline American about a year after I left the regional and actually got to the f2f and actually got pulled aside with a few other people to speak with additional airline representatives after they escorted a large group out. The reps asked more detailed questions about my experience at the regional and also my reasoning for leaving. I was very honest with them. After, I was very confident and thought that I had it, but ultimately got a tbnt email about a week later. 

I feel that being open about my experience and my ineligibility to be rehired definitely hurt my chances with American.

Regardless of listing the regional on my application, I am still searchable on the FAA website.  My question is, If anything did happen with Delta or United and I passed training, would already being in the FAA Database and not mentioning my previous experience be enough for them to rescind a job offer?

Any input is appreciated! Thanks!"

I just wanted to share and maybe find some encouragement and maybe hear about everyone’s experiences at this phase?

Thank you for being a resource for me thus far! 💗"

Right now I'm considering applying for Korean LOD FA, but I'm nervous about the language testing.

I'm about intermediate in Korean speaking and listening, decent (if a bit slow) in reading, and pretty bad with writing.


Does anyone know if airlines test your writing? 

Also, what level of language fluency do they usually test for? 


I can talk in Korean all day long about day-to-day things like food or shopping, but I'm a complete blank when it comes to talking about all the high-brow stuff like politics or the economy."

Roughly 6 hours later, my wife realized she left her computer in the seatback pocket. It's a 10-year-old Macbook but the sentimental value is very high in terms of files that exist only on the computer. She's filled out Delta's [lost item form](https://live.nettracer.aero/delta-paxview/lostandfound/landing.do). Think there's any hope we'll see the computer again? Anyone have any insight into how the lost item procedure works for Delta? Anything we can or should do beyond filling out that form to enhance our chances of getting it back?

UPDATE: Update: One of the Delta agents from our morning flight found the laptop between SLC and LA, and then brought it back to SLC this afternoon. We're in town for a wedding, and the Delta agent who found it and called me even walked the computer to the Frontier gate where my sister flew in, who picked it up. Long story short, we are VERY thankful for and impressed by the Delta flight crew."

Update for Delta employees: I've been a non-rev companion for the past 4 years. The employee that i've been a companion rider of was working with EasyJet. EasyJet and several other airliners had a partnership with Delta, United & American. These contracts were no renewed and now most of you flyer should see just ""DL"" airliners in the standby section. This will probably make it easier for non-revs to fly. Just thought i'd share the news."

I hope this isn’t annoying. I just applied as a flight attendant to several different airlines including Delta, United, American and Mesa. I was contacted by United about doing a video interview this morning. I have absolutely no flight attendant contacts and was just hoping to get any sort of advice!! Is the video interview something that all applicants go through? or did they like me based off my application? I don’t have a college degree although I was in college for 2.5 years (I am taking time off to save money and finish my degree). I also have no safety experience but tons of customer service experience. I’m also only 21. Will airlines see it as a bad thing that I’m so young?? 

Literally anything you could tell me is helpful. I’m sorry this was long and rambly "
