7,Who gets booted first due to airline overbooking (in light of United Airlines incident),44,64lun9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/64lun9/who_gets_booted_first_due_to_airline_overbooking/,67,2017-04-10 23:41:12,"Hey everyone, I'm not a regular to /r/travel, but I think I have a little research others might find valuable. In light of the [doctor being violently dragged off of a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/64jmub/doctor_violently_dragged_from_overbooked_united/) and the resulting social media backlash, I decided to do some digging into what airlines do when it comes to overbooking. All of the below information came from each individual airline's Contract of Carriage, which can be found on their websites (I've provided links to the ones I researched). Naturally I'm not going to have everyone's preferred airline, so don't hate on me too bad if I didn't include your go-to. 

Per regulations, every airline asks for volunteers to give up their spot for compensation. After that, airlines can set their own rules to decide who gets left behind. Now then, in no particular order...

**United Airlines** looks at several variables: Fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and time of check-in without advanced seat assignment. Basically if you're not a loyal customer and/or early bird, you might not want to get too comfortable in your seat. [Read United's full policy here - Rule 25](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec25)

**Southwest Airlines** is pretty simple. The person in the last boarding position will be denied boarding, regardless of fare. [Read Southwest's full policy here - Page 39](https://www.southwest.com/assets/pdfs/corporate-commitments/contract-of-carriage.pdf)

**American Airlines** bases the decision primarily on check-in time, but also takes severe hardships, fare paid, and frequent flyer status into consideration sometimes as well. [Read American's full policy here](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#oversales)

**Delta Airlines** has a pretty complex policy. Essentially, if you paid a premium fare, you have nothing to worry about. That said, passengers with boarding passes are safer than those who don't have them or didn't check in. In those cases, rebooked passengers or frequent flyers are safer than a passenger who didn't check in and doesn't have a boarding pass. Exception: Special needs passengers (disabilities, unaccompanied minors, etc.) are likely good to go no matter what. [Read Delta's full policy here - Rule 245 on Page 42](http://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract_of_carriage_dom.pdf)

**Frontier Airlines** has a policy about as simple as Southwest. Passengers who check in after all seats have been assigned won't get a seat. [Read Frontier's full policy here](https://www.flyfrontier.com/legal/contract-of-carriage/)

**Alaska Airlines** favors the early bird. Anyone with a confirmed seat assignment won't get booted. Don't have one? Show up early and you're more likely to get a seat. [Read Alaska's full policy here](https://www.alaskaair.com/~/media/Files/PDF/contract-of-carriage/Alaska-Airlines-Contract-of-Carriage.pdf?INT=AS_Legal_||20160816_CoC_ENG||)

**So you've been involuntarily bumped. Now what?** If they can still get you to your destination within an hour on a different flight, airlines aren't required to pay you anything. If you get there between 60-119 minutes after your scheduled arrival, you're owed 200% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $675). If you arrive 120 minutes or longer, you're owed 400% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $1350). There's other small print to go through, but that's the gist.

Hopefully this is a little bit helpful. It was somewhat eye-opening to realize that this wasn't just a United Airlines thing."
8,Possibly flying Wow Airlines. Are they as bad as their online reviews suggest?,23,7qjyuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7qjyuz/possibly_flying_wow_airlines_are_they_as_bad_as/,64,2018-01-15 17:24:49,"I'm planning a trip from Detroit to Reykjavik and the cheapest possible option to do that is on Wow Airlines. I understand that it's a budget airline, so I will have to pay for literally anything beyond the seat I'm sitting in. After reading the online reviews I am skeptical to fly with them. 

I am not checking any luggage so I am not concerned with lost items. My biggest concern is flight delays, as that seems to be a pretty frequent complaint. 

The trip is the first week of September so there shouldn't be any weather delays but I am unsure if it's worth saving $500-$800 flying with Wow instead of Delta/United if travel delays are that commonplace. 

Does anyone have any experience flying on Wow Airlines? Any advice on whether we should save the money and book Wow versus spending extra to fly a more reputable airline? "

We always preboard with our 7-year-old son Henry, who is on the autism spectrum, because the boarding process can be very overwhelming for him (crowds, noise, etc). After boarding in Minneapolis, a flight attendant named Natalie came over to introduce herself and see if Henry needed anything. The kiddo immediately took a shine to her and started asking all sorts of questions about the plane. Natalie went out of her way to bring over demo oxygen masks and life jackets for Henry to look at. She surprised him with a chocolate bar and extra cookies. She listened as he talked about being on the spectrum and about how loud noises bothered him. After finding out that his birthday was the previous week, she got together with the other flight attendants and made a crown of cookie packages for him to wear and came over to wish him a happy birthday. She arranged for the pilot to come over the intercom and give a special welcome to Henry and thank him for his help during the flight. She was a friend to a little boy who doesn't always feel like he has too many of those. When the flight landed at LaGuardia, the pilot presented him with special golden wings (just like the pilots wear), let him try on his hat, and then the crew got together for pictures.

Natalie and the rest of team on Delta Flight 1596 went above and beyond the call of duty to help him feel special. Henry later said that he ""felt like a FIRST CLASS passenger"" and said that he would ""never forget my best friend Natalie."" You can't get much better than that."
10,How One United Airlines Maintenance Guy in San Francisco Ruined Everybody's Trip to Sydney,28,2rsw0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2rsw0p/how_one_united_airlines_maintenance_guy_in_san/,59,2015-01-09 03:16:15,"Greetings, /r/travel - 

I'm still processing what ended up being one of the worst nights of my life on what should have been the trip of a lifetime.  A single United Airlines maintenance guy managed to ruin **everybody's** night, cost me $1100 and I never even saw what the guy looked like.  Hopefully, one or two things will happen as a result of this post - Someone might help me understand how to make this right with United ... I seem to be at a loss since our flight was 'cancelled' not 'bumped.'  Second thing, hopefully this helps you understand what happens when you fly United and what you can expect if the unexpected happens.  Here goes ...

***Here's What Happened***

We boarded our flight at SFO (UA863, if you want to know) and prepared for a 15-hr nonstop flight to Sydney.  It left at 10:30PM and when we boarded and went to the back row, we discovered that our seats were still in pieces at the back of the plane due to some 'maintenance issue.'  We got them back together, settled in and waited for takeoff.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.

They kept updating us every 15 minutes that a 'maintenance issue' was delaying us but they expected to leave shortly.  I took a nap and kept my 8-year-old occupied.  They took pity on us, passed out water and let us use the lavs.  I kept telling myself that the matter would soon be resolved and we'd be on our way.

I was wrong.

After three hours - it was 1:30 at this point.   They cancelled our flight.  The 270 people on the flight, all sleepy and pissed off, filed off the plane and we started making other arrangements.  Given that the flight was on 12/19, I knew it was going to be tough to find alternate arrangements since everyone seems to go down to Sydney at that time of year.  Called the 800 number, made arrangements to get booked on another flight, only to learn that the next available flight leaves Los Angeles two days later.  That created boondoggle #1, in which we discover that Expedia's non-refundable rooms really mean non-refundable.  Now we're out over $500 for the two days we won't be there.

So we stand in line anyway for another 2 hours to see if we can get a better option - it's 3:30 by the time I finally talk to a gate agent and find out, no, no other planes are leaving ... including the one that we just left.

And we didn't leave for a really stupid reason: 

Turns out - the only thing keeping us leaving that night was the latch on the crew sleeping quarters door of the 777.  I guess it wouldn't lock right and the maintenance guy spent 3 hours farting around with it instead of replacing the door, as he announced he finally would, just in time for the captain to say ""we're not allowed to fly after that amount of time so sorry, this flight is cancelled.""

I don't know about you but I've work in maintenance operations for a living and I know that you're allowed to escalate issues to replace non-working hardware when you can't find the simple answer in a short amount of time.  Had the maintenance guy been competent, he would have spent 30 minutes troubleshooting the door, replaced it in another 60 and this thread would never have happened.

***And Then ...***

We go downstairs to get our bags back.  Turns out, someone at United decides that everyone getting a bag back needs to file a 'lost bag claim,' creating another 2 or 3 hour-long line for us to stand in.  After about half an hour, we decide ""we'll check our bags when we return for our rescheduled flight"" and go home.  I'm glad we did - some people stayed there until 10 the following morning waiting for the one guy working baggage at 3am to get their bags.  Some of them never did.

It's now 4am.  Never having used Uber before, I approach a cab driver for a lift home.  He tels me that it'll cost me $150 to get home and United has already told me that I'll be compensated for my cab trip.  Fine, whatever, let's just go home.  We pile in and he drives us 45 minutes to get back home.  It's pissing down rain and it takes him (no joke) 30 minutes to figure out how to do a manual credit card receipt transaction since his reader isn't working and he won't take a check.  I have this guy yelling in Persian at someone on the phone in my drive way at 5am on a Saturday for half an hour - surprised my neighbors didn't call the cops.

***And Then ...***

We show up early to SFO 2 days later - I carefully check with United and Delta to make sure our bags were found and ready to go down to Sydney since my wife has time-sensitive medication and she only packed so much in her carry-on.  After several trips back and forth, they assure us that yes, the bags are checked ... we should be good to go.  We jump on the Delta flight, change at LAX and then down to Sydney.

When we arrive - sure enough - there's problems.  The bag with the medicine arrived (thank God) but one of our bags, the one with all of our fancy-dress event clothing is not there.  We file a 'lost bag' claim in Sydney, go out and wait for our clothes.

Next day?  No bag

Getting desperate, we go to the CBD and buy some last-minute clothing for our event.  Between the clothes, shoes and toiletries we were missing, another $400 down the drain.  Our bag eventually shows, but too late to do anything other than say ""yeah, that's nice.""  We put the whole thing out of our mind, even though I do file a claim with United for all of the money we lost as a result of the unlatched crew sleeping quarters door.

And Now
I just got an email today from United.  They offered a '$125 voucher' as a gesture of goodwill.  I declined and requested compensation similar to what they'd offer someone who has been involuntarily bumped from a flight.  They declined, saying ""  Please understand that our industry is vulnerable to a number of challenges that can, and do, affect our operation on a daily basis. For us to absorb our passengers’ incurred expenses or offer cash for compensation would not be a long-term business proposition we would ever be able to maintain.""

This is from the company that paid their CEO $8 Million last year and the last CEO $17 Million when he exited as part of the United / Continental merger.  I don't think asking for $1100 to compensate us is unreasonable, they pay as much as $1300 per bumped passenger.

**What We Lost**
I did the math:

* $130 for the cab ride home at 4am
* $526.78 in lost hotel room fees
* $45 for the Uber Ride Back (Never using SF Cabs again)
* $435.73 to replace the clothes we had to buy because our bag was lost in Los Angeles

All told - we spent $1137.51 because a United Maintenance Guy couldn't figure out how to get a crew sleeping quarters door latch to close in less than 3 hours.  United's offer of a $125 voucher' as a 'goodwill' gesture doesn't even cover the cab ride home, to say nothing of everything else we lost.

I'm happy to say that Reddit helped us enjoy our stay otherwise - the folks over at /r/sydney were top-notch as far as their recommendations go and we managed to have a great time down under ...

That is, as long as we didn't talk about United.

Suggestions?

***TL;DR - Flew on United, they cancelled our flight for a dumb reason and now we're out $1137.51***

EDIT - To clarify, I realize that many people feel that this is 'just one of those things' that United should not be held accountable for.  Let me add some information that I feel should be helpful:

* United had this 777 at the gate for several hours before boarding, I know because we were there to look at it.  Any maintenance issues with the plane had many, many hours to be handled before takeoff.  Whatever happened in terms of maintenance at 10:30 in the evening didn't have to wait for that point in time to be handled (i.e. - if my seat could be torn apart and put back together at 10:30, there's no reason it couldn't have been put back together at 3:30).  United didn't put a priority on having this plane passenger-ready for an on-time departure.

* The issue that caused our flight to be cancelled was something that could have been handled in a shorter amount of time had United focused on getting us in the air on time as planned.  Instead, the maintenance guy troubleshot the door for 3 hours before announcing that the door needed to be replaced, an activity taking, according to them '60 minutes', putting them over the amount of time they were allowed to fly.  Had United put a priority on getting passengers into the air, the maintenance crew should have been free to say ""You know, this is taking too long - let's replace the door and get these people out of here.""  I don't know the circumstances behind their decision to troubleshoot instead of replace, but when you're doing maintenance for a living and people's dollars are being lost for every minute you're troubleshooting, you're allowed to say ""do what you have to do, get these people back online.""

Are all of these things minor issues?  Yeah, sure ... but when minor issues are allowed to get in the way of the trip you've been planning for seven years, when those issues create a cascade effect of other problems that you were not budgeting for then yes, you're understandably disappointed.  You also expect the company whose decisions created the circumstance to make it right.  

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR** - booked trip thru Expedia w/ connection that's too short to realistically make. Wut do?
--

Booked a trip that goes from a major US airport to CDG before heading to BCN. I assumed (incorrectly) that I would be able to make my connecting flight with only **1 hour 15 minutes**, because in all my flying experience I've never needed more than a half hour between flights.

The internet says **I'm screwed**. We are going from terminal *2E* to *2F*, so they are close - **but**, we are going to have to go through passport control and/or customs, and with 1 hour 15 minutes, we're in a bad spot. The general consensus where this question has been asked before (it's a popular one) is - for CDG you need at *least* 2 hours.

What I've found so far is the following:

1. Some say there will be people standing by the gate when we arrive who are there specifically for ""tight"" connections? They can get us through passport control in some sort of express lane?
2. Some say just don't worry about it, they'll book you on the next available flight? It's Delta through and through (although obviously the short hop is a ""sub"" airline of Delta).
3. Could possibly try to change the booking? Since it's been booked through Expedia, what's the best route to change it? Try and go through Expedia, or through the airline itself?"

In November, I'll be motorbiking solo up Vietnam from Ho Chi Ming City to Hanoi. I've done a good bit of research myself but some things I've had trouble finding definitive or up to date info on. I'm hoping some of you will have some good advice! I'll try and keep it short and will be happy to detail/ explain my thoughts in any questions/ comments you may have!
  
  
Background:

I'm 25M from London and have some time off between quitting my last job and starting my next. I've wanted to do this trip since that Top Gear episode, so this is a great opportunity. The closest trip I've done to this was 2 weeks in Thailand a few years ago (Bankkok, Chang Mai, Phuket, Koh Tao - buses not bikes though).

In terms of budget like most backpackers I'll be staying at hostels most of the trip and generally not splurging but if there are awesome food/ places/ activities that cost a bit more I'm going to pay for them. I've also read it's really not worth the $1-2 difference arguing with a local who will occasionally try and scam you, so I'm ok with that too.

  
[Itinerary](http://imgur.com/1vNgscO) - obviously this is flexible and comments welcome about how I've crammed too much in or X place is a tourist trap and not worth doing:

(Day 1 is Monday 31st Oct)

Day 1 - 5: Ho Chi Minh City (+Mekong Delta if worthwhile?)

Day 6 - 7: Vung Tau & Mui Ne

Day 8 - 10: Dalat & Nha Tran

Day 10 overnight train from Nha Tran to Da Nang for Hoi An

Day 11 - 15: Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue

Day 16 - 17: Dong Ha, Dong Hoi 

Day 17 overnight train from Dong Hoi to Hanoi

Day 18 - 20: Sa Pa, Ha Giang (possibly overnight trains)

Day 21 - 22: Cat Ba/ Halong Bay

Day 23 - 27: Hanoi

  
Questions:

**1) Motorbike**: Instead of what bike to get or who I should get it from I'll ask it slightly differently: [A Honda Blade from Tigit Motorbike in HCMC](http://tigitmotorbikes.com/travel/honda-blade/) works out to be 234 USD for the whole trip ($1000 purchase price - $800 guaranteed buyback + $34 transport cost from Hanoi to HCMC). This price seems competitive vs craigslist, Facebook and the reviews on [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d6429729-Reviews-Tigit_Motorbikes_Guided_Day_Tours-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tigitmotorbikes/reviews) are almost all 5 stars. Why shouldn't I go for this?

**2) Overnight Train vs Motorbiking**: Reasoning behind the overnight trains is mainly there doesn't seem to be as much to see/do between Nha Trang - Hoi An and Dong Hoi - Hanoi. These are long rides (500km / 2 days' ride per segment, mostly on Highway 1) and with train I can just sleep and save time/money. What would I be missing out on?

**3) Ho Chi Minh Highway**: This is apparently *the* road to take to go up or down Vietnam, however my itinerary as it stands doesn't take advantage of this very well (other than maybe between Hue and Dong Hoi). This will be my first time in Vietnam so I feel like I should check off the main sights. Will I be missing out on too much? Also how bad is Highway 1 from your experience?

**4) Weather**: How would bad weather affect my trip, are there any deal breakers (e.g. Hoi An flooding)?

**5) Accommodation**: Is it necessary to book ahead, if so how far in advance? I'm inclined to wing it to be more flexible and from reading about *nha nghi* it seems that I should just be able to walk in?

**6) Gear/Bag**: I going to try and fit everything in a 35-40L pack and get mostly quick drying clothes. I am hoping to pack pretty lightly as I don't have any DSLRs or special gear to take. I'll probably do another post once I've acquired most of the gear I'll be taking and am ready to pack, but is there anything less obvious that I should be aware of?

**7) Currency**: I'm planning on using ATMs for most of the cash needs, I'm with HSBC, which should give me free withdrawals at theirs and Techcombank's ATMs, I'll pay FX fee but that's <3% which isn't bad. How much cash should I carry on me normally? I would think £50 equivalent should be plenty? 

**8) Visa**: on arrival (most websites quote 25 + 20 USD) vs from embassy (Haven't been able to find cost) - I have a UK passport, happy to leave it with the embassy for a few days.

  
Thanks so much for taking the time to read and for everyone who comments! I'm going to bed now but will respond to all comments/ messages when I get up and clarify anything that may be unclear!

I've read through a bunch of threads already, and have a rough idea in my mind of what I would like to do. I just spent an amazing month in Thailand and was happy to have so much time in one country as I won't get that luxury in these next ones. For that reason, I decided to cut out Laos all together to enjoy these countries more thoroughly (have to save something for next time!).  

I was thinking 1 week in Cambodia and 2 weeks in Vietnam. Is that a good split? There just seems to be so much to do in Vietnam and the country is so large there will be a lot of time spent travelling. Will be flying into Siem Reap on Aug 25th and planning to do 3 days in Angkor. I have 3 more nights in Cambodia, should I head to Phnom Penh or Sihanoukville? Or somewhere else? After that we will start our journey through Vietnam from south to north. I was thinking about doing something like Mekong Delta > HCMC > Hoi An > Hanoi > Sapa. Is that a good plan? How much time should I spend in each area?

Most of all, I would like your recommendations of where to stay and what I should do / can't miss in each location.

Also, I am 23/M, will be travelling with 2 friends in Cambodia and 1 in Vietnam. I'm very social and enjoy a good mix of outdoor/physical activity, culture, beaches/partying. 

EDIT: Any information on getting a visa for Vietnam would be greatly appreciated! As far as I know, for Cambodia we can get them on arrival for around $20USD, right?

Thanks again r/travel, you guys have been so helpful and made my time in Thailand absolutely incredible! Can't wait to pay it forward. :)"

So I just bought a plane ticket from California to London Dec. 30-Jan 26. Tickets usually run between $1000-$1400. I was expecting to pay around $1000. I go on Kayak last night (around 11:30pm for me) and search and I that to fly with Delta it's only $730!! Both leaving and returning flights have a 1 hour layover, but it was so much cheaper I didn't care! What did I do right? Was it searching late at night, or the time frame from departure date? I'd really like to know! When I went back on kayak.com today and got the exact same flight with delta it is $1110. "

I know how the price of international airline tickets go up slowly for a few months, then about at the 90 day mark before the flight, they start to rapidly increase (or at least that's what I've read.) My two cheapest options are Turkish Airlines or Delta. Maybe someone can recommend one over the other. I need to make a decision pretty quickly as the day I get paid will be day 89 from the day of departure. The main question I have, is what happens if they decide to cancel my flight or something else happens? All of the ticket options say non-refundable and the price of the round trip (May 31st to Aug 23rd give or take a day or two) is the equivalent to an entire months worth of pay for me. I would be pretty devastated if I were just out that much money. Can someone give this first time international traveler a bit of advice? Thanks."

The day started in Atlantic City, the last overnight stay of an epic road trip covering over 2000 miles of the US east coast. We were up nice and early, as we had a train to catch from Philadelphia to NYC (our flight home was from NYC) which was due to depart at 10:35 AM. The plan was to drive to Philly, drop our car off at the rental place and then catch a taxi to the train station. All went well until the taxi. Upon arriving at the Amtrak station, I notice my phone is missing. I remember using it inside the taxi, so I try calling it, but it has been turned off. It had a full charge when I lost it, so I'm assuming someone (most likely the taxi driver) has turned it off so it can't be tracked. This is especially devastating as my phone had all my photos from the trip on it.

In the mad rush to find my phone, we miss the train to NYC. We pay again and rebook, but then we go to the wrong platform and miss the second train. We pay and rebook again.

Then on the flight from NYC to LA (that same day) we can't land in LA as crosswinds are too strong. We circle for an hour before diverting to Phoenix. We wait in Phoenix for an hour before heading to LA, where we have two aborted landings (one we actually touched the ground before taking off again) before landing safely. This delay means we miss our connecting flight to Australia, which was with a different airline so we have to rebook and pay for those tickets again. The flight isn't for another 24 hours, and the airline (Delta) refuses to pay for our accommodation. 

On the plus side, we did get to spend a day in LA."

and the gates were located on the complete opposite sides of the terminal. i had to run down the entire length of the terminal. from gate 72 to gate 7, all in 15-20 minutes. i tried to make it but apparently i was late by 2 minutes. they closed the doors a few minutes earlier and that fucked me. coupled with getting delayed a few minutes while getting off my first plane

the whole thing was bull shit to be honest. had no control over it and just got fucked due to circumstance. thankfully i was able to get on the next flight which was 4 hours later. it was either that or a flight 8 hours later which would have totally fucked up my trip

how do i avoid this mess from happening again? i think i shouldn't book flights with short lay overs anymore and give myself at least 2-3 hours. it fucking sucks but i can't handle my trips getting randomly fucked over like this

i paid $60 for preferred seats on the flight i missed too. now i'm gonna get stuck with a stupid middle seat in between 2 people for 4 hours. and then i have to spend time calling delta at the end of this to get my money back

My favorite airline is by far Lufthansa. When it comes to leg room (Im tall, so this is important to me), food quality and nice service, they take the cake in my book. 

I never liked AA or Delta. Food is okay at best and the employees don't seem very friendly.

One that surprised me was Aeroflot. I had really low expectations and they ended up being superb. On par or even exceeding American competitors.

I'm planning a relatively inexpensive trip to Frankfurt, Germany for about 8 days sometime next year. WOW Air is *significantly* cheaper than every other airline - I've found a roundtrip flight for $300 from MIA-KEF-FRA and then FRA-KEF-MIA. 

But the reviews of WOW Air are... awful. 

A lot of them seem to be about the on-flight food/beverage costs, luggage costs, and lack of entertainment. That won't be a problem for me: I'll travel with a single carry-on, following their weight and dimension guidelines (or purchasing extra weight beforehand if necessary). I'll also bring my own food, entertainment, etc. for the flight itself. I read the fine print and I'll be prepared.

Part of me wants to play it safe and go with an airline I know, like Lufthansa, Air Berlin, or even Delta. But a $300 *roundtrip* flight from Miami to Germany? I can't find that anywhere. I'm willing to have a generally worse experience to save $500+, but the reviews - without context - are really scaring me here.

So is WOW Air really that bad? Will I have to worry about missing connecting flights due to extremely excessive delays, or having flights completely cancelled with no reimbursement? Do you have good or bad experiences you could share?"

I checked Delta, Alitalia, and other direct sites and it was like $5,000+ for two multi-city tickets.  Sites like Travelocity and Kayak have tickets closer to $2,500.

I'm envisioning a subreddit where these two broad types of people meet. Tripgoers give a general outline (origin and destination, budget, length of trip, dates or season, interests, etc.). Tripplanners respond and create dream itineraries with lodging, suggested sights, and transportation based on the tripgoer's parameters. The tripgoer selects the itinerary that interests them the most. 

I'm imagining a system like r/changemyview: In that subreddit, people award ""deltas"" to folks who successfully change their view. In this one, the winning tripplanner gets a ""delta"" of some kind. 

In exchange for a nicely-planned getaway, the tripgoer would post a trip review with pictures and feedback of the itinerary. That way, when the tripplanners get our chance to travel, we'll have a little bit more intel.

About 24 hours ago in Thailand, my nephew who is 4 years old was hit by a motorcycle on a family vacation.. He has been trying to work with Delta to get home with his family and children. Rather than accommodate him and his family, they are trying to price gouge my brother for a medical emergency where my nephew needs two seats in first class to keep his leg elevated to travel back to the US to see a pediatric orthopedic surgeon.

Delta has done horrible things in the past - but this is fucking unreal to me. If you can, please retweet this and share in an effort to make Delta show some compassion for this issue. Policy change is needed from within for medical emergencies. Trying to make a buck on a customer who medically needs a seat is unacceptable. My brother and I are dumbfounded over this situation and just want to get him and his family home so he can save his sons leg and his life.. 

Absolutely unreal. 6.2k apparently is Delta's assessed value of saving a child's leg and possibly their life.

Cheers,

> Thank you for all of your wonderful responses! I actually ended up going a completely different direction since a friend invited me to a weekend stop over in New York on my way out. I ended up going with a mix of Jet Blue, Delta (I splurged for the premium seat on the long haul) and Air France. I may regret my decision once I'm at the airport, but for now my desire to change things up has won out. It's not my last trip, so I can always learn my lesson and go back to my predictable LH flight next time. 



I am taking a trip from Houston to Naples, Italy in December... again.  
This will be my 7th time in 18 months. Typically I've flown with Lufthansa with a few other airlines mixed in occasionally (United/Canada/Brussels) Unfortunately military pay (hubby is stationed over there) doesn't allow for frequent international travel in anything nicer than economy. If you can imagine I'm feeling a bit worn with the monotonous 8-10 hour knee stiffening flights, and I'm feeling a bit tired of LH just in general.

* What I'm asking is, from your experience, for the long haul flights, (I couldn't really care less about the shorter ones) is Lufthansa economy, or United economy PLUS better? I've never taken United on a long haul so that one's new to me. I do know if it was between econo, and econo, I'd stick with Lufthansa, but is the infamous American airline worth the sacrifice for the leg room on a 9ish hour flight?

I do know that Lufthansa is implementing a new premium economy, but I can only seem to get it for the outgoing itinerary. The return will only let me book business, which unfortunately is not financially an option.

I don't travel much so I'm not as familiar as I would like to be on what is okay or not. I will be traveling Delta from Birmingham AL to Orlando FL. I'd like to just have a carry-on vs having a checked bag. I will be gone for about 4-5 days. I'm currently looking for an appropriate luggage and am considering the Samsonite Silhouette Sphere 2 Softside 19 Inch Spinner which measures 19 x 7.5 x 14.5 inches. Delta's requirements are 45 linear inches (22 x 14 x 9 in) or 115 centimeters (56 x 36 x 23 cm) including handles and wheels...do you think this Samsonite luggage would be okay?

I know the hotel I'm staying at will provide at least a hairdryer, toiletries, and ironing board. Being a woman, I'll probably pack at least my flat iron. I've considered looking for a small steamer for my clothes though as I don't think all of my clothes would be okay to be ironed so any recommendations for that would be great.

I will need to pack make up of course. I think the rule is if it's any liquids, than it must be less than 3.4 oz right? And all liquids have to be in a 1 quart/liter zip top bag?

Oh and I'm already approved for TSA pre-check. I've never actually got to use it since I've been registered for it though.

Want to make sure I'm in the right before I give a customer service representative a hard time. 

My understanding is that the law does not apply for the TPA-->ATL portion of the flight (Delta potentially covering hotel costs, notwithstanding). 

However, the delay meant that the rest of the journey was a mess of delays, too. I missed the connection for ATL-->AMS, so I had to fly ATL-->JFK (Delta). Then I flew JFK-->AMS on KLM (delayed 20 min departing, 1 hour landing). Then I was supposed to fly AMS-->AAL, but missed the connection because of the prior delay, and rerouted AMS-->CPH instead. Then that flight was delayed 1 hour, and arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes late, causing another missed connection in CPH. The final flight didn't get me into AAL until 22:00 on May 4. My original arrival was 17:50 on May 3.

Do I have a claim that is simply being refused by KLM? Or am I just falling between the cracks of this law? I.e., cumulatively, the experience is well within the time constraints of the law, but individually each flight might not be...


EDIT: ""AMS-->AMS"" to ""ATL-->AMS""

EDIT 2019-06-29: Worked! 600 per person en route to my bank account. They would not give me anything because they kept focusing on the TPA or ATL origins. They shut down my ticket after I kept telling them that they should focus on the European section of the journey. I simply resubmitted a ticket that started with the flight from JFK (operated by KLM to an EU destination), instead, and they asked for bank details. I also had to scan and upload a letter from my partner authorizing their compensation to go to my account (I paid for both tickets), along with a scan of their passport."

Is it possible to fit a couple of days in Siem Reap / Angkor Wat in there?

I understand that it might be cold in Hanoi and Ha Long bay, but it should be ok compared to where we're coming from, Montreal, and from what I have read here and elsewhere, Halong bay is a must.

We plan on bringing enough instant formula bottles to feed him at the airports and on the planes and will stop to get more when we arrive for the time there. I have been told that feeding him or giving him a pacifier during takeoff/landing will help him remain calm during the flights, so I plan on doing that.

I am trying to save money on baggage fees, so my plan is to have my wife check the main suitcase filled with her and our son's stuff and I will bring a medium sized backpack filled with my clothes as a carry on. This means that we will be checking the stroller and the suitcase, but carrying on her purse, my backpack, the car seat, and a diaper bag.

This is the first major trip like this that I will be taking with our new son, so I am trying to cover all the bases.

She travels a lot for work and I try to get her to use one world whenever possible, but sometimes she will pick Southwest or Delta just because it is more convenient. That's fine. It's her life. But right now we are looking at summer vacation tickets to Europe. The one world Alliance tickets are extremely expensive at the moment. Perhaps they will drop, especially since the euro is doing poorly against the dollar, and of course the airlines are raking in record profits, but on the other hand they may not drop the prices if they can sell them for these exorbitant prices.


There are some other airlines which are a few hundred dollars cheaper to our destination, such as Icelandair and the Portuguese airline TAP. But they have some drawbacks in terms of the itinerary , and also we would be losing quite a few miles. Now the important thing about having miles for me is keeping my status, because I like having the free main cabin extra seats , as well as boarding first and all that other crap. I rarely used my miles for award tickets, although we have and it has saved us a lot of money. 

So I'm wondering whether should pay perhaps 200 or $300 more per ticket to fly with one world then with one of these non Alliance Airlines, like Delta or Swissair.

40,anyone ever tried this travel hack?,13,gdfp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/gdfp6/anyone_ever_tried_this_travel_hack/,28,2011-03-29 01:32:02,"this summer i'm going to barcelona, amsterdam, prague, and lisbon.  i've been checking flights for landing in barcelona and departing amsterdam to come back home.  it's running around $1300 right now, which is a little high for me.  last year i booked a similar trip for around 800.  

so anyway i tried searching a round trip to barcelona and it has a layover in amsterdam.  it's only $900!!  so why not just get off there and start my vacation in AMS then eventually make my way to barcelona when i want to catch my return flight?  is there any penalty for doing this?  would delta void my return flight or anything?  

if there's no problem, then i'm booking the flight tonight.  it's like $400 cheaper to book a round trip to barcelona than a multi-city flight."
41,Questions for those who have gone on an African safari...,5,2yohch,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2yohch/questions_for_those_who_have_gone_on_an_african/,28,2015-03-11 18:21:56,"Hello fellow travelers! We're contemplating a safari in Botswana for next year, and the amount of info out there about safaris is totally overwhelming. May I please ask a few questions in an effort to narrow it all down a bit?

Which country did you do your safari in?
What time of year did you go?
How much (approximately) was the safari portion of your trip?
Was it worth the money?
Did you enjoy (and trust) the tour company you went with?
What could have made the safari better for you?

I've been to Tanzania and Zanzibar (2010), but didn't have time to do a safari when I was there. I'd love to see a different part of Africa, and the opportunity to see the Okavango Delta has come up for April 2016, but I'd love some personal perspectives on other travelers' experiences. 

Thanks so much!"
42,"24F American planning a two week Europe trip, looking for feedback on my itinerary",2,6bql2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6bql2p/24f_american_planning_a_two_week_europe_trip/,26,2017-05-17 22:31:52,"Hello Travelers! I am planning a 2-week trip to Europe in early November. I’m American and this will be my first time in Europe (though I’ve traveled extensively in other continents). I’d love some critiques and recommendations on my draft itinerary. I will be meeting my brother who is studying abroad in London for part of his fall break. Destinations were chosen based on being iconic travel destinations, recommendations from friends, and proximity to one another. 

* Days 1-4: London (with brother)
* Days 5-7: Paris (with brother)
* Days 8-9: Amsterdam (with brother)
* Days 10-12: Copenhagen (solo)
* Days 13-16: Berlin/Frankfurt/Other? (solo)

A few things to consider:

* **Germany:** I’ve heard amazing things about Berlin and everyone I’ve asked has said it’s THE place to go in Germany. However, for some reason flights to NYC from Frankfurt are a lot cheaper and faster than from Berlin. I’m considering cutting my time in Berlin short to go to Frankfurt for a couple days and fly out from there, or maybe cutting out Berlin altogether. Or even choosing an entirely different final destination. I’d appreciate any input on this. 
* **Safety:** I’m 24F, not concerned about safety with my brother but for the solo legs I want to make sure wherever I go is safe for a woman traveling alone. From what I’ve heard this shouldn’t be an issue in major European cities. I won’t have working cell service but I’ll be able to use my phone over Wi-Fi. I can string together a few basic sentences in French, Spanish, and German.
* **Airfare:** I have 130k Delta miles and Platinum status. I’m hoping this will be enough to cover my flight to/from (based in NYC) and most of the travel between cities. I’m pretty sure I can use my status to get a free checked bag on partner airlines (main ones will be Air France and KLM). I also have AMEX points which can be transferred to British Airways. If needed I don’t mind paying out of pocket for a flight (or train if it makes sense) as long as it’s affordable and I can avoid excessive fees. Will probably use a bag sized 22x14x9 (inches) which I know may not fit European carry-on requirements. Will probably make a new post in /r/awardtravel but feel free to comment if you have any perspective on using Skymiles in Europe. 
* **Lodging:** I have 170k Marriott points and 50k SPG points. Planning to use these up on lodging. If a city doesn’t have a Marriot or SPG property or if I run out of points I’ll book AirBNB or a cheap hotel. Transferring AMEX points to Hilton rewards is also an option.
* **Budget:** Since the majority of my trip is subsidized with points I’m not very concerned about budget. I’d obviously like to avoid excessive expenses but I don’t mind splurging a bit to make the most of the trip. Would like to keep expenses below $2000 USD if possible. 
* **Interests:** With my brother we will be doing partying and drinking but also seeing the typical sights, museums, and enjoying the food. By myself I will do less crazy nightlife stuff and more walking around, taking in the sights, and maybe the occasional drink at a bar. TBH I’m pretty introverted but I’m open to making new friends to hang out with as long as I’m able to retreat back to my hotel if I want to do my own thing or if I’m getting a creepy vibe. 


I know I’m not spending a lot of time in each city. I’m really trying to cram as much into my 2 weeks as possible, but spending enough time in each city to not feel super rushed. I’m very flexible with my itinerary and willing to adjust based on recommendations, the only things set in stone are the first 4 days in London (need to meet up with my brother and visiting universities) and spending at least a day in Copenhagen (planning to meet up with an old friend). Thank you in advance for any critiques or recommendations!

I am very new to Reddit. I have to fly this weekend and my boyfriend insisted we fly Spirit despite all of my hours of objecting and crying because it was $200/ticket cheaper than the other options. I am terrified of flying, 100% absolutely terrified I will die. Finally, with the help of a lot of prescription medication, I have found a way to actually get myself on real airlines like Delta. However, I am petrified to fly spirit. How can it be so cheap? I checked and it has very low safety ratings. Should I just bail and buy a separate ticket on Delta? I don't care about the extra cost or anything with Spirit, I'm just scared I will die if I fly on it becuase it is unsafe. Am I being crazy? Is there anything I can do? Or is Spirit as horrifically unsafe as I expect?

45,Delta Airline racial profiling,28,6xduu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6xduu6/delta_airline_racial_profiling/,26,2017-09-01 15:12:47,"My friend Mo (whose parents are Egyptian) and I are on our way to Philadelphia for our friend's wedding, flying directly to Philly on a Delta Airlines flight. My name had been randomly selected for a security check, so all my bags were searched before boarding. No issues there. Later Mo and I are sitting in our seats on the plane, and take off is in 15 minutes, when an air hostess comes to us and tells us that Mo was randomly selected for a check and he needs to get off and bring his bags with him. I smirk, amused at how 'random' this check is. Only one person, the only Arab on the flight, was ""randomly"" selected for a check - whilst already on our plane and minutes away from take off. He makes a joke asking they don't leave without him to which they say they won't. Mo goes with them, I wait in my seat.

5 minutes later the woman comes back, tells me that Mo has set off some kind of security alarm, and that we need to take our bags off. Apparently some explosive alarm set off, so we need to wait for the police and we will therefore likely miss our flight. I mention racial profiling to which she says it isn't and this is normal procedure (I don't see any other white people being taken off the flight). The police arrives, as expected find nothing, and the flight is still there but they tell us we can't get back on, and our suitcases have already been removed.
We are then put on a later flight which isn't direct and involves a connection, lands us 9 hours later than originally planned (in the process ruining all of the plans we had made for that afternoon/evening). I then ask if we are getting an upgrade or anything to which I get told no.

I am absolutely fuming about this and think this is absolutely appalling. Does anyone know if there is anything that can be done?"

The bullshit is, my local airport does not have a Korean Air office, and my first flight is with Delta to Dallas ft. Worth, which happens to be the nearest Korean air office. Their customer support people were acting like a bunch of asshats, and it seems the only option is for my family member and I to drive all the way to Dallas to get this sorted out, which is about a 6 hour drive.

They said they could refund the ticket, but the new one would have to be purchased at today's prices, if even available. I will never use Korean Air again if I can avoid it, because that policy is absolutely insane.

49,"Planning 15 hour Paris layover. Please help, will be first time solo travel and using a metro!",1,8ry05g,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8ry05g/planning_15_hour_paris_layover_please_help_will/,25,2018-06-18 12:51:24,"Hi all, I'm an American travelling to Paris in two days and I have some urgent questions that I need help sorting out please. My plan is to explore the city during my 15 hour layover. It will be my first time ever travelling alone so I don't really know the nuisances of international travel and getting through the airport. I also have some questions about the metro. I've tried to do research before posting this, but I have never been in a metro in my life so I really don't understand when people write out their explanations. 


So first, my airport questions. I will be arriving in Charles de gaulle airport at 7:30 am my flight to Istanbul leaves at 10:50 pm (at night the same day). I called Delta and first they said my luggage would be checked through to the final destination (all flights on the same itinerary), but then I asked the employee to ask a survivor and they say if the layover is more than 12 hours, I must claim my baggage. I've seen conflicting answers on Reddit. 

Does anyone know which is right? In the event that I must claim my luggage, is it safe to assume I can just use the luggage storage service near the RER station? Once I arrive in the airport, the Delta agent on the phone said I can first check in for my flight to İstanbul and then leave the airport and explore. Is this recommended (will it save time)? Will they take my luggage in that case (probably around 8:30 am)?  Does this mean I will first have to go to terminal 1 to check in and then go the RER station in terminal 2? Or can I check in for my flight anywhere or even on my phone. If I already have all my boarding passes, do I even need to check in (isn't check in just to get the boarding pass)?


For getting to Paris, I know I take the RER b train. But then I need to switch to RER c? At which stop does this take place? So for example, if I want to visit Sacre Coeur, the RATP app is telling me to take Rer b all the way to Gare de lest Noctilien and then take a train from that station to Anvers. Is this the fastest way? But plugging in CDG to Anvers on rome2rio, it says to take RER b to Paris Nord and then walk. How do I know which is better or right? How do I plan the routes to take? 


I saw on this website that there are strikes going on, https://parisbytrain.com/paris-rer-train-strike-2018/. Should I be worried about this if my date is not planned to be a strike date? If it is, should I ditch my plans?


Does anyone have any recommendations or can provide me a link for a guide on what to see and in what order to see these things to maximize efficiency? I don't mind walking long distances. I just want to be able to see as much of Paris as possible. I saw a video by Jay Swanson covering the Eiffel tower, Louvre, Notre Dame, Arc de triomphe, Moulin Rouge, and Sacre Coeur. But most of it seemed to be using the metro and I feel I could see more if I walked most the trip. I mostly interested in seeing historical places and maybe trying some great food!


On returning to the airport, I just have to look for an RER b train because they all go to the airport, right? Since my flight leaves at 10:50, at what time should I plan to be back in the airport. 7:50? And if I need to recheck my baggage in, how early should I be back?


Thank you for all of the help in advance! Sorry for all the questions, I'm just really stressed! I've never traveled alone before and I've never used a train/metro. But I'm so excited to explore Paris!

50,Vietnam/Cambodia Travel Advice Needed,8,74uivj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/74uivj/vietnamcambodia_travel_advice_needed/,25,2017-10-07 16:12:41,"Hi everyone,

My boyfriend and I are going to Cambodia then Vietnam for a month in December, and are in need of a few travel tips. We are in our early 20s and have been to Vietnam previously. We love good food, culture, and history. We have a mid-range budget, but don't mind spending more if it is worth it. We are fit and active, but don't like doing anything too intense. 

In Cambodia, we are after advice on:

- We want to see the sunrise and sunset at Angkor Wat. Is it best to do a tour of the temples, or explore them on our own? We have 2 full days free for this.
 
- What is the best transport company to go with in Cambodia? We were thinking busses. We need to get from Siem Reap to Battambang, Battambang to Phnom Penh, and Phnom Penh to Kampot. 



For Vietnam, we are after advice on:

- Recommendations for food on foot tours in Hanoi, Hue and Ho Chi Minh
- Cooking classes in Hoi An

- Mekong Delta and Can Tho tours from Ho Chi Minn (not involving an overnight stay)

- Sapa local tour (we already have transport and accommodation, we just need someone to show us around for one day)

- We are considering a day trip from Hue to Phong Nha. It will be cold in December and we are not overly adventure people, and the tours we have found involve 4h there and back and seeing one cave, so don't seem worth it. Any advice around Phong Nha, or alternative things to do in/near Hue would be appreciated.


Thanks for all of your help in advance! 

**Edit: we are not comfortable driving motor bikes/scooters. We don't do this at home and don't want to do it in another country. "

tl;dr: **[There is no Golden Rule to Cheap Tickets](http://i.imgur.com/MmafaCJ.png?1)** from [here](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/02/travel/20-travel-mistakes/index.html). Use all these resources:

1. **Use [ITA Matrix](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/)** and compare with the rest: [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.com) and [Kayak](http://www.kayak.com) for aggregation. [Google Flights](http://www.google.com/flights/). Google owns ITA. [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com) - Redditor-made, and presented in time-bars. [Adioso](http://adioso.com/) - simple and flexible searching. [For simple one-ways or round-trips, look at Routehappy](https://www.routehappy.com/). [Momondo](http://www.momondo.com/) - another alternative.

2. See **[WikiVoyage for discount airline](http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Low-cost_airlines)** info. For example, there's [RyanAir](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xg6qc/ive_built_a_ryanair_fares_search_engine_its/), [Air Asia](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xhg2z/similar_to_the_recently_posted_ryanmonth_ryanair/)

3. Book the flights on the **official airline site** or on expedia/orbitz - whichever one is able to replicate the flights you found on ITA Matrix. If not, call your local travel agent.

4. Booking flights on two separate tickets *can* be cheaper than booking it all on one ticket - especially if you can use discount airlines. **Caution**: if your initial flights are delayed, your next flights are not protected - it will be considered missed - so **do not book tight connections on separate tickets**. See: [General guidelines for connections](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1v6zum/faq_beginners_guide_to_airports_and_flying/cepxp1f).

5. [Other tips on booking complex itineraries](
http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19co44/flight_help_global_health_research_in_wenzhou/c8myi5z). Consider [departing from a major hub](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1v6zum/faq_beginners_guide_to_airports_and_flying/cepgj3f) (and driving there) instead of your regional airport.

6. Don't know when and where to go? Use [Kayak Explore](http://www.kayak.com/explore) or the ""Everywhere"" destination in [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.com) or [Google Flights Explore](https://www.google.com/flights/explore/) to get an idea.

7. Need to book around country-based travel restrictions or country-based pricing? Try [Expedia Japan](http://www.expedia.co.jp/) for Yen pricing or [Expedia Canada](http://www.expedia.ca/) for CAD pricing. Most airlines also offer country-specific sites. More details about sales city below.

8. [Take a look at this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/19zwm1/flying_to_japan_late_july_advice_on_cheapest/c8t1pvx) which shows the progression of ticket prices from 2 weeks to 4 months prior to departure date. It's a single sample, but it's a pretty good demonstration of the 4-8 week rule. [**This study done by ARC**](https://www.arccorp.com/news/pr20120117.pdf) shows that prices starts dropping at the 3-month mark, with the cheapest tickets ranging from 3 weeks to 10 weeks in advance.

9. Start searching around 3 months in advance and monitor your flight prices **every day** until it drops to a level you're comfortable with. If the price rises, you have to commit to a maximum price you're willing to pay. This isn't a science. [An example of an experiment I conducted](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/19zwm1/flying_to_japan_late_july_advice_on_cheapest/c8t1pvx).  [Explanation of ""when to buy""](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pkl3z/can_we_get_a_few_links_into_the_sidebar/c4z0ago). And [this stackexchange post](http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2952/flight-tickets-buy-two-weeks-before-even-during-holiday-seasons) reinforces my comments.

10. Why prices differ for the same Economy Class ticket: the [general idea behind fare basis codes](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/11elam/i_just_want_to_use_my_own_airport_yvr/c6lvjhh) - the reason why round-trip flights can sometimes be cheaper than one-ways: [one-ways are usually on a more expensive fare basis](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10kayv/why_is_it_that_a_oneway_plane_ticket_costs_me/c6em9jf). /u/sataimir explains [Fare Classes](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lhn2z/nice_try_delta/cbzlr7r) ver well.

11. Student? Try your luck at [STA Travel](http://www.statravel.com/) or [Student Universe](http://studentuniverse.com)

12. [Flying last minute is vastly more expensive than planning ahead](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/wct00/another_question_about_flying/). Airlines typically close down the ""discount economy"" ticket sale window around 1-2 days before departure. Flying standby *can* result in lower costs but only if you don't care *when* you go nor *where* you go (still rare). Always plan ahead if you know you need/want to fly somewhere. [More here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g8fbi/do_airlines_sell_tickets_last_minute_for_empty/cahuelm)

13. Use some [other tricks to airline booking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_booking_ploys). **Caution**: if the airline finds out, you can be charged the fare difference or your status/award miles earned can be invalidated as it can be considered a breach of the fare rules (""contract"") that most people don't read.

14. **Extending your stay in a connecting city**: Try looking for a flight with a connection, and book a multi-city version of that itinerary, but making the layover 3 days instead of 3 hours - [More details here](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1txm6z/wanna_see_more_of_the_world_heres_a_trick_i_like/)

15. Can I buy a flight (A-B-C) and only fly the B-C leg? **NO**. [This is not allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pkl3z/can_we_get_a_few_links_into_the_sidebar/c5dwmzm).

16. Give up searching for your own flight? Try [Flight Fox](http://flightfox.com/) and pay someone to do it for you.

17. ~~If constantly checking the same airline / travel agent site - browse in incognito mode (useless) or clear your cookies after every visit.~~ [bollocks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/)


**Just for clarification** since so many people get this wrong:

* **Immigration** is the control measure that prevents/allows you from entering or leaving the country.

* **Customs** is the control measure that prevents/allows from bringing stuff into or out of the country (i.e. ""imports"" or ""exports"")

**Region Specific Sites:**

* Australia: [Webjet](http://www.webjet.com.au/), [JetStar](http://www.jetstar.com)

* Japan (departing): A few travel agencies sell fixed-period, hidden airline tickets for a bit cheaper. Check out [HIS](http://www.his-j.com/Default.aspx) or [No. 1 Travel](http://www.no1-travel.com/). Beware, they do not include fuel surcharges and fees yet (so it does *appear* cheaper than normal)

* Hong Kong (departing): [Cathay Fanfares](http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/latest-offers/flights/fanfares/) for last minute deals - they are very good deals.

52,Last minute trip to Switzerland in December... help!!,5,a0ljn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/a0ljn0/last_minute_trip_to_switzerland_in_december_help/,24,2018-11-26 20:43:58,"Hey Everyone!

My fiance and I are both PA's and constantly work. We miraculously have the same week off in December and were looking to go to Europe. Initially we were going to do Amsterdam and Paris however my family is a little uneasy about us going to Paris with all of the riots. We have always wanted to go to switzerland and figured this would be a perfect time to go!

I have been doing a lot of research and put together this itinerary. I was hoping to get some feedback and see if we should do anything differently.

&#x200B;

**12/12 - Land in Zurich 9am**

chriskindlimarkt, bahnhofstrasse, boat cruise on the lake

**12/13 - Zurich --> Lucerne**

\- trains every 30 minutes. 45 minute train

chapel bridge, water tower, dying lion, glacier garden, old town, museggmauer wall. lake lucerne boat ride

**12/14 - Lucerne.**

golden round trip to mt pilatus (boat from lucerne to  alpnachstad) cogwheel train up. cable car to frakmuntegg  to kriens then bus to lucerne (i found out this is closed in December so will just need to take the cable car up and down via kriens)

**12/15 - Lucerne --> Interlaken**

\- 2.5 hour train

schilthorn (train to lauterbrunnen) piz gloria rotating    restaurant

**12/16 - Grindelwald --> kleine scheidegg --> jungfrau**

Ice Palace, eismeer station

**12/17 - Grindelwald**

relax. spa day?

train to zurich at night

\*considering going to Zermatt for the day however I'm not sure if that makes sense to just go for a day

**12/18 - Flight out of Zurich 1:15pm**

&#x200B;

We have been reading that people recommend staying in Grindelwald over Interlaken and would love some input on that.

We also really want to go dog sledding! Have been struggling to find a good company in a website that we can understand.

Any tips on places to eat that aren't insanely expensive? we plan to stay at hotels that offer free breakfast to save in that way.

&#x200B;

I should also mentioned that we are young, very active and fast paced! We don't plan to ski or snowboard. Flying standby with my grandpas delta pass and will most likely get first class from the look of things right now, and therefore should sleep well the majority of the flight.

54,Going on a three week trip to Cambodia/Vietnam. Any recommendations?,4,ewrp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ewrp0/going_on_a_three_week_trip_to_cambodiavietnam_any/,24,2011-01-05 22:34:45,"Leaving Jan 20th. The plan is to fly into Cambodia, see Angkor Wat and the surrounding area, then make our way south to the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam before heading all the way north to Hanoi over land, ending in Ha Long Bay. I'm looking for any suggestions of places to stop/see along the way. I'm an avid birdwatcher and nature photographer so national parks are a priority. I'll be traveling with one other, and we're both looking to see as much as we can for as little money as possible.

EDIT: 
The real problem I'm having is trying to decide if I want to limit my trip to Cambodia, because it seems like there are so many wonderful things to see and do there. We will have 15-16 days total, and we were hoping to do Cambodia and Vietnam (or Laos), but I suspect this might make the trip overly difficult and unpleasant. If you were planning your first trip to SE Asia and only had a little more than two weeks, what would you do? We have already purchased our tickets into Cambodia - and we were thinking about flying out of Hanoi (or Vientiane if we go through Laos). I'll be traveling with one other who is not as into birding as I, so we would want cultural experiences as well. I'm sure we would not get bored with two weeks in Cambodia, but could we reasonably do more and not feel like we're rushing it?

EDIT 1/15/2011:
Now looks like we are axing the vietnam/laos option. There is just so much awesome stuff to do in Cambodia, and we don't want to stress about the travel. So I guess we're now looking for more suggestions of things to do in Cambodia. We will have 15 full days starting 1/22 in Siem Reap and leaving out of Phnom Pehn."

A week or so ago, tornadoes hit near Atlanta, completely snarling airline traffic. My flight to India was the next day. Understandably, Delta had to reroute my flight through United/Lufthansa. No problem, I even got upgraded on the way to Frankfort. Unfortunately, they decided to change my return tickets without notifying me, so I wasted 3 hours last night running all over Delhi airport because nobody could find the ticket that I paid for. Finally, I was able to reach my travel agent and she helped Delta figure out their screw-up. I ended up having to be escorted through the diplomatic queue in customs so I could make my flight. (Side note: don't try to hug a Indian woman to thank her. They don't like it)
Anyway, here I sit in Heathrow, waiting for my flight back to 'Murica so I take to the twitters to voice my displeasure. Hilarity ensues:

I was looking up flights to Korea from USA. I live in Louisiana so there would be 1 stop regardless going to Korea. The cost from Louisiana with 1 stop would be $1404 with delta. 

I found a cheaper option however it would be on separate tickets. I’m a member of TSA prechecked so I use it for domestic flights. I was wondering if this would be a good idea since it is on separate ticket. there is a nonstop flight to Seoul from Los Angeles for 800 at 5:50PM. Southwest airline has a flight arriving in Los Angeles for 9AM. That would give me 8 hours to make the connection. The flight going home is also the same. Would it be a good idea to book the ticket like this? The cost would only be $1000 after all flights are booked instead of $1404. What do you guys think about the separate ticket for this travel?"

Trying to get opinions on my itinerary and/or suggestions on places to eat and/or drink, additional things to do inside and outside of Paris.  We arrive Nov. 4 - Nov. 12.  Seven full days, two half days.  Yes, I know I bought plane tickets way early, but I think I got a good deal regardless.

I've been to Paris once about 8 years ago, was there for a month on a study abroad program.  This will be my husband's first time in France.  We've both been to other parts of Europe.  We like art, history, music, food, photography, wine/alcohol, unique experiences...  Not big on shopping, clubbing, or anything like that.  (We do enjoy grabbing drinks in the evening in more relaxed settings.) 

**INFO**

We aren't big breakfast people, so we will grab something from the grocery store or pastry shop.  Lunch will likely be whatever street stall we find or picnic lunch from the grocery store.  Dinner will be sit down restaurants most, if not every, night(s).  I'm thinking that $1000 USD will be enough for the food budget for two people. This will give us about $10 USD (8 Euro) each for breakfast, same for lunch, and up to $40 USD (33 Euro) each for dinner.  I'm aware that we may go over the food budget by a $100 or so and that's fine.  I'd like to aim low to start.  Though I think $500 per person is doable without giving up much for us.  I know we'll end up buying a bottle of water here and there or an afternoon treat (lookin at you Berthillon!).

Since I mentioned food... any restaurant recommendations in the Bastille area would be appreciated. Nov 2 is our anniversary so we would like to celebrate a belated anniversary in Paris with a nice meal... nothing crazy expensive... and doesn't necessarily have to be in this neighborhood, but that's where we plan to stay and I know there are many good restaurants there.

We will likely do the museum pass (4 day) at 62 euro each ($76 USD) mostly because of the skip the ticket line feature... and, of course, the potential for it to save a few dollars if we are able to make it to all the sites we want to see.

I'm thinking that the weekly Navigo pass is probably the best way to go for 22,80 euro pp (plus 5 euro for the card) and then the train to/from CDG for 9,50 euro pp.  So we'll spend 37,30 euro ($45 USD) per person on transportation.  The start/end days for the weekly pass aren't perfect, but I doubt we will really use the metro much during our first and last partial days in the city.

**BUDGET**

Airfare: $1370

Accomodations: $800

Food:  $1000

Museum Passes:  $152

Other Attractions:  $50

Transportation:  $90

Souvenirs:  $50

TOTAL:  $3,512 USD

I'll consider this our minimum budget.  Add another couple hundred dollars if we end up taking a class or a day trip outside the city.  I did leave out the cost of the meal for our anniversary for now.  Anything else I am forgetting?  Aiming to keep everything under $4,000 USD though I am aware that the euro to dollar exchange rate change before our trip.

**BASIC SCHEDULE**

**Arrive Sunday, Nov. 4 @ 1:30pm.** (*note below)

* Attempt to get museum and metro passes before leaving airport.

* Take RER or something to where we will stay.

* Snack/shower/rest.

* Wander around a bit, scout out things like closest grocery store.

* Possible dinner at L'Alberge du Louver.  I picked this place because I have been to it and the food seemed good for the price.  (Just skimmed Trip Adviser reviews and it appears they still have a prefix menu for around 19 Euro which fits into my approx dinner budget)  I also think it's good to have dinner picked out for the first night... avoids some hangry arguments on a public bench.  Open to other suggestions.

* After dinner we can walk over to the river to get a view of the Eiffel Tower lit up at night.

**Monday, Nov. 5**

* Start museum passes at Louvre. Any tips for navigating this place would be greatly appreciated.  I never did find the Dutch painters last time I was there.

* Attempt to leave around lunch time, make our way over to Eiffel Tower, have a picnic lunch. No desire to go to the top.

* Use passes to go up Arc de Triomphe.

* Musee Rodin or Musee de l'Orangerie (short visit, mainly interested in Monet).

**Tuesday, Nov. 6**

* Catacombs.

* Maybe Musee de Cluny?  Then the Pantheon since it's in the area.

* Musee du quai Branly???

**Wednesday, Nov. 7**

* Use passes at Sainte Chapelle.  Go early, avoid excessive lines.

* Notre Dame.  Consider going up the towers with museum passes depending on lines.

* Pompidou Centre... might do this before Notre Dame.

**Thursday, Nov. 8**

* Sacre Coeur, look around inside and maybe climb to the top.

* Wander Montmartre and have lunch.  Picnic lunch outside the Basilica?

* Back to the Louvre for a chunk of the afternoon.

* If there is time, and we haven't done it already, check out the Pantheon or Musee de l'Orangerie

**Friday, Nov. 9**

* Not opposed to taking a trip outside the city on any of these last 3 days, just a little overwhelmed with options right now.  I know there is Versailles, for some reason I'm not super interested... though I could be convinced.  Chartres is a possibility.  We were supposed to go last time as a class but decided not to since they had just started the restoration of all the stained glass in the cathedral.  I assume they are finished with that by now.  Omaha Beach or Mont Saint Michel also seem interesting, but I don't know if one of those is too much to squeeze into a day trip.
Any suggestions welcome.

* We could also just spend the day getting lost, lazily taking in the atmosphere of the city?  Or do some sort of guided tour or class?

**Saturday, Nov. 10**

* There's a popup flea market type thing in the 14th that I'd like to hit early.

* Maybe Palais de Tokyo (it's easy to get burnt out seeing too much historic stuff).

* Catch up on missed sites/activities from earlier in the week.

**Sunday, Nov. 11**

* Pick something to do from Atlas Obscura?

**Monday, Nov. 12 depart CDG @ 3:20pm.**

* We will have the morning to either sleep in, then relax with a long breakfast at a cafe... or cram in one more ""must see"" item on our list.

* Off to the airport around noon, I'm sure.



*So Delta canceled one of our flights... had to reschedule and we will now be arriving at 6am on Nov 4.  Suggestions on how to handle arriving that early?

Still undecided on whether we will get a hotel or AirBnB.  I feel like hotels are more likely to be willing to hold your luggage until check in, so that may end up being a deciding factor here."

I could really use some help planning a trip through Vietnam. I'm in the very early planning stage, so currently trying to work out time frame and where to go. Trip would likely be in the April/May time of year.

So basically my girlfriend and I (Canadian citizens) are looking to do a trip from the north to the south (or vice versa) by train. Would likely be starting in Hanoi and making our way down to HCMC/Mekong Delta kinda area. We were aiming for around 3 (maybe 4?) weeks but I'm not sure if that's realistic or not, any insight is greatly appreciated. Budget would be around 3-4k CAD, but hoping to spend less than that.

I've only just started researching, so I think/know that I'd like to hit Ha Long Bay, Hoi An, Nha Trang, Hue, and HCMC but I don't know too much else. What are some other towns/scenery spots worth working into the trip? I know very little so any advice from people who have done this trip before would be unreal. 

In terms of the type of destination, we're looking for interesting culture, good cheap food, half-decent hostels, and some killer scenery. Less touristy/off the beaten path is ideal. 

Thanks so much! Sorry for the vague questions I'm just honestly kinda bewildered at where to start with such a huge rich country.

Here is a bit of background information which should help:

- She is a US passport holder and has travel insurance for her trip.

- She is flying with Delta Airlines in her domestic flights but her flight to the UK is operated by Virgin Atlantic (We booked it all using delta.com though so it's a partnership thing I think).

- She is going from Charleston, WV to Atlanta, GA for a 2 hour layover. Then, she will be going onto London 
Heathrow afterwards.

- We plan to do the Online check in 24 hours before her flight departs so we can select her seats. 

I also have never flown on my own or been out of Europe so we would really appreciate some help, especially as a lot of you are frequent travellers. If the steps could start from me and her doing the online check-in and end when she has set foot in the UK, that would be even better. "

I am flying to India and am having a hard time finding a flight in my price range that doesn’t have super short layovers, this is the best I could find, thoughts?

Vancouver (YVR) - Minneapolis (MSP) 
4 hour 13 minute layover 
Minneapolis (MSP) - Paris (CDG) 
3 hour layover
Paris (CDG) - Chennai (MAA) 

So my questions.... 

 WhenI arrive in the US I will have to collect my baggage and recheck them correct? Will just over 4 hours give me enough time? 

I heard that the Paris airport (CDG) is an awful airport and getting from terminal to terminal is crazy... so is 4 hours enough time? Especially if the flight before hand takes longer than expected or leaves late or something? I am assuming I won’t need to collect and recheck my baggage here, is this correct? 

I’m buying my tickets through delta, but the flight from Paris - Chennai is operated by Jet Airways)

I am planning a honeymoon (albeit a bit last minute!). My fiancee has been to Spain before, but Morocco will be new to both of us. 

**Time frame:** Departing Oct-13 and returning Oct-25th

My current high-level plan is as follows:

* Dates Oct-13 to Oct-25


**Spain: Oct-13 to Oct-19** (Delta)

1. Arrive in Madrid -(Oct-14 8:00 am)
1. Train (raileurope): Granada Oct-14 to Oct-16
1. Drive to: Ronda Oct-16 to Oct-17
1. Drive to: Seville Oct-17 to Oct-19
1. Depart
	
**Morocco: Oct-19 to Oct-25** (Ryan Air)

1. 	Arrive in Marrakesh (5:30pm)
1. 	Marrakesh: Oct-19 to Oct-21
1. 	Desert Trip: Oct-21 to Oct-23
1. 	Marrakesh/Essaouira Oct-23/24 
1. 	Casablanca Oct-24 to Oct-25
1. 	Return: Oct-25 (7:40am)


What we are looking to get out of this trip is: Good food, new cultural experiences, some sensory sensations, relaxation, and maybe a bit of adventure.

We are usually pretty frugal, but since this is a honeymoon we have no problems splurging on things that are worth it (desert trip, 4/5 star hotels, riads, etc...)


I would love some feedback on the itinerary, the best modes of transportation, what cities to include/skip, etc.....

Thanks guys!

* **Ho Chi Minh City** - 2 days (3 nights) 
      - Tour of Chu Chi tunnels, Mekong delta river cruise. 

[Flight from HCMC to Nha Trang - £16]

      - Beaches

[Train, or hire taxi with driver with idea to stop at the My Son ruins en route]

* **Hue** - 3 days 

*  **Hanoi** 
     - Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre

Fly to Bangkok and then back to London

We are mainly looking for nice scenery, places to relax and good food/culture. Does this seem like a sensible (not too packed) itinerary? Also if anyone can suggest things to do in these places (or places to avoid for certain reasons).

I'm not really traveling far. I'm just going from California to New Hampshire and I'd like some advice.  
I've never traveled anywhere via plane, nor I have I gone on a trip alone. So, doing both the for the first time, at the same time, is a little more than intimidating.  
I have checked out the ITA matrix and I probably know where I'll be buying my ticket from there.  
I just saw that there is now a link to the beginners guide to airports, and I will be checking that soon. (It wasn't a link when I checked it a few weeks ago.)  
  
SO! My main question is:  
Are there any airlines I should avoid?  
I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?  
  
Any other tips that the beginners guide may not tell me?  
  
Any scams I should avoid? ie. ""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""  
  
I'll add more questions later, in the meantime any other advice you can give me from what I stated would be appreciated. If you have any questions for me I will answer them as soon as possible.  "

I had a great time with my family and friends but it’s difficult for me in the USA because here I only have my mother (father divorced and passed away a couple years ago) no other family. We aren’t very rich but we are not very poor so buying a ticket normally isn’t easy it takes a lot of working and planning.

My cousin works with Delta airlines and she said I could get a boarding pass and something with standby travel. I pay $500 and I wait for the plane to fill and they fill the seats. I feel bad for trying to ask her about it because she isn’t really nice and I cannot find information about it. I plan on traveling in 4 months the day after my graduation. If this $500 back and forth ticket is real this is really good for me because I can see my family a lot more and it won’t costs too much. 

In the USA I often feel anxious and depressed because of the fact I don’t have a family here. Yes I have my mom and she is my life but I need other family too. I go to a therapist and that usually helps for a couple days but being with family I had no issues. 

Does anyone have any idea about this whole $500 pass I don’t know if it’s a delta thing or any airline but I’m desperate to understand I know it’s in a LONG time but I wanna know if it’s real or false hope. This is really important to me because I want to see my family and have happiness before I go to college. "

My first idea is to cut some islands/beaches. I like them, but I don't want to beach bum for a full month. Which beaches can be skipped?

I've also heard Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville aren't that great. Opinions on this?

I'm thinking it's possible northern Vietnam will be cold and rainy when I come through in early February. I'm not sure how much this would improve by March though.

A final thought - I'd like to be on Ko Phagnan for a full moon or half moon party if possible.

Unfortunately, being busy with a recent long term breakup, school, and work has let me neglect actually planning the trip. I have no potential itinerary or idea of things to do other than just go. I worry I'll be a burden on my hosts as I seek out their advice continually for things to do.


My options are:

A) Go ahead & wing it, probably spending more than I'd like by booking tours/trains late 

B) Bite a $150 ""change fee"" from Delta, get back the rest of my ticket money in credit to spend through them within the next year with the chance to scope out a better trip, maybe focused around a music festival or something.


I'll still have 2 weeks off work regardless, and right now I am in a very spiritual finding myself again phase after getting out of a live in relationship of 3 years, so I would still spend my time travelling locally. I will be quitting my job and moving within the next year so I will have good opportunities to travel again if I take the cancelation route.

Would you more experienced travelers recommend I plan out a trip further down the line or go ahead with it?


edit: as a side note, the things I love in travel are experiencing new cultures, nature, exploration, and good natured parties (no raves/orgies). Would even saving this ticket money for somewhere else be better?

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for your overwhelming support, you caught me in a bit of a panic. Seeing every response so positive that I should go has made me more sure and confident than ever to take this trip, despite my lack of itinerary.

I'm currently booking a trip to Peru for my mother and myself. I live near Detroit, Michigan so I can book out of either Detroit (DTW) or I can take the four hour drive into Toronto (YYZ) to fly out of there if the cost is right.

I left out of Toronto for my last trip to Europe with Air Canada and the flight was great and I saved around $800. So, after seeing that I would be saving around $1,000 leaving out of Toronto this time I went ahead and booked that flight with Air Canada. I didn't realize until I was almost finished with checkout that there's a difference between Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge.

Seeing that I have 24 hours to refund my booking I went ahead and finished the purchase but now looking at reviews I'm getting really worried about the Air Canada Rouge flight (which is 8 hours). It looks like every single review recommend upgrading to premium seats which aren't great but better, the upgrade would be about $400 additional for myself and my mom.

My alternative option would be to book with Delta from Detroit for the extra $1,000 dollars. I should have enough Delta Skymiles points to pay for this flight (it would be all of my points, about 150,000 points) but I'm still spending about $600 extra in my miles to fly with Delta instead of Rouge. I wouldn't make this choice but flying with my older mom, I'm very worried she'll be miserable on the Rouge flight.

So I guess my question is how does Air Canada Rouge and Delta compare? I'm only really concerned with seat comfort. We can bring our own food and in flight entertainment. Any advice is appreciated! I have very little experience with international flights so I'm just not sure which would be better."

**Assumptions:** /r/travel is on a tight budget,  will pay the monthly bill, use the card for day to day transactions while traveling, wants flexibility in getting and using miles or points, may use the credit card for supplemental insurance or emergency assistance.

**Credit Cards for Points and Traveling**

NO travel insurance/assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 annual fee, waived for the first year. 15.99% APR, 0% first year.

* [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) - 40,000 bonus miles if you spend $1,000 in the first 90 days. Double miles on all purchases. $200,000 travel accident insurance. Trip cancellation/interruption coverage. Emergency Assistance.

     No foreign Transaction fees. $89 Annual fee, waived the first year. 14.99% or 18.99% based on credit, 0% for first year.

* [*United/Chase MileagePlus Explorer*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Chase+MileagePlus+Explorer) - 30,000 miles if you spend $1,000 on the first 3 months. 5,000 miles for an additional user. Double miles on United flights.  10,000 miles per calender year if you spend more than $25,000.  NO Travel insurance or assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 transaction fee, waived first year. 15.24% APR, NOT waived for first year.

**Other card considerations:** Other carrier specific cards (ie [Citi AAdvantage](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Citi+AAdvantage), [American Express/Delta SkyMiles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Delta+SkyMiles)) do not offer as much flexibility as other cards and have been disregarded. [American Express Platinum](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=American+Express+Platinum) has reduced their benefits and rewards over the last year without reducing the $450 annual fee. 

**tl;dr** I researched credit cards to be used for travel and found the [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) to be the best current option. What have been your experiences and what are your recommendations?

**Edit:** Someone pointed out these look like referral links so I changed the links to use ""Let me Google that for you"" instead.

102,December backpacking: South Africa or Japan?,19,5gabgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5gabgw/december_backpacking_south_africa_or_japan/,18,2016-12-03 19:32:57,"SO and I were gifted two round-trip, first-class tickets to any destination that Delta flies to non-stop. We are either flying out of NYC or ATL, so luckily there are ample destinations we could travel to. The catch is that our tickets have to be used by Dec 31st, meaning we must return on 12/31. We will be traveling from 12/13 - 12/31.

We have narrowed it down to either South Africa (flying into Jo'burg) or Japan (flying into Tokyo). We plan on backpacking either country, and have a budget of about $3500 USD. We are 22f and 23m respectively, and as such do not mind traveling on a budget. 

We're relatively active (as active as full-time university students can be) and are very social. Some things that interest us are: mountains, city nightlife, socializing with locals, and FOOD. 

This all being said, I'm looking for feedback on which country would be better to go to during these dates. 

For South Africa we'd fly to Jo'burg and would head to Cape Town to do the Garden Route and the Drakensburg mountains. Would love to splurge on a day at a game reserve as well. And the wineries!

For Japan we would fly into Tokyo, spend a few days there before heading out to visit cities like Kyoto, Osaka, Hakone, Shikoku (none of these are set in stone, just some destinations which sounded intriguing).

Questions:

1) Will Japan be horribly cold in the winter time? Are the Japanese still as social and active in the cold winter months (i.e. will there be things to do?)

2) Does anyone have any experience renting a car in South Africa? If so, how much did it run you and for how long did you rent it? Was driving in South Africa difficult?

3) My SO and I are interracial (native-american/black & white). Will we face discrimination in either country? (I understand that we run the risk of facing prejudice anywhere we go, but am wondering if either country is particularly unreceptive towards black/white couples)

4) How is the availability of convenience shopping for food in Japan? Will we be able to purchase items such as eggs, bacon, etc. easily?


Looking for any insight into either location for such an extended period of time in December! Thank you r/travel!

103,Crowd Sourcing Opinions - Which Option Would You Take?,1,8di5bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8di5bi/crowd_sourcing_opinions_which_option_would_you/,18,2018-04-20 01:05:15,"Hi All, thanks for the help on this. Basically just crowd sourcing opinions on potential flight itineraries as I haven't done a lot of transatlantic flying so hopefully someone can offer some advice.

Flying to Amsterdam from Orlando on July 6th and then returning from Frankfurt to Orlando on July 16th.

I've narrowed the flight options down to the following:

Delta in Premium Economy - Direct MCO-AMS 9hrs then FRA-DTW-MCO, total of 13.5hrs for $2,160/person

or

Lufthansa standard Economy MCO-FRA-AMS 12 hrs total, then direct FRA-MCO 10 hrs for $1928/person

I'm conflicted because I like the idea of premium economy on Delta, but also feel like I'd prefer to have the direct flight after vacation as opposed to before..

I've never flown Lufthansa at all and have not flown Delta on a long haul, so I've got very little to go on for what will be the best experience and most comfortable.. Mostly trying to think about my wife and having her have the best flight possible. I'm an aviation geek (am a private pilot) so I'm happy to just be flying.. but want to make the decision that will leave her most comfortable.

Thanks for any guidance/sharing of your experiences!

Edit: had the wrong price for the Delta flight

104,Would any of you experience travelers look over my credit/debit card strategy and let me know what you think?,1,23sv68,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/23sv68/would_any_of_you_experience_travelers_look_over/,18,2014-04-24 01:13:50,"From what I've read here, it's a good idea when traveling for many months to take at least TWO debit cards linked to two different accounts and not keep all your money in one account.  The theory is that if one account becomes compromised, you won't lose all your money and you'll still have funds to eat, sleep and buy a ticket back if needed.



So, here's my approach.  Please let me know if this is a good plan. Note: I already have one Schwab account and will open a second one.  If you don't know, the Schwab account is great for travelers because all ATM fees are refunded at the end of the month.

The plan:

I will take the following cards:

* Schwab debit/atm card, linked to account #1

* Schwab debit/atm card, linked to account #2

* Delta Skymiles Amex


Card 1 will be the one I use all the time to withdraw cash at ATMs.  When the account balance gets low, I will transfer funds from the secondary account.  I will only use the card linked to the secondary account if I lose the first card.


The credit card will only serve as a backup to be used in emergencies.



Am I overthinking this?

The Delta App says that my baggage is expedited and should be on its way to Lima tonight, 7/27, and then be on a connecting flight from Lima to Cusco tomorrow morning 7/28, but the second airline is a different carrier, LATAM. According to the Delta Tracker, it should arrive at the Cusco airport tomorrow morning at 5:00 am. The LATAM reps in Cusco said that I should come back to the airport tomorrow at 6am and my bags should be there if Delta transferred my bag. 

What do people recommend in this case? I have spent over an hour on the phone trying to get through with Delta, but no such luck. Should I just show up tomorrow morning at the airport and hope that the bag makes its way through? Kind of at a loss because I head into the mountains tomorrow afternoon and it will be increasingly harder to get my bag if it is not there tomorrow morning. Thoughts? Thanks in advance.

- Delta got us on an Air France code share flight to Boston, for minimal fare increase and waived the change fees, without a death certificate. 
- Airbnb fully refunded the unused, non-refundable expenses from our anticipated stay in Switzerland (with a death certificate) and followed up a few weeks later with an impressive basket of Lindt Chocolates and a nice letter to go with it. 

The letter:

**Full version:**
We had our end of summer trip planned and set to go back in April. We were traveling from the SF Bay Area to Germany, followed by Austria, Switzerland and France before heading back to Deutschland, to fly home. Original air travel was on Delta, round trip. We had Airbnb reservations set for Austria and Switzerland and had decided to figure out France (also via Airbnb), once we arrived in Europe and determined what areas of France we wanted to travel to. We were leaning towards Lyon and Strasbourg.

Our first morning in Salzburg, we received word that my wife’s mother passed away. We then went into get back to the US mode and contacted Delta to figure out how to get to the US East Coast. The agent was quite helpful and ultimately set us up on a flight, from Germany, to Boston via Paris on Air France. The fair increase was about $200pp USD, which I considered nominal, given the short notice and the day we needed to fly.  

I then contacted our host for the Airbnb reservation in Switzerland, just outside of Lucerne, and informed him of the circumstance and I would need to cancel. The cancelation policy was 5 days prior and this happened two days before the reservation. I expected the financial hit and left it at that. 

Once in Boston, as the fog of the situation started to settle, I started looking into the amount of funds I was going to lose via the Airbnb reservation and cancellation policy and came across a clause about Extenuating Circumstances. Contacted Airbnb and received a reply a couple days later, with a request for the death certificate. Sent that in one evening and before we awoke the next morning, I had a message indicating they refunded the full amount. Albeit somewhat surprised, I thought this was a good thing and they were customer oriented. 

But then the unexpected – Fast forward about three weeks later. This past Friday evening, after arriving home from work, I had a UPS box on the doorstep, which contained the basket of chocolates from Airbnb. This was a really nice gesture and my wife was especially touched.

Now I got an email, that at the 22nd of January 2016, they will expire if I don't do anything with them. My question is now, what the smartest way is to prevent them from expiring. My two options I currently see:

1. Donate 1000 miles to one of their partners, this counts as activity and extends the expiration deadline by 18 months after donating. That means, I'd donate beginning of 2016, *before* my miles expire and they'd be fine till summer 2017

2. Buy 1000 miles for $30, which would bump me above 50k miles overall, and therefore I'd be AAdvantage Platinum / oneworld Sapphire. If this is right, I'd benefit on my next flight from: 25% -> 100% bonus miles, 24h -> 72h upgrade confirmation, 1 -> 2 bag fees waived, priority baggage, limited -> free access to Main Cabin Extra seating, earlier boarding right after business/first class). Am I thinking this through properly? That would be totally worth $30. 

Another question: If I buy my SOs tickets with mine so that we're on the same reservation, would she benefit from some of that stuff as well? Or would she have to check-in in another lane than me, can't board earlier and couldn't make use of the speed security lane? And what about the 2nd bag fees waived? Only me or are they generous because she's on my reservation and flying with me? How does that work in general? How would the miles be accounted for. If we fly together, would I get the miles x1 or x2 when we fly on the same plane? 

Last question: In St. Louis, AAdvantage has fast security lanes. My next flight there will be both way via Delta. Will I be able to use the lanes, if I show my AAdvantage Gold card? Or will they check the tickets, too, and the benefit will only work if I fly with AA / oneworld?

As you can see, I'm quite new to this whole thing, and your help will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!! :)"

I am planning on motorbiking (solo) across Vietnam in March. I have never motorbiked but I plan to take lessons beforehand so I'm not totally out of the blue, as well as avoiding cities. Since it won't be for almost a year I have time to get ready. I know a lot of people don't get a license but from what I've seen getting an international driving permit is cheap and I'd rather pay for that than potentially getting into an accident and being in jail. Plus, with a license I can get insurance, for me it's worth it instead of taking the risk.

Anyway, my planned itinerary. Hopefully this isn't too ambitious.

3/4 - Arrive in Ho Chi Minh at 10:55 pm

3/5 - Fly from Ho Chi Minh to Hue, arriving at 7:00 a.m.
Start of the Ho Chi Minh Road (http://vietnamcoracle.com/saigon-to-hanoi-by-motorbike-5-suggested-routes/#3)

Starting in Hue as opposed to Ho Chi Minh for time reasons and it seems like Ho Chi Minh to Hue is the least scenic

Buy a motorbike and head off to Khe Sahn
3/6 - Khe Sahn to Phong Nha

3/7 - Explore Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park

3/8 - Phong Nha to Pho Chau

3/9 - Pho Chau to Cam Thuy

3/10 - Cam Thuy to Hanoi (bus)

3/11 - Hangout in Hanoi, overnight bus to Ha Giang

Start of Ha Giang Loop (http://vietnamcoracle.com/ha-giang-extreme-north-motorbike-loop/)

3/12 - Ha Giang to Meo Vac

3/13 - Meo Vac to Ha Giang, overnight bus to Hanoi

3/14 - Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh (flight)

3/15 - Explore Ho Chi Minh

3/16 - Mekong Delta

3/17 - Fly out of Ho Chi Minh at 11:05 pm

I purposely am leaving myself more time at the end to explore cities in case I have trouble on the road and need an extra day. I'd be okay with losing a day to explore a city if it means more time on the road. If I'm on schedule I'll probably spend an extra day doing the Ha Giang loop and not rush it.

So, is this doable? Am I being too ambitious? Does anyone have any advice or tips? I've been doing as much research as I can, Vietnamcoracle has been a god send but if anyone has anything else, let me know!"

So far, I know I will have $1500 for traveling but I’m not sure if I want to cap it off at $2000. 

The top 4 spots I have chosen are Iceland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Thailand; in that respective order. 

I was planning on going between August 10-20 as this will be around the time school starts up and when I’ll be off from work. These dates aren’t very flexible. 

I checked United, Delta, and Google flights, mainly focusing on google and saw Iceland ~$400 - 500 while the others exceeding that with I believe New Zealand being the most expensive at ~$1300 - 1500.

I have talked to some people about going (roughly 5) but I am not worried about going alone. It’s been well over a decade since I’ve left my state let alone the country and do not want to wait on anyone. I have looked and know for example r/visiticeland has people you can partner up with to split costs, but will look deeper into that in the later months. 


Some questions that I had were, will $2000 be enough? Of course for the larger priced tickets no, but I was wondering say for example, Iceland if I choose to go there will that be enough to be comfortable? If I did go with a group or alone I would try and split a car rental + gas and also live in a hostel for the time being. 

If it’s not, would December be a better time? I would have my winter break and would need to do more research on this but for now I’m planning on the August dates. 

Lastly, if you wouldn’t go to any of these places, what would you recommend?

She stepped to the side to call customer service and the man behind her with the same problem was granted a new boarding pass and let on the plane after complaining about missing a funeral. When my girlfriend asked why he was let on with the exact some situation she was told by the gate agent that he was let on for weight distribution reasons and that it was his discretion on who to let on.  (GF is 5""5', 120 lbs.)

After spending the last 6 or so hours on the phone, Virgin is blaming delta for a ""computer glitch"" that didn't update boarding passes in whatever database.

138,Travel Hints & Tips. How the airline industry works.,6,730arx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/730arx/travel_hints_tips_how_the_airline_industry_works/,16,2017-09-28 18:07:22,"**Before you read the post, keep in mind that may not be relevant for someone who travels a few times during the year domestically within the United States to see family or for work. On the other hand the article was based and targeting international travelers. This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing.**


Back in the 80s and 90s shopping for air tickets was so much simpler. The airlines used to offer 3 fares. One for economy, one for business and one for first (for the airlines that offered it.) Everyone traveling economy for example would pay the same. (so no one was upset for paying more than the person next to them or some cousin who was bragging that paid less…) The reason about this was that when the tickets were “paper” and were physical items most agencies would pre-purchase and then set a price of how much they wanted to sell for the traveling season. (which also leaded to black market too in some cases. Having strong ethnic agencies that used to monopolize their markets, buying huge amounts of ticket stock and selling it to higher prices with huge margin of profit since they could do that. They could buy lots of ticket stock, make reservations and be able to hold them for weeks (can’t do this now), or book fake names to hold the space in flights and then change the name to whoever was traveling since there was so easy and without fees to change the names of the travelers.


What changed?


The airlines hated the fact of scheduling flights that could cost thousands of dollars without knowing if the flights will be full and sometimes sending half empty planes. They removed the paper tickets and changed the game. They introduced the “classes of service”! If let’s say on a flight there are 300 seats, and the cabins are broken down to 30 business class tickets, 70 premium economy and 200 economy tickets, each cabin is broken down to classes of service. Economy for example, those 200 seats are divided to a dozen of different economy fares that change every 9 tickets are sold. Example 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F 9G. The first 9 people will call they will buy at the price of the A class that may be $800, next 9 travelers will pay the higher tier economy, B which may be $900 etc. The highest economy may be at $1800-2000 and this is the same cabin and the same seats that someone paid probably $800 or less. The way this system works, benefits the airlines since the travelers must rush and try to buy way ahead of time to make sure they ll get the lowest economy class of service or else they will end up paying way more. The travelers cant wait till last moment anymore when there was only one economy fare out there. So it is a game between all of us the travelers. Whoever calls first and the earliest gets the good fares. On top of that, when you make get a reservation now days, you cant hold it for more than 1-2 days. (before the agents could hold them for weeks). Not to mention the penalties. Most tickets are non refundable (with an exception of death). All tickets have penalties when you try to change them and the list going on. Keep in mind in domestic and international tickets, the lowest ones (lowest classes of service) come with some harsh rules behind them. Such as you don’t get miles or you can accumulate a very low amount of them. You are not allowed to travel with a luggage (unless you pay extra at the airport). Usually those tickets are non refundable and non changeable. (If you must change something, then you lose the ticket and you have to buy new one). Not to mention you can pre-select your seating assignment. 


When buying tickets be very careful. For domestic traveling always go directly to the airlines. They keep that portion of market for themselves. Which means, you aren’t going to get a better deal anywhere else. For international traveling though, all the airlines are giving a big portion of their deals and discounted fares to consolidators and wholesalers that they provide smaller agencies and websites with airfares. So when it comes to international traveling, then you may get a lower fare from an A Airline via an agency or a website than the airline itself. (Because the A Airline may have an agreement with the B travel agency to give them the right and sell their discounted deals). Many are complaining about the fares and fees. Well traveling is not a cheap “sport” any more. As about the competition, well, someone may say “but there are so many airlines”. True, but most of these airlines have merged into bigger alliances. The world’s major carriers have merged into 3-4 big groups that they expanded their “city service networks” and share price and policies. So instead for 20-30 airlines, they are basically 3. So for us the consumers, we get the one or the two of them from each city. (this mean we get 1 or 2 fares to pick from) The one or the other airline alliance. (some major cities are luckier because they may get all 3 alliances plus some other ethnic carriers that don’t belong to any of the big groups and they are just offering an extra choice of airfare. 


Seating Assignment has become a joke too now days. It used to be free, yet the past years the airlines discovered this idea to sell the seating pre-assignment. You buy your tickets on April to travel in June and you want to assign the seats. You have to pay a fee. (Makes me wonder what we will pay next). Luckily you can go get the free seat assignment at the airport the day of your departure.
Travel insurance. Often I get asked about it. Another way for the agencies to make profit. Most airlines and the trip insurances waive and forgive penalties if you are very sick. But only if you are sick. Neither the airlines nor the travel insurance will cover you for any other reason. (yet many don’t realize this and buy insurance anyways). Some major airlines will cover you and waive the fees if you are really sick, so no reason to buy any insurance. Unless of course you booked with one of the few carriers that do not accept medical reasons for cancellations or changes. Then it is worth it. Although most of the times it is a waste of money. You end up paying way too much and sometimes it is not needed if the airline covers you for medical reasons anyways. 
Nothing is guaranteed either. Penalties, fares, fees, all are subject to change. Even your paid seating assignment. Basically the airlines under their guidelines can do anything they want and you can’t do a thing about it. 


When you try to book keep in mind to search for at least 4-5 months in advance from the month you want to travel. (this is for international tickets, not domestic tickets within the U.S.) The airlines have introduced this term called “advance purchase” which it works to discourage travelers and overcharges them if they try to call within a week or two from their desired departure date to buy tickets. If let’s say an economy ticket cost $1000 (if you book it a month or more in advance). If you try to buy the same ticket within three or four weeks, or like sometimes people do, within one or two weeks the price skyrockets. That same ticket ends up costing $2000-$3000. So try avoiding booking within a week or two and last minute tickets. It was a time that worked well for deals, but not anymore. 


So what about the Special Sales?


Prices go down once in a while too, as sales/demand mandates. The airlines monitor their flights and once the sales drop, in order for the to fill the flights they release ""special sales"" to fill up the flights. Remember the goal is to send the aircraft full.


These hints and tips are applying mainly to the big carriers. (such as Delta, United, American, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, etc). Low cost carriers such as Spirit, Southwest, Ryan Air etc that sell tickets directly from their websites and not through any of the official reservation platforms around the globe, they are a different story and most of the above information isn't applying for them.


I am sure there are certain exceptions to all the above but this is how the airline industry works now days, the majority of the times. Hope it helps. Good ticket hunting."

Going to be 40 this year, and have been dreaming about this trip for over 20 years. Finally applied for my passport, and we have flats picked out in London and Paris. We know what we want to do, so no, AutoModerator, we aren't looking for advice for London or Paris.

My hangup is the flight.

I haven't flown much in my life, less than ten total flights. I have a bit of a height issue (I wouldn't call it fear), and I don't like not being in control. The safety record is well known to me, but still it persists. There's two areas that I could use some advice/feedback on.

**Comfort:** It takes a perfect scenario for me to get to sleep. I am a stomach sleeper, as much as I've tried to change that. I doubt I will be getting much sleep sitting up in a cramped seat, but I am trying out ANC headphones, pillows, etc now to see what might assist. I am of average height, so legroom isn't a huge deal. I'm not thin, but I also don't come close to overflowing  the confines of my seat. The more I can't fall asleep, the more anxious I get about falling asleep and it cascades. All the flights from Atlanta to London are overnight, which works for our itinerary, but I'm worried I will be a mess trying to function even until dinner time. The only other overnight flight I've taken was from SFO-ATL, and I slept perhaps thirty minutes. It wasn't very fun.

**Cost:**The above dovetails into price. I can find RT tix ATL-LHR for about $650 ($1300 for both of us) in lowest level economy via a third party off Skyscanner. Now, I've seen plenty of advice that says to book with the airline, but that bumps it up to $890pp. I could then upgrade off that if I care to. Premium Economy is running roughly double my original $650pp ticket. Is some more legroom worth double? Is being able to select your seat worth $110? We're hoping to travel light, just a carry on bag for us each.

I just have no frame of reference to know if the $650pp deal is good, to not buy third party, and if it's worth double to change from Economy Basic to Premium Economy (the carrier I am basing all this off of is BA, but it seems to be the same for Delta, et al). Since we've never really traveled, we have no loyalty, points, or anything other than currency to use. We hope this is the beginning of the second half of our lives traveling more, but we are starting basically from scratch. In a similar manner, I have no idea which airlines and which planes are better than others, only that a ton of people are not impressed with United.

I appreciate you reading this."

147,Asking airline to cancel one leg of my flight itinerary?,5,8i3v7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8i3v7p/asking_airline_to_cancel_one_leg_of_my_flight/,15,2018-05-09 10:37:54,"Hi, I'll call Delta tomorrow morning, because KLM canceled a flight, which didn't reflect in my Delta itinerary, and I just noticed by checking out of my spidey senses.  
In the meantime, I'd like some clarification.  
I bought a Tulsa - Glasgow roundtrip flight, very cheap. Tulsa - Atlanta - Amsterdam - Glasgow, then back home to Tulsa from Glasgow.  
I misunderstood hidden city flights, I suppose (because I've done this before), and I booked accommodations in Amsterdam. I intend to leave the Amsterdam Airport, and only go to Glasgow at the end of my trip to fly home to Tulsa.   
  
Can I ask Delta to cancel my Amsterdam to Glasgow flight? Tonight the customer service rep said if I miss any flight, they reserve the right to cancel the rest of my itinerary and put the tickets back up for sale. Very frustrating because I paid for the tickets and want to do as I please with them.  
  
I realize this is all posted on airlines' regulations, but I want to ask this community if I can be diplomatic with Delta to pull this off. Cheers"

The IAD to DXB leg was quite long so I decided to shell out and upgrade to BusinessFirst. That is where the nightmare begins.

After writing the following letter to Jeff Smisek, the CEO of united airlines, I received a phone call back. United thanked me for writing the letter, this of course after I was informed that the Lady I was talking to had been in the business for longer then I have been flying.

Here is the letter for your reading pleasure.

Dear Mr. Hand & Mr. Smisek, 

I recently flew on United Airlines from LAX to DXB to YYZ.  Along the duration of my flight’s there were a number of circumstances which led to this being the most awful travel experience of my flight career, which as a consultant I am in the air 48 weeks a year on business and another 2 weeks a year visiting family.

On my way from LAX to DXB, the flight attendant behaved in a very racist manner towards me, she served me my meal last and responded to any inquiries I had very rudely.  My request for a Halal meal lead to public scorn and embarrassment as your flight attendant very rudely informed me that the Halal meal needed to be ordered 2 hours prior to serving. I did in fact request the specific meal when upgrading my seat prior to departing LAX there seems to be a sort of disconnect within your company. Needless to say the mistreatment from the flight crew negatively impacted my travel experience. As a business first passenger there is a standard of treatment which I expect to be treated in.

But United, you guys never fail to disappoint. The return trip, has to be by far the worst experience I have had in life period. As is I am a 27 year old Muslim Male with a beard. So I am sure you could picture the already prejudice looks I get from, TSA, Airline Employees and fellow passengers. But nothing can top the actions of Ms. Lotta Von “Something” (I couldn't get her last name because when I tried she took her name tag off.)

Ms. Lotta Von X let’s call her, approached  me upon reaching 10,000 feet, Mr.Chagleelee was my name on this flight (I thought literacy was a requirement but OK). I said yes, she said we have the Muslim meal for you.  I said, thank you, but aren't all the meals out of DXB halal? And that is when all hell broke loose.
I was screamed at and publicly humiliated, and I was told that I was not allowed to have any of the meals on the menu because I ordered the Muslim meal.
After being shouted at I asked what was in the Muslim Meal anyway, the response was priceless “rice and curry or whatever you Muslims eat.” At that point I had enough, I began speaking to another Air Host and his apology was truly one of a kind. “Yeah, its ok she can come off like that”. As if expecting me to be patient and understanding with her. Then Ms. Lotta now comes back and refills my sprite with water, which then took her the duration of the flight to rectify because I never got another one from her. As a matter of fact, I had to get up and go the galley to get a drink.

The best part of all of this is that I was sitting next to a Senior Vice President of (Sorry I have to edit this out), who looked at me and said, “I am shocked, I have never seen anything like this.”

The final flight from Dulles to Toronto, there was no Premier access on boarding, no first class or Economy plus, and once again the Gate agent was extremely rude as well as oblivious and unable to effectively respond to my inquiries regarding the flight details. (Please do explain why I am paying an arm and a leg for this?)

My total flight time was around 30 hours which I would consider fairly long, as such I chose to upgrade in order to receive more comfortable seating as well as more personal service. Yes the seating was adequate however the horrific service provided lead me to reconsider my decision of choosing United Airlines entirely. I am an avid flyer and this is the first time I have experienced such poor behavior from crew members and the remainder of the airlines personnel’s.  It seems throughout my multiple flight’s there seems to be some common animosity from the crew members toward the Halal/Muslim meal displaying racist behavior. Would this be ordinary behavior to be expected by United Airlines, if so United Airlines will most definitely not be a part of my future travels plans. The saddest part of all this, this is the first United flight since accepting the premier match challenge. I think I will stay with Delta. In all the flights I have ever taken with them or any other airline for that matter, I have never been as appalled as to write a letter of complaint. I would like to thank you guys for giving me this opportunity to experience a new first.

Given that I do not think Jeff read the email, I sent it out to a couple more Directors and VP's.

I will be flying into Hanoi, spending just over 3 weeks exploring the country, and flying home out of Ho Chi Minh City.

I want to preemptively book some sort of a beach hut near Ho Chi Minh city, so that I have a place already booked in advance, and can just sort of arrive from the north, kick back, and relax before my flight home.

I have looked up popular beaches and have started looking at various resorts, hotels, guest houses, etc. and there's (obviously) a lot of options.  So I thought I'd ask here in case somebody might have some ideas for me.

- I will be saving money along the way staying in hostels, so I don't mind splurging a bit on something nice on the beach for the last couple days/nights in the country.  But if I find a nice hostel with private rooms, I want to consider that as an option as well, as I enjoy mingling with other backpackers.

- I want to stay somewhere that's close to some ""night out on the town"" type establishments in the evening..  so bars, pubs, restaurants, etc.  It doesn't have to be right next door, but I want to be somewhere where I can walk 5-10 minutes and be in the middle of party central.  Having said that I don't want to be right in the middle of party central, so that I can actually rest at night.

- I am still not sure how many days/nights I will spend in Ho Chi Minh before my flight home..  For now I'm going with 1-2 days max..    However, I also had thoughts to maybe check out the Mekong delta, if I have time, and make a day trip out of that.  I suspect I will be a bit tired from all the travel near the end of my trip and might just want to relax on the beach and not really spend more than 1 day exploring Ho Chi Minh and taking it in, but am open to suggestions.

Usually I book things as I go, but you can find much better deals on swanky beach resorts, beach huts, etc. if you book in advance.  So I want to take a look and see if I can find something that meets my criteria, but wouldn't mind some tips as to where exactly I should be looking.

I will be travelling 1-2 months from now.

During this time, two other flights left Vancouver bound for Seattle from WestJet and Air Canada.

At around 1950, the flight from Delta was cancelled. We were given red cards with a number on it, saying we could change our flights there. But we were also told that Delta would not cover hotels due to the cancellation being due to weather.

So what are my options here? I've bit the bullet and rented a hotel for the night - my wife has medical conditions and can't sleep on a bench. I was on the phone with delta for hours, but they pretty much told me I need to talk to someone on the ground, and all of them have gone home.

We have a small airport, from which only American Airlines departs.  There's a second airport used for chartered flights, but since I'm paying for this out of pocket I doubt I'll be using any of those.  There's also an Amtrak station.

There are two airports (Midway and O'Hare) in Chicago, each of which is about 2.5 hours away, depending on traffic.  There's another airport in Bloomington-Normal, which is about 1 hour away (and has no backscatter machines and parking is free).  Indianapolis is also reachable, and is about 2 hours away (though with the time zone change, if I start driving at 5, I arrive at 8; but if I leave Indianapolis at 5, I get back at 6).  BMI is usually cheapest; if not, MDW is.  Indy has never had the lowest fares.

There's a moderate to significant chance that I'll wind up moving to Chicago at some point, but I've been saying that for years; each time the option comes up, I remember I hate moving and stay put.

This year I'll be flying to Denver, Colorado on Frontier Airlines out of MDW, and am also tentatively planning a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana for early October (most likely on Delta from BMI); the problem with this strategy is I'm only picking the cheapest individual flight I can find on Hipmunk, which doesn't necessarily work to my long term advantage.

Next year I am 85% confident I'll be going to Sweden in July (most likely on KLM); other significant destinations of varying confidence intervals are Canada (probably Toronto), Seattle, California, New York, New Jersey, and South Carolina.  There may be more, but those are the ones to which I think I'm likely to fly.  I also know I'll be traveling to Iowa, Wisconsin, and Missouri, but those are drivable distances.

I don't care very much about getting status or flying exceptionally comfortably (or don't understand why not caring is a bad idea), just flying cheap with a minimum of civil rights violations.  I'm not currently taking advantage of any credit card rewards or frequent flier programs and don't know where to begin.

How can I minimize my average cost of flying over the long term?  This includes the cost of taking vacation days in order to travel, which is why I try not to drive places more than 4 hours away and won't drive places more than 8 hours away.  Similarly, I avoid Amtrak because it means taking a vacation day just to travel, even though the dollar cost is cheaper.

Good morning guys. I wanted to write my frustration with American Airlines. I live down in Miami, but I always drive up to Fort Lauderdale to fly with Southwest. this time,  I, along with my family, flew out of Miami to Chicago. Although I had to pay for bag fees, and dumb seat fees in order for us to sit together, the flight from Miami to Chicago was great.

 On our way back to Miami, we had a connecting flight at Charlotte. First, I paid again the crazy seat fees and bag fee, our flight from Chicago got delayed and lost the connecting flight. Then, they switches us to a flight that was going to Fort Lauderdale. That flight was getting delayed every 30 minutes since 9 p.m. They cancelled it at midnight with the same bad weather excuse, and told us to go to customer service to change it. They delayed and cancelled a bunch of flights that night with the same bad weather excuse. What i found weird was that on the airport screen, I had noticed that Delta, United, and Southwest flights were on time. Only American flights were getting delayed and gate changed every now and then. In conclusion guys, I had to call work to tell them that I couldn't make it to work the next day, buy food, and sleep at the airport with my family. There were pregnant women, little kids, very old people, and American Airlines didn't even give food or place to sleep. I just wanted to share my experience, as I might not fly with them again."

I recently traveled with Delta to Italy. (My flight was on Friday, December 16) The flight was originally supposed to board at 7:15 and depart at 8:15. When I got to the gate the flight was delayed an hour, no big deal. I boarded the plane around 9:15ish, we taxied to the runway and were about to take off when the pilot announced that he had made a mistake and should not have left the gate because the ground/maintenance crew had not signed off on the flight log, due to a broken water valve. We returned to the gate and had to wait on the plane for four plus hours while they repaired the valve. The pilot had no idea what was going on, he informed us it would be a quick fix, then that it was worse then they originally thought, then that we were going to switch aircrafts, and then finally that they were going to remove all of the baggage, to shut off a different valve so the water could not reach the broken valve. Finally after five hours of delay we took off, and I thought ""the worst is behind me, and soon I'll be reunited with my girlfriend and all will be well"" (My girlfriend studied abroad in Florence for the semester) boy was I wrong. We were served a very dissatisfying meal of what they called ""vegetarian lasagna"", I assumed this would be lasagna with only cheese and no meat; however, it was an eggplant lasagna which gave me food poisoning. I spent my first four days in Italy stuck in the hotel room with all of the symptoms that accompany food poising. (I'll spare you the details) Anyways this really put a damper on my trip and ruined my stay in Florence. I am just becoming well enough to eat solid foods again, which really sucks as I was looking forward to enjoying a lot of Italian cuisine. My flight was overpriced due to it being so close to the holiday, $1,300 to be exact. Which for me a 21 year old, full-time college student is a good chunk of cash. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experience getting refunded from Delta or any airline for that matter, and if this would be grounds for a refund. I know to some this will not sound like a big deal, and that I should not complain but it's all relative to my circumstance, being a young, in debt, college student, who had not seen his girlfriend of three years in over four months.

I’m currently planning a trip to Vietnam with my partner (both around 30 in case that helps with suggestions) during the first two weeks of August and am hoping to get some guidance on if the itinerary makes sense and if we should be tweaking it to compress certain places to maximize time in other areas. If you have suggestions on other places we should try to fit in with the time we have then we’re also open to suggestions.

August 5th: Arrive in Ho Chi Minh around 10 am

August 5th: fly to Da Nang, stay in Hoi An for 4 nights (Visit Da Nang and Hue)

August 9th: fly to Hai Phong and head straight to Ha Long Bay, spend 1 night

August 10th: transit to Hanoi, spend 2 nights

August 12th: visit Ninh Binh, spend 2 nights in Tam Coc

August 14th: fly to Ho Chi Minh, spend 3 nights, visit Mekong Delta

August 17th: Flight to Canada around 6 pm

You should spend 2 days (actually 1 is enough) exploring Saigon, it's enough to visit all the tourist attractions in the center of Saigon and Cu Chi tunnel. Honestly speaking, I won't recommend spending much time in Saigon if you want to experience the best Vietnamese culture in a short time. Notice: MANY STUDENTS WANT YOU TO PRACTISE ENGLISH WITH THEM IF YOU ARE CAUCASIAN, this is very common, so don't worry if you're asked to talk, some students will even give you a small present to thank you for your kindness. If you are a partier, you definitely ought to stay at a hostel around Bui Vien street, it only takes about $5-8 for one night as you wanna stay in a dorm room, as there are many bars and the prices are quite cheap around that area.
Mekong Delta is a magnetic tourist attraction, I suggest visiting and stay here for 2 days. What's better than sitting on a small boat and watching the life on Mekong river? You have opportunities to go through the authentic Vietnamese culture by working with peasants as well! 
Next stop: Ba Ria-Vung Tau. Many tourists ignore this beautiful coastal province although it's really worth visiting. It's 100 km far away from Saigon. You'll pass over Ba Ria on your way to Vung Tau from Saigon. Vung Tau has gorgeous beaches, obviously, they're not as stunning as ones in Nha Trang, however, you'll love the peaceful atmosphere of the city. Most importantly, one of the biggest statues in the world is belonged to the city, it's the Jesus Christ the King statue, which is quite similar to the statue in Rio, located on the top of a mountain. Bach Dinh is another place which is worth visiting, it's a historical building, you are able see stuff used by the last king of Vietnam there. Ba Ria, in which you are able to learn how 2 traditional foods known as pho and bun (rice noodle) are made in the so-called Long Kien neighborhood, is only 25 km away from Vung Tau. Ho Tram, which is about 50km away from Ba Ria, has a very famous 5-star-hotel (and casino) whose name is The Grand Ho Tram Strip; therefore, if you want to stay at a luxury hotel, it'll be the best choice! There are a lot of other things to do here, if you need detailed information with this destination, I'm always willing to help! From Ho Tram, you can head straight to Mui Ne! In my opinion, spending 2 days in this province is enough.
Mui Ne: this is called ""Vietnamese desert"". Endless sand and great beaches! Ponashu tower, which was built in 1200 years ago, is a place you must visit. You should spend 2 days here.

It was between Thailand/Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan (I'm fairly positive the surge in travel advertisement from Japan tourism agencies I've seen had some effect on me :p).

**Question:** As an American who has only traveled to places like Australia and Western Europe I'm a little intimidated. Where should I start when searching for places and things to see in Japan? What resources are good to utilize to accomplish this?

**Time:** Later this year, probably September-November. I'd be able to spend about two weeks there (two work weeks and the weekends on each side).

**Interests:** I am a foodie/craft beer and spirits enthusiast. I love to try new things, and meet new people! I definitely want to check out Tokyo and the cities, but as I've historically only spent time in a city when traveling I want to spend at least half my time in rural areas that are less populated and maybe even enjoy some hiking. I really enjoy learning about different cultures, museums, ways of living.

Non-interests: Not huge into shopping.

**Way I like to travel:** I often enjoy minimal luggage and like to travel with a backpack, usually preferring to leave any luggage at home. At most I'll bring a collapsible backpack with inside my main for items/food I gather on the way and want to bring home. Hostels/AirBnB over hotels are fine for me, not purely for budget but I like the way many are structured.

**Budget:** I prefer to spend my money on experiences, food and events. I usually spend my accommodation in cheaper choices like hostels and AirBnb's. I always check out a locations public transit before looking into taxi's/ride sharing/private transportation. 

For my trip to Japan, I expect to get there on a free ticket with my built up Delta miles. I would be aiming for around $2,000 as a trip budget goal after accommodation, food, and entertainment/experiences.

**Concerns:** I often end up traveling solo, as an English speaking American would that make things incredibly challenging at all? I'm not afraid to do some leg work to learn certain phrases and I'm ok with being thrown out of my comfort zone. My goal is to visit somewhere for the first time that is sufficiently different than my daily life and culture.

Thanks so much for any and all thoughts you might have! :)"

169,Studying in London Short-Term - Will I need Proof of Onward Travel?,2,9z3p16,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9z3p16/studying_in_london_shortterm_will_i_need_proof_of/,15,2018-11-21 17:32:59,"TL;DR - I am studying in the UK starting January 9th, heading home on June 8th, on a US passport. I have booked a one-way ticket to London, but have not purchased a return ticket yet. I have been told that US passport holders do not need to apply for a visa before entering the UK to study (6 months or under). However, I am worried I may need to provide proof of onward travel to be allowed into the UK. Would I need this?

&#x200B;

Long story:

I am a student living in Hawaii that has been accepted into a study abroad program in London via my University's study abroad center. I have purchased a one-way ticket from HNL to LHR via StudentUniverse. I was recently cautioned by my mom's boyfriend that the UK requires proof of onward travel for people entering the country.

&#x200B;

I plan on flying on my US passport (though I do also have a Japan passport as I was born with dual citizenship, this will be relevant later). I have done a lot of googling and have found conflicting info. I have found many people stating that in all cases you should have proof of onward travel with you before traveling.

&#x200B;

However, some have stated that it is not required for students intending to studying in the UK. Some have claimed that this also applies to those with a short-term study visa, though I have seen more people claim that this is true with the Tier 4 Student Visa. Also, as I am traveling on my US passport I was told that rather than applying for a Short Term Study Visa before leaving I would not need a visa to study in the UK for up to 6 months if I can provide all required documentation upon arrival.

&#x200B;

I will be entering the UK on January 9th, and my current plans are to leave on June 8th (or sometime during the week before). My current plans are to visit my family in Japan while I apply for a postgraduate program at the university in London I would be studying at. For this purpose, I am looking at one-way tickets from London to Japan (my family lives in Hiroshima, but I am looking at flights to Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Hiroshima). As a Japan passport holder, I would not need proof of onward travel for entry into that country.

&#x200B;

Also, my current girlfriend in London is considering flying to Japan with me and staying for a short time. If that is the case, I would like to fly to Japan with her on the same flight. She does not know if she would be able to afford it at the moment.

&#x200B;

I have read on some places online that Heathrow Airport is notorious among one-way travelers and digital nomads for asking for proof of onward travel. Also, I will be flying on Delta Air Lines, and have also heard that Delta has a reputation for asking for proof of onward travel before allowing you to board their flights.

&#x200B;

So my question is, would I need proof of onward travel? If so, how can I get that (LEGALLY) without compromising the flexibility I want? What would be the cheapest and most reliable way of doing so?

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, thank you for actually bothering to read the whole thing."

However, going onto WestJet's website, I can't set the departure city to LEX in their online check-in tool. It's just not an option. Does this mean the airport doesn't support online check-in?

Worth noting the flight is `WestJet #### operated by ENDEAVOR AIR DBA DELTA CONNECTION `. I'm assuming this still means I use WestJet for the checkin, though, and not Delta, as all the connecting flights are WestJet."

I've heard you should arrive at the airport about two hours prior to your flight's departure time, is that true?

We fly in and out of Ho Chi Minh city, tickets are already purchased (depart from U.S.). 

We're both late 20s and enjoy outdoor activities such as kayaking & light hiking, seeing the big tourist/historic sites (i.e. TripAdvisor's list of thing to do), and eating. I'm more into museums than she is so we'll go to one or two. She'll probably want a day to lounge at a beach or pool (does an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay cover that?). We'll get drinks at a bar, but neither of us are big on partying/clubbing. Budget wise I'd say we're somewhere in the middle... private hostel rooms instead of shared bunks, but no hotel penthouses.

I know 2 weeks is not ideal and people will say we need 2 months for this trip, but that's not really an option since we both work. We usually do one big international trip a year, so we'd like to see both countries while we're there. Below is the itinerary I have in mind. Are we cramming too much in, missing any must sees, spending too much time in a city that doesn't offer much?

Day 1: land in HCM at 11am

Day 2: Ho Chi Minh

Day 3: Ho Chi Minh - Mekong Delta?

Day 4: fly to Hanoi around noon

Day 5: Hanoi

Day 6: Ha Long Bay, overnight cruise

Day 7: Ha Long Bay, bus back to Hanoi

Day 8: fly to Siem Reap

Day 9: Siem Reap - Angkor Wat

Day 10: Siem Reap - Angkor Wat

Day 11: Siem Reap

Day 12: bus to Phnom Penh

Day 13: Phnom Penh

Day 14: fly to HCM

178,Just got back from an amazing honeymoon in Italy and Greece! Full recap and details.,19,dcicea,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/dcicea/just_got_back_from_an_amazing_honeymoon_in_italy/,14,2019-10-03 03:15:48,"I posted this over in r/weddingplanning, but I figured you folks might appreciate it also. This was my second international trip and my husband's first. We got to do a lot in 11 days (12 days counting travel time), so I hope this recap is helpful to someone planning a similar trip! I wrote a whole lot below, so I tried to highlight the things I really liked in **bold.**

**BUDGET: \~$5,000**

We booked as much as possible in advance: flights, hotels, train tickets, tour tickets, etc. When all was said and done, we spent about $4,200 booking everything. Then all we had to pay on the actual honeymoon was minor daily expenses like food and a couple of taxi rides. All in all, I think we came in right around $5k.

**ITINERARY**

9/14: Wedding day! We live in Florida but wedding was in New York.

9/16: Overnight flight from NY to Venice, Italy

9/17: Arrive in Venice, stay 1 night

9/18: Venice to Florence, stay 2 nights

9/20: Florence to Rome, stay 2 nights

9/22: Rome to Santorini, stay 2 nights

9/24: Santorini to Mykonos, stay 2 nights

9/26: Mykonos to Athens, stay 1 night

9/27: Fly home, Athens to NY

**DAILY RECAP**

**9/17, Venice:** We took an overnight flight, so we arrived in Venice at about 11 a.m. We took a small boat from the airport to the actual city. We were able to check into our hotel and our room was ready early, which was nice, and we were staying right next to the **Rialto Bridge** which is a great area. We dropped our things off and went to walk around a bit and grab lunch. Venice is unlike any city I've ever seen. It's all narrow alleyways and water! Getting around can get kind of confusing, but it's also really fun. After lunch we went back to the hotel for a much-needed nap. That night we went for a **Gondola ride**, which is pricey but worth it for the experience. We then went to a wine bar for some amazing wine and light snacks, then grabbed pizza (also amazing) on the way back to the hotel. We passed out hard from exhaustion!

**9/18, Venice and Florence:** We got up fairly early to grab coffee and a croissant at a nearby bakery. Then we went to **Saint Mark's Basilica** and Doge's Palace. We went inside St. Mark's and it was absolutely stunning. We did not care to pay the entrance fee to Doge's, so we just looked from the outside. Then we went to the local Da Vinci Museum. It's very small, but was interesting. We had more pizza for lunch at a place called **Rossopomodoro** and it was great. Then we caught the 2pm train to Florence. The ride was about 2 hours. In Florence, we checked into our hotel (**Hotel Monna Lisa** \- highly recommend!) and relaxed a bit. That evening we went to the **Mercato Centrale** in Florence, a huge food hall with tons of amazing food and wine. We ate way too much, then checked out a couple of local bars. It was an amazing evening!

**9/19, Florence:** Morning coffee and pastry at a local bakery. Then we headed out for the day, first visiting the **Statue of David**, which was amazing to see in person. Then we walked to the **Piazzale Micelangelo**, which is about a 30 minute walk outside the city but so worth it. It's a huge plaza overlooking all of Florence, and the view is amazing! We then walked back into Florence and visited the Duomo. We hadn't bought tickets in advance, which it turns out is required to schedule a time to actually go in the dome. But we did get to climb the bell tower and had an amazing view from there. We got sandwiches for lunch from the nearby **Panini Toscani**. We were pretty exhausted from the walking and climbing, so we went back to the hotel and napped a bit. That evening, we had a glass of wine in the hotel garden, then headed out to our dinner reservations at **La Bottega Del Buon Caffe**. This was an absolute highlight of the trip! It's a Michelin-starred restaurant and it was absolutely incredible. We then went for drinks at nearby **Rasputin**, a gothic-themed ""secret bar"" which was really neat. Unfortunately, we were really tired and full of food and didn't have the energy to stay very long, but the one drink I had was good.

**9/20,** **Florence and Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then headed out to grab lunch at a small pizza shop, **Gustarium,** which was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD. Then we headed to the train station for our 1pm train to Rome. We had a hiccup here which was that we had planned to take the bus to the train station (we had taken the local bus to the restaurant the night before and it was so easy!) but at this time all of the busses were completely full. We couldn't get on a bus and were risking missing our train so we ended up walking the \~20 minutes to the station with our huge backpacks, which wasn't too fun. But we made it! It was about an hour and a half to Rome, where we took a cab to our Airbnb. We put down our stuff and then immediately headed out to grab an early ""dinner"" at **Sfiziarte** \- a casual sit-down eatery near the vatican. Food was so good! We then headed to Vatican City. Going here was a lifelong dream of mine and it did not disappoint. We saw St. Peter's Basilica, though we did not go inside. Then we headed to the **Vatican Museum** at 5pm for a **night tour** of the museum. They do these on Friday nights and it was SO worth it. Our tour guide was amazing and the museums are way less crowded at night. We saw and learned so much, with the tour ending in the **Sistine Chapel**! We then checked out a few bars in the area before heading back to the BnB.

**9/21, Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then went to lunch at **Alfredo Alla Scrofa,** which is the birthplace of fettuccine alfredo! It was great and also happened to be right by our Airbnb. Then we did a 3 hour guided tour of the colosseum and ancient Rome. The sights were amazing and we learned a lot, but 3 hours was a bit long in my opinion. We grabbed a snack at another great pizza place, **Pizza e Mozzarella**, then headed over to a different area of Rome where we planned to go to dinner at a popular restaurant called Tonnarello. Unfortunately there was a huge wait for dinner and we ended up going to another restaurant in the area, **Otello**, which also ended up being amazing! There were also a ton of small bars in this area with great specials, so we hung out there until we needed to go back and get some sleep.

**9/22, Rome and Santorini:** We headed to the airport first thing in the morning for our flights to Athens and then Santorini (there are no direct flights to the greek islands). We arrived in Santorini at around 4pm. We had been really excited to go here because we splurged on a honeymoon suite at our hotel (**Aeolos Studios**) and wow, it did not disappoint. We had a balcony with a jacuzzi overlooking the volcano. It was incredible! We had an amazing dinner at nearby restaurant **Aktaion,** then went to **MoMix**, a molecular mixology bar with fun and interesting drinks. We were tired from traveling so we didn't stay out too late.

**9/23, Santorini:** This was one of the busiest days of our trip because there was so much we wanted to do! We had lunch at a restaurant called Avocado, which was very highly reviewed but I thought was just okay (I just got a salad though so maybe that's why). Then we headed down to the Old Port of Santorini to go on a **volcano hot springs cruise**. Getting to the old port is no easy feat, as you have to climb down 587 stairs to reach it! There is also a cable car that can take you down, but the line was incredibly long so we chose the stairs. It was exhausting but a pretty cool experience. The cruise itself was amazing! We hiked the volcano (which still has an active crater, seeing the sulfer was so cool), and then got in the water at a nearby hot spring. We got back around 5:30 very tired and dirty, raced back to our hotel to change (we took the cable car back up thank goodness), and then left again for dinner. We had another incredible dinner with a view at **Argo.** After dinner we stopped at a romantic bar on the way back to our hotel, **Mylos**, for a nice drink with another great view.

**9/24, Santorini and Mykonos:** We woke up and the weather was awful! We'd had breakfast plans, but it was so foggy and rainy outside we didn't feel like leaving the hotel, so we just got room service. At noon we had to head to the port (different port from yesterday) to take our ferry over to Mykonos. We actually got very lucky because there was a ferry strike on this day and most ferries were cancelled, but for some reason ours wasn't! It was very stressful waiting to find out. We arrived in Mykonos and checked into our hotel, where we rested for a while. Then we went into the main area of Mykonos for dinner and drinks. We had heard a lot about the nightlife in Mykonos and wanted to experience it, and we certainly did! We went to a few places, but my favorites were **Alley Cafe** (which is actually just a bar) and **Skandinavian Bar**, which is a dance club. We both definitely had too much to drink and neither of us really remember getting back to the hotel, so maybe that wasn't too smart. But we had a blast dancing the night away! It was definitely the party night of the trip.

**9/25, Mykonos:** I woke up regretting my decisions the night before, as I was pretty hungover and couldn't get out of bed for several hours. We did manage to get up in the early afternoon and take a bus down to Paradise Beach, where we had lunch at a great restaurant, **Indian Palace**. We went to the beach but not for too long, then we took the bus back to Mykonos Town. I almost threw up on the bus due to being hungover so it wasn't great. We rested a bit more at the hotel, then went to **Karavaki Restaurant** for dinner. The restaurant is on top of a huge hill and has an amazing view, though it was a bit of a hike to get there! We went to bed super early due to our early flight the next morning.

**9/26, Mykonos and Athens:** We had a 6:40 a.m. flight out of Mykonos, so we were up by 4 a.m. It was tough but it ended up being worth it to have the whole day in Athens! We got into Athens by 7:30 a.m. and went to our hotel **(Palladian Home)**. They were able to have our room ready within the hour, which was great because we got to take a morning nap. Around noon we went out for a **3 hour guided tour of the Acropolis** and the related museum. I have always loved ancient Greece, so this was an incredible experience, although similar to the last tour I felt like 3 hours was a little too long and it dragged on at times. But we still loved it! I was singing Hercules songs all day, lol. That night, we decided to check out two bars that are on the World's 50 Best Bars List, **The Clumsies** and **Baba au Rum**. Both bars were incredible and it was a great end to our trip!

**9/27, Athens and New York:** We headed straight to the airport in the morning for a flight out at 9:25 a.m. The 10.5 hour flight home was pretty miserable (two hours longer than the flight on the way there), and I'm still adjusting from the jet lag, but it was so worth it!

**WHAT I LOVED**

The whole trip was easily the best trip of my life, and my husband agreed! I loved pretty much every second of it, but these are the things that really made it great:

* The itinerary - I was a bit nervous about hopping cities every 1-2 days, but it actually worked out great. We got to see a million things, but it was also never too stressful, as we found plenty of time to just relax and rest. I might make one change (noted below), but otherwise I think it was the perfect mix of relaxation and sightseeing.
* The prices, especially in Italy - we were so pleasantly surprised by how affordable everything was! You could find a big glass of wine for 3 euro pretty much anywhere in Italy, maybe 4 euro in Greece. Entrees which would cost $15-20 in America were generally under 10 euro. The islands were a bit more expensive, which makes sense. It was nice to enjoy all these restaurants and bars without feeling too guilty about our budget.
* The food! Not much to say here, just the food in both countries was absolutely incredible, so much fresher and more flavorful than what you find 90% of the time in America.
* Silly shirts - we got a bunch of those cheesy honeymoon couples shirts, regular Mr. and Mrs. ones as well as nerdy themed ones, and we had so much fun wearing them. I know it's not everyone's jam, but we figured this was the one time to ham it up. Plus, plenty of people noticed and offered us congratulations, and we got a free bottle of wine at 3 of our hotels!
* They honeymoon suite - we kept our accommodations pretty modest for most of the trip, but the honeymoon suite we splurged on in Santorini was so worth it. We relaxed in our balcony jacuzzi both nights overlooking an incredible view. Santorini itself was the most beautiful place I have ever seen and was just an overall highlight of the trip.
* Dinner at Bottega in Florence - I mentioned in the daily recap, but this was another splurge that was totally worth it. Neither of us had dined at a Michelin restaurant before and we were just completely blown away. It was the best meal of my life!

**WHAT I MIGHT DO DIFFERENTLY**

There are very few things I would change, but here are a couple of things that might have made the trip even better:

* Mykonos - If I could do it again, I'm not sure I would include the two nights in Mykonos in the itinerary. Instead, we could have stayed for an extra night in Santorini and then done two nights in Athens instead of one. It would have saved us money and time on the ferry ride to Mykonos, plus it would have given us more time in those two cities that I liked a little better. Mykonos was fun (definitely had the most straight-up fun night of the trip there), but it's not terribly different from Santorini and I'm not sure it was worth the trouble to go to two islands.
* Guided tours - We loved the night tour of the Vatican and I would definitely do that one again! As to the other two tours (colosseum and acropolis), I'm torn. We did learn a lot, but it was too much information at times and it got a little bit tedious. I would do maybe a 2 hour tour, but not a 3 hour again.
* Norwegian flight - we flew on the way there with Delta, but our flight home was through Norwegian. We got it VERY cheap and I guess you do get what you pay for. Apparently Norwegian is having huge financial issues right now, so they're leasing out their flights to another company, Hi-Fly. The plane was easily from the 1990s and had none of the features that our Delta flight had. There was a screen on the back of the seat but it only played a movie at the beginning of the flight and the audio didn't work. Then we got the audio working but it didn't play any more movies. On a 10.5 hour flight! There were no outlets or anything, and my millenial ass didn't bring a physical book to read, just a kindle which died. My headphones (wireless), also died. So there was nothing to do on this 10.5 hour flight except try to sleep, which didn't happen because it was a daytime flight and we were located next to the bathroom so I was hearing A TOILET FLUSHING EVERY 30 SECONDS. We both nearly went stir crazy by the last couple of hours. Sorry, that was a bit of a rant, and a very first world problem, but seriously - I would pay for a better flight next time.

**CONCLUSION**

I hope this was a little bit helpful for someone! I know I wrote quite a lot, but I hope I conveyed how seriously amazing every day of the trip was. We're so sad that it's over but we're already planning our next international trip! I would HIGHLY recommend this itinerary for anyone considering it for their honeymoon or just a getaway. It was truly magical."
179,Why is the Google Flights price so much cheaper than the actual booked price?,1,810zjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/810zjo/why_is_the_google_flights_price_so_much_cheaper/,14,2018-03-01 03:10:49,"Sorry if this has been asked before.

So, i just booked LAX to Inverness, which, according to Google Flights was going to be $537 or something like that with all fees and taxes included.  When I went to select the flight (2 of the same flight),  it had booking options for different booking parties ranging from  $1,054 (booking through a travel agent) to $1,628 (booking through KLM/Delta).  I tried to book through the $1,212 Air France option by phone.  When all is said and done, I paid $1,563.


So the  $537 flight ended up being $781.  What happened here??  Is there really a $537 price flight out there? Did I pick the wrong booking option? Is the cheapest price only if I book with a travel agent?


How can I avoid this sudden, very pricey markup when actually booking flights?"

I'm looking to head to East Asia on Monday, the 9th for some last minute travel, returning at the end of the month on the 28th (approximately 3 weeks). I'm looking to visit Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. I've got no real requirements other than great beaches, good/interesting things to see, and awesome food. My budget is going to be around $3K-$4K (after airfare) and can do a mix of luxury, tourist-y, and backpacker style tourism.

I have no idea where I should start or where I should end, other than knowing that I'll probably want to spend a bit of extra time in Southern Thailand relaxing on some beach somewhere.

What should I see? What should I avoid? What's the best way to get around (for those of you who have traveled to these countries). Any suggested itinerary? Preferred hotels or places you might have stayed at? Am I giving myself enough time to see all four countries?

Any help from those who have traveled here would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers!

Edit: Here's some additional info, based on the subreddit rules:

* I don't mind roughing it but prefer a little bit of comfort.
* I don't necessarily like tourist-y destinations unless there is something of historical or architectural of note (ie: if I were going to San Francisco, Fisherman's Wharf would not be cool, but the Golden Gate Bridge would be cool).
* I like warmth and water and jungle. A boat trip up one of the deltas would be cool.
* I live in a big city, don't desire to visit any on this trip. Countryside, seaside resorts or cottages, all of that is appealing.
* Beaches, beaches, water, water.
* I am a certified SCUBA diver; would love to get a few dives in although it's been quite a while since I've strapped the tanks on and would probably need a refresher course when I got there.
* I am open to any form of travel when I get there, trains and planes preferred.

Oh yes, I am woefully unprepared for this trip, but am looking to get out of my comfort zone and turn it into an adventure.

More details, and hoping for lodging and/or commuting recommendations: thinking a week down in the Gulf of Thailand on Ko Samui / Ko Pha-ngan / Ko Tao for some diving, then back to Bangkok to run into Laos for a few days (thinking Luang Prabang with optional side trip to either Vieng Veng or Si Phan Dong), then over to Vietnam if I can get my Visa in time (my thoughts here are Sapa, Hue and maybe Ho Chi Minh city; I've not heard good things about either Hanoi or Halong Bay). After that, back to Thailand and over to the Andaman Sea for a day or two in Phuket, a run up to Khao Lok for a jump to the Similan Islands, and if I have time left, Ko Phi Phi and maybe Railay (Ray Lay?) Beach for some rock climbing.

After that, a jump to San Francisco for three days of Wilco shows and then back to New York City to plan my next vacation."

My husband and I will be flying in April and have never flown with Icelandair.

I just bought the 60L Patagonia bag as a carry-on (http://www.patagonia.com/product/black-hole-duffel-bag-60-liters/49341.html). It just barely is over in length and width (or something like that) for the carry-on dimensions. I'm wondering how anal Icelandair is with their carry-on bags. I am thinking of going in and switching it for the 45L but wanted to ask those who have flown it first.

Also, when it says a personal item, that means just your basic personal item that airlines such as Delta, Alaska, etc take? I usually bring a large-ish personal item and am worried they mean  some sort of tiny 6inch by 6inch personal item bag.

I was wondering if you could help me out with your personal preference on this.  If this is the wrong place to ask, kindly let me know who I could ask for this. 

I fly to Europe (from USA) about twice a year for work. Typically I always fly Lufthansa Premium. I have had a great track record with them ( only 1 issue). I find the reclining seats great, plus the Leg rest is incredible. 

Recently I was booking my flight and I now see that Delta has a Premium + option available, that wasn't previously available.   Our budget is $3k / flight, so First Class is out of reach (without me forking money out of my pocket to get it), However Premium + is within reach (about $2,500 round trip). 

I can tell from the Delta website that it is about the same as Lufstansa. 

My variables are the following. 

• Domestically I always fly Delta. My city is a hub, so I get direct flights to where I need to go. This means I am part of the Frequent Flyer program. 

• The Delta flight looks to only be upgraded from my City to Amsterdam. From Amsterdam onward it is a 1-2 hour standard flight. This means about 4 ours total of flying with cramped legs (i am tall with bad knees).

My girlfriend and I are visiting Vietnam in august 2018 and we’re so excited. We would love some help on our itinerary - is it realistic? We are thinking around 23 days, maybe a couple more/less days. Our itinerary can be seen here: https://imgur.com/a/5y2bM

    1 day in Hanoi
    2 days in Sapa
    (1 day in Hanoi) - or straight to Halong Bay?
    3 days in Halong Bay
    3 days in Phong Nha-Ke Bang

    3 days in Hoi An
    1 day in Da Lat + Mui Ne
    2 days in HCMC
    1 day in Mekong Delta
    1 day in Hanoi

The last day we are going back to Hanoi, so we are sure we can catch the plane back to Denmark.

**A couple of questions:**

We still can’t decide between Sapa or Ha Giang. We are leaning towards Ha Giang, but it just seems easier traveling to and from Sapa. Do you have any experience with Ha Giang or any recommendations? We want to do a homestay.

Can we go straight from Sapa/Ha Giang to Halong Bay?

We are traveling from Hue → Hoi An on a motorbike - do you have a good tour reference?

We would love a tour on a motorbike from Da Lat to Mui Ne or HCMC. It would be nice if it was just a couple of days. Do you have a good tour reference?

And lastly, is there something on our itinerary you would change to something else? Something we should skip? Or is there anything we're missing?

It is important for us to travel on a budget and to see as much as possible, but not to rush through it. We hope someone can help us! Thank you :-)

Kind regards from Emil & Line"

As I mentioned, most of our locations are serviced by AA, but we are required to book travel through an agency and are basically required to pick the lowest logical fare. Sometimes that means going via Delta versus American :/ we also bill the fare directly to the company, so sadly I cannot rack up extra award mileage by charging to my personal credit card.

Now I don't know what I was thinking.

US citizen. Have flown international only once before.  Will have just a carry-on and maybe a personal item, no checked bags.   Have TSA Pre.  

Flight is in May, leaving from a small US airport heading into Minneapolis.  Once in MSP, heading to Europe.  Carrier is Delta or Delta partner(s)

I'm getting quite concerned that the layover in MSP is only 1 hr and 5 min.   That's cutting it close.  Way close.  And I'm a bit spooked by it now  (funny that it didn't bother me much when I first booked it) .  

The wife and I both opted for the Delta Comfort+ for the extra leg room.  

Looks like Delta says if we want to re-book and arrive in MSP earlier, we'd forfeit what we already put down for the Comfort+.

So, if we are already confirmed through all parts of the trip, carry-on only, ( TSA pre  but should have cleared security already so moot at that point) is that 1:05 layover enough to probably make that flight? 

ETA::  UPDATE
Found the email from Delta.  Looks to be single ticket, one confirmation etc.  Apparently I made this reservation way back in July  ( no wonder I can't remember jack-all about it).  And I dunno why, but somehow got it into my head that I had to be at the gate earlier for an international than a domestic...even though I'll be ""checking in"" online 24 hours or so in advance.

The only restriction I have is the flight back to the states is early on the 29th so I'd like to spend the night in Milan on the 28th.  I wanted to get some input from you fine folk on the below ideas:

* MILAN->FLORENCE->VENICE->MILAN: Fly into Milan on the 29th and then take an Air Italia flight directly into Florence.  This will get us to Florence and is recommended as a great city to travel in.  We would AirBNB there for three nights before taking another flight (maybe train to see the countryside?) into Venice.  We'd stay in Venice for two nights and then head back to Milan (either flight or train again).  Spend a night in Milan and then fly out the following morning.

* MILAN->ROME->FLORENCE->MILAN: Fly into Milan on the 29th and then take an Air Italia flight directly into Rome.  Spend two nights in Rome and then head up to Florence either with a train or a flight.  Is that a nice train ride?  Isn't the west coast of Italy pretty?  Spend three nights in Florence then head to Milan to be there the night before the trip.

TL;DR best way to get compensation for delayed-for-maintenance flights on 3 separate airlines.

Long Story:

Not to say that someone else hasn’t had worse luck and worse flight delays, but my most recent trip was chalk full of delays on different airlines and while I’m totally fine now that I’m home, I’m still annoyed. I’m looking for advice on the best way to get reimbursement from each airline. Currently, I am planning on just going through each airline’s customer service phone line, but if there’s any other recommendations for what I should do, I’d love to hear them.

All of this flying is in the US

Flight 1: just me affected, delta airlines, got on flight, engine wouldn’t start, deplaned after an hour, flight delayed a total of 3ish hours, normal connecting flight would have been missed so they rebooked me to a different airport where I eventually made it to my destination 5 hours after us should have, 5 hours of work missed, somewhat important meeting missed.

Flight 2: my in-laws flight was delayed/cancelled(not sure) due to maintenance, American Airlines, AA rebooked them on a later flight causing them to miss a paint and sip class that I paid for, in-laws have no interest in paying me back but (if it’s easy enough) they’ll go through the reimbursement process for the paint class and give me the reimbursement, I know it’s only $60 but I’d rather not eat that

Flight 3: return trip home for me and wife, United Airlines, flight delayed due to maintenance (incoming flight landed but there was an issue so they lazily (yes I’m most upset about this flight) went and grabbed another plane from the hangar), flight was delayed about 1hr and 15min which essentially ate up all of our layover time at the next airport and we ran about a mile (not exaggerating) through the airport and made it to our connecting flight literally as the gate agent was walking away to shut the door, the whole plane waited just for us which was really nice but if we would have been 30 seconds later the doors would have been closed. Yes we made this connecting flight but I’m pissed about me and my wife having to run through the airport to barely make the flight

So 3 different airlines, 3 different situations, what’s my best options here? Thanks in advance for the suggestions.

Side note on Flight 1: Delta overbooked the flight by 2 people and offered 2 $800 dollar Amazon gift cards for people to take a later flight, guess who wasn’t smart enough to take that offer? Me and 100 other people :("

Every SEA country is incredibly different from one another!

I'm trying to decide if I should head to Myanmar next after a truly disastrous trip to Vietnam, however. I travel solo, mainly, and am a young-middle-aged woman who has been to a few dozen countries now, on several continents.

**Some things that I love about Southeast Asia:**

So I loved -- loved, loved, loved -- Cambodia and Laos, as well as Northern Thailand. These are three very different countries, but the people were nice in all of them, and the sights were fantastic! The cities were the right size and bustling but not hectic. I loved the jungle and waterfalls, I loved the relaxed vibe, there was always something to do, I loved the monks and monasteries and wats, the infrastructure was rugged in Laos but serviceable, and while I'm not a big foodie, I really liked especially Cambodian and Thai food, and thought Laotian food was also pretty good. I'm not huge on nightlife and keep to myself, a slow traveler who loves UNESCO heritage sights and historical places, stay mid-range to upmarket although I'm also fine as long as somewhere has running water (truly, don't care if it doesn't have hot showers or any amenities) and some nice people who smile and help out a bit. I like walking around and don't mind the heat unless it's extreme.

I love meeting people on the road too, but it's not essential for me as I do fine with my own company. I do make friends easily though, particularly on short tours (I cannot imagine easily taking a longer tour of more than a night or two). I like mainly very local experiences, however: watching kids play soccer at night or women haggling at the markets or a wedding.

I do not like overdevelopment or resorts, although a good swimming pool never hurts.

**Some things that I disliked about Southeast Asia:**

Vietnam was the fourth SEA country I went to, and it was by far the most developed. I was there for three weeks, really stuck it out, this was just in May/June, and went to North, Central, South, and the Mekong Delta (I did like the Mekong Delta, a lot). The thing that I struggled with in Vietnam, aside from the heat, were that it was harder to get around, plain and simple. The traffic was abysmal almost everywhere and no tuk tuks, just motos, which scare the Hell out of me. Also, I loved the sights in Hue, but beyond that, I found most to be small or unimpressive, with Hoi An a complete tourist trap. I had a hard time finding a way to get out of what felt like an endless urban or suburban sprawl, although I liked Hanoi's Old Quarter for its beauty, it was so manically busy that I was defeated about walking around after a few days. I also did not like the food, although I knew that in advance of the trip (part of this is unquestionably because I don't eat pork or beef). Ho Chi Minh City just reminded me of a very dirty version of Los Angeles. The people were not friendly to me overall, although those who were stood out in a wonderful way, but it was impossible to get close to anyone despite my trying to make conversation and while there, even going to local bia hois and ""the non-touristic parts of town,"" I found little possibility of being accepted into local spaces. So I was hot, claustrophobic, and bored. The happiest moments for me were seeing the floating markets of Cai Rang on the Mekong Delta and touring some of the local areas there, the sights in Hue, and a tour to Halong Bay.

The vibe though, it was kind of tense. It's also a deeply secular, very capitalist-driven country, ironically, and I couldn't even find local crafts or anything because it is just much more into mass commercialization, I guess. I found it pretty modern in an odd way.

It also felt oddly formal and well, not that much fun. No sense of pleasure going on, which I found even in Laos (even if the pleasure and party were sitting around at a tiny restaurant with two people).

The touts didn't help either. After three weeks, I was exhausted by their tenacity, picking me as a solo woman, assuredly.

**So, bearing on that in mind, any thoughts about how Myanmar would stack up?**

I am obsessed with seeing Bagan, no big surprise. But I am also mainly curious to see what the culture is like? Are there areas of beautiful jungle? Any wildlife? I love to watch monkeys and birds and that kind of thing. Is the food very bland or red-meat-heavy? Is the traffic overwhelming so that it's hard to walk around? Are the people friendly enough to smile when you smile at them? Is it chill?

I have really never disliked a place, but my last trip to Vietnam gave me pause (for the first time in my travels). I considered leaving repeatedly but had a single-entry visa and a flight back out of Vietnam, so it was not possible.

I like all kinds of places in the world.

How does Myanmar ""compare"" (if one can say that countries can compare) to Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in terms of travel, especially in consideration of my likes/dislikes."

I’ll be flying Alitalia Economy to Italy (Rome) from New York (JFK) and Delta Economy on the way back, to New York (JFK) from Italy (Venice).

I’m gonna be using a Rimowa Salsa 32L as my only suitcase for the trip, as well as a smaller bag that includes small personal items (phone, cosmetics, etc.). Now I know that the 32L may be small for some, but I’m a very light packer. I’ve tested a suitcase of the same size and it’s able to fit my stuff, plus I’ll be cleaning clothes during the trip. 

Technically, the width of this suitcase is slightly over the allocation by the airline. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the strictness of Alitalia and if they’ll allow baggage slightly over the limits for carryons. Also, the people that I’m traveling with have bought the entire “block” of seats that I’ll be seated in. None of them will be using carryons, so they will be more free room for myself. 

If the bag does have to be checked, I have a few concerns. What are the chances of it being lost? Will it get really damaged? I’m okay with a few scratches because I love the “aged luggage” look, but I don’t want any major dents or scratches. Finally, is it possible to mark the luggage as fragile? I’ve heard of people doing this in the past. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, especially if you have personal experience with this airline. "

I am currently sitting on a 737 that just touched down in JFK. This flight was suppose to leave this morning at 7:50am, 6 hour flight from Seattle to New York. Delta had a ""mechanical error"", apparently they couldn't find a part to the plane, and we did not take off until 1:00pm. Given the 3 hr time change, it's now 9pm in New York. In fact, we have been touched down for the past 30 minutes but there isn't room for us to board our terminal. From here, I need to take a train from Grand Central up to Connecticut and the last train is at 10:02pm--I simply won't make it.

I have no family or friends that can pick me up. I have no other means of getting home. Who do I talk to? I need either a hotel for the night, or a rental car. Even then, I still feel like Delta should *at least* pay for my rental car home or train ticket tomorrow.

223,Am I the only one here that has never had a problem with United?,1,3k9ynx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3k9ynx/am_i_the_only_one_here_that_has_never_had_a/,12,2015-09-09 22:24:26,"Type ""United"" into the search bar and the only thing you'll find are posts complaining about bad experiences with them, one going as far as calling them ""Comcast of the Sky"". This comes as a surprise to me seeing as I fly with them several times a year and have always had pleasant experiences. (Well, not pleasant, but no worse than any other US Airline.) 

My home airport is Dayton so going pretty much anywhere requires a connection in Chicago; a major airport for all three big airlines. (United and American in particular.) The two places I go every year are Gunnison/Crested Butte (via Denver) in the winter and Los Angeles in the spring, in addition to other places I may go once every few years. Going to Colorado is always on United and is almost always a breeze. The only time I ever had a problem was when my ORD-DEN flight was delayed by mechanical trouble and I ended up missing my connecting flight. However, upon my arrival in Denver we were met at the gate by a United representative who informed us that we had already been re-booked on the next flight and presented us with a voucher for a free night at a hotel near the airport as well as a $10 meal ticket for each of us.

 Going to Los Angeles in the spring usually involves flying either AA or Delta. Delta has been fine for the most part but flying on American more often than not becomes a complete pain in the ass. I don't think I've ever been on a AA flight out of O'Hare that wasn't delayed and their customer service completely sucks too. On my most recent trip, I flew from Burbank-Phoenix-Chicago-Dayton. In Phoenix, our flight was delayed an hour and-a-half. (Through no fault of AA, apparently someone threw up on the last flight and they had to vacuum the carpets or something.)   By the time we finally boarded, it became clear we were going to miss our flight to Dayton and would have to spend the night in Chicago. Upon landing, I expected a similar procedure as with United in Denver but coming out of the jet-bridge there was no one to be seen. Not even at the gate desk. We had to find our way to a re-booking kiosk and the seemingly thoroughly uninterested rep. on the other side took 30 minutes to get us onto the flight the next day and was ready to hang up before I asked about overnight accommodations. She curtly informed us that she couldn't do anything and we would have to go find a Customer Service staff member inside the airport. It was late at night, so there was no one at the dedicated customer service and most of the gates were empty too. We finally found two gate agents who were stuck there because the flight that was coming into their gate was delayed. (surprise!) We marched up and pretty much demanded that we be put up in a hotel and the agent, who to her credit was very polite and professional, said that she would need to phone her supervisor to approve. He pretty much just said ""yeah whatever, just give it to them"" and we were finally on our way to the hotel. (Whose bus took 45 minutes to pick us up.) 

During the ride, I thought back to people we had met at the re-booking kiosk who had also missed their Dayton flight. They struck me as the type that rarely flew and looked very unsure as to their best course of action. They were at the kiosk when we got there and were still trying to negotiate with the rep. on the phone when we left. I hoped that they too had managed to get into a hotel but thought it was more likely that AA just let them spend the night in the airport.

TL;DR I've never had a bad experience with United, and if you're ever departing from/transferring through O'Hare don't choose American Airlines."

She kept on saying she didn't see 31F in her seat map, and said ""if you can see it, why not go ahead to select it”. I explained to her it doesn't allow me to change. Then she said ""it's because it's not within 24 hours yet"". Then I ask why I am not allowed to select seat on the departure flight (within 24 hours). she then said let me talk to my supervisor. about 20 more minute wait, the phone was disconnected, not sure if it's technical difficult.

229,Stuck in Cambodia with rain... any ideas.,2,3al1d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3al1d7/stuck_in_cambodia_with_rain_any_ideas/,12,2015-06-21 10:13:17,"So, I arrived in Kampot in Cambodia coming from the Mekong Delta. We (GF and me) have had now 5 consecutive days of rain. Nothing we can really do. We still have 37 days of travel before we head home from Bangkok to Europe. But now I am wondering if there is another place we could go. I guess Philippines or Malaysia or Indonesia is full of rain these time of year too. Monsoon should have set in in India as well. Some place not too far to fly to which is feasible with a backpacking budget?

Any suggestions?"
230,"5.5 hour layover in Amsterdam, time for exploration?",4,16e9yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16e9yu/55_hour_layover_in_amsterdam_time_for_exploration/,12,2013-01-11 23:03:54,"Hello r/travel!

It is my first time here and I am inquiring if my 5.5 hour layover in Amsterdam (AMS) airport give me enough time for a quick venture into the city.

My flight is from Moscow and lands at 7:20 am local time, and my next flight leaves at 12:45 pm local time and goes to Washington. The flight is run by KLM through Delta.

I will have a bagged checked that will go through, but will have carry-ons with me.

I was just wondering if it was feasible for me to make it to see anything in the city at all. I am American and will be returning from Russia, nothing in my carry-ons will need to go through customs as far as I believe. So I assume I would be simply passing through security.

I know I needed to get a Passport Visa to study in Russia but as far as I can tell nothing is required for an excursion from the airport.

If I need to provide more information PLEASE let me know. I am clearly no whiz on international travel.

Are there tricks for keeping costs down?"
232,Skipping connecting flights when flying internationally?,0,7z0dj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7z0dj0/skipping_connecting_flights_when_flying/,12,2018-02-21 01:49:17,"I have a question about skipping connecting flights. I am a not U.S. citizen, and am planning a trip from Minneapolis to Montreal, Canada. So I am thinking to buy a one-way ticket from Air Canada, MSP-Torroto-Montreal-Halifax, and another one-way ticket from Delta, Montreal-Minneapolis-St.Louis. Of course, I will skip the connecting flights once I arrive Montreal when I get there and the connecting flights after I arrive MSP when I am back. This is much cheaper than buy a round-way tickets between MSP-Montreal. Just want to ask if this would cause me any trouble during this international trip? Thanks!"
233,Should I take an airline job that offers free travel or a serving job that will help pay for my future student loan debt?,1,3jd324,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3jd324/should_i_take_an_airline_job_that_offers_free/,12,2015-09-02 18:44:25,"I am going into my Junior year of college as a transfer student with no debt as of now. My tuition for school is $6,000/year for the next two years.

I was offered a job at The Outback to start working as a waiter. With tips it would be around $19/hr.

Delta offered me a job as a Ready Reserve Baggage Agent, no benefits except for free travel domestic and very cheap international.

I have a huge urge to keep traveling, since I just got back from a five month trip to South East Asia,  but I'm not sure if I should keep traveling or pick the job that will help me pay off my student loan debt."
234,What is your choice of a airline? (USA to Japan),2,3c59bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3c59bj/what_is_your_choice_of_a_airline_usa_to_japan/,12,2015-07-05 02:39:00,"I'm planning to go to Japan this winter, searching around Kayak and all. I do not consider taking luxury seat because I don't get on plane that often... oh why am I lying, I'm poor that's all. 
Desipite, I do consider safety and simple seating comfort. I was on delta for long time simply because that's the only plane that I have ever taken, but I thought I could try something else.

I'm seeing budget plane to be United Airline, Air Canada, and sometime Delta. If none of them are the option I'll take JAL, even though it's usually more costly. 

I don't care much about food, just seating and safety. The entertainment can come later too, I'll just sleep over it. Could anyone give me some opinion? Should I just stick to Delta?

I live somewhere in Northeast of the USA."

236,Flights were canceled and not rebooked by the airline. What do I do?,1,64jd2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/64jd2g/flights_were_canceled_and_not_rebooked_by_the/,10,2017-04-10 16:48:11,"My girlfriend and I were two of the 3,000 passengers who had their flights canceled by Delta on Thursday. Our flights were canceled due to weather, which is understandable and out of anyone's control. The problem lies with the aftermath. The gate attendant didn't alert anyone of the cancellation, the boards were not updated, and we didn't receive any updates via text or email in a timely fashion. We received alerts to our phones that the flight was delayed, and at that point the flight was actually already canceled. So we waited in line to try to get rebooked for nearly an hour. When we made it to the desk we told the attendant where our final destination was, and told her that we didn't mind connecting through a different city if that was an option. She totally dismissed this idea and remained focused on getting us to our original connector (which we were already going to miss), saying that we needed to take ""baby steps"" to figure it all out. Her solution was to place us on standby on a flight to our original connecting city, and then placed us on standby on a flight from there to our final destination. We asked her what the odds of getting on either of the flights were, and she said ""probably zero percent"". So we missed the flight out. We were never offered a hotel voucher (we were not flying out of our home city), nor were we offered new flights for the next day. They basically just told us they couldn't get us to where we needed to go.   No vouchers, no refunds, no rental car, no seats from another airline. We ended up eating a $232 car rental and driving 9 hours to our destination. What is my best course of action here?

EDIT: added the airline (Delta)"
