0,Please help finding a Delta in-flight movie!,1,5i5e3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/airtravel/comments/5i5e3b/please_help_finding_a_delta_inflight_movie/,2,2016-12-13 21:55:58,"I traveled on a Delta flight from St. Louis to Portland, Maine, back in July 2016, and I am desperately trying to find a movie that was offered on the in-flight movies list at that time. Does anyone know of a resource that might list the movies offered by Delta in previous months? Thanks in advance!"
1,Which Airline Should I Use?,1,56ty9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/airtravel/comments/56ty9g/which_airline_should_i_use/,0,2016-10-10 23:45:06,"I've been using AA but for no particular reason. I want to know which airline I should start regularly using. I know this depends on some personal characteristics, so here they are: I prefer flying first class but I do not fly a large amount every year. I'd say I fly about .75 to 1.15 round trips per month. so (and I may be wrong) I doubt that FF benefits would be a major concern for me. Basically, I want the best first-class experience for the best price. I have been doing AA paid upgrades but am worried that the airline seems to be at the bottom of most rankings for a lot of things, including service. And, I am wondering if buying Delta first-class fares wouldn't actually be less expensive anyway.

Basically, I don't have enough experience on this but I do want objectively to pick the best airline for me and be loyal to it. Oh, another thing: customer service is very important to me. So, I'm wondering if the FFs can give me the ins and outs."
