There‚Äôs honestly nothing good I can say about this airport, and now that Delta has expanded flights here, it‚Äôs gotten even worse. The bag drop lines are insane, this is the only airport where I can honestly say I find staff to be in general just straight up rude, the ones who aren‚Äôt blatantly rude, seem visibly stressed to their limit.   Even beyond Delta, the gate areas are crowded, with not even remotely enough seating, food choices are terrible, you‚Äôve got a Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, a Starbucks that can‚Äôt get an order right to save their life, A Friendly‚Äôs that always runs out of food, The only remaining choices are a few angrily staffed quick service places with limited menus. Now that Delta has control of terminal A, and will begin taking over all gates, I can only hope that they push for some drastic improvements to the terminal.  

My favorite airport is MSP. Albeit in the F gates it can get crowded, at least you can get from terminal to terminal without leaving security, there‚Äôs plenty of food choices both sit down and fast food. There‚Äôs plenty of shops to kill time in, and in the shitty event you have to sleep there, there‚Äôs plenty of quiet open space around the C/G bridge or in the A corridors, if you end up doing an overnighter on the floor. The counter and bag lines usually move at a somewhat reasonable pace. The Sky Club is always clean and well stocked. The staff at MSP just seems to give a shit. 

Honorable/dishonorable mentions: 

ATL- the mothership, plenty of food/space/flights, but can be overwhelming. 

MCO - Old and outdated, frustrating TSA. 

LAS - Spacious, clean, good food, and hey, it‚Äôs Vegas. (Occasionally long TSA) 

SEA - TSA is a total clusterfuck. Food choices are mediocre in delta area. 

What do ya‚Äôll think??"

As for gin, which is my drink, the airline only serve Bombay Sapphire (not my favorite). Should I just stuff a bag with Bombay, or it is okay for me to bring nips of Gordon's, which is cheaper and is also my favorite?

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

It's been years for me since I've last been on a plane.  But, I purchased the Comfort\+ tickets for us both \(next to each other, one at the window\).  So, a few questions I have:

1\) I'm heavy \(teetering around 350 lbs & \~5' 9""\), is this going to pose a problem with the seating?  I've read mixed things w/ big people, some have good experiences and others a little bit of trouble \(but mostly they just asked for a seatbelt extender\).  For reference, wife and I are both on the heavy side but we are actively trying to lose the weight.

2\) We don't want to check in any baggage, so we're packing light.  Just 1 or 2 suitcases for us to have our clothes and bring back some goodies, and a backpack or 2 \(mine w/ a laptop and hers mostly with books\).  Will we still have to do any baggage checking?  I read on Delta's site that you can have 1 personal item and 1 carry on, but I'm being overly paranoid here.

3\) How often are Delta's flights delayed?  So, we're leaving out of DAY and arriving in ATL to get to NRT.  We are then leaving Japan from HND to MSP to DAY.  I've looked at the overall map of DAY and ATL, some of MSP to get a feel for what we are supposed to do.  But even with the 2.5\-3.5 hour lay\-overs, not sure what to expect.

I called and asked if there was anything they could to do help me close the gap between segments/MQMs and ticket spend and got a ""no"". Which was the answer I expected, but couldn't hurt to ask, right?

Anyone here have any ideas? 

Sucks because I love flying Delta, have spent a pile of money on tickets this year, but I'm not being rewarded as much as folks who have spent about the same on tickets but were on longer distance flights. I feel like I'm pretty profitable flyer for Delta, more so than others so I believe I'm getting the short end of the stick.

* **New service begins in November for flights 6.5 hours or longer**
* **Elements include signature cocktail, tray table place mat**

&#x200B;

As airlines boost profits by packing more passengers into smaller spaces, lengthy international trips have become increasingly cramped and miserable. Delta Air Lines Inc. hopes a refreshing drink and a nicer dinner setting will help make up for all that.

Starting Nov. 5 in the coach class cabin of international trips of more than 6.5 hours, the Atlanta-based carrier will start off each flight offering coach passengers a free peach and sparkling wine cocktail or bottled water, a hot towel for freshening up and an updated menu for on-board meals. Food will be served on a small platter instead of a traditional tray, with a place mat. Dessert and coffee will be served separately ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre providing choices with elements of service to distract people from feeling like they‚Äôre stuck in a metal tube for 10 hours,‚Äù said Jaime Jewell, director for inflight brand strategy and customer experience. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really about trying to take the airplane out of the experience a little bit.‚Äù

Flight attendants, some of whom helped design the new service, will be chattier and engage more with passengers, she said. The service was tested on more than 700 Delta flights between Portland and Tokyo over the past year.

Delta declined to say how much it spent developing the new service."

Because I fly where I fly, I take Southwest most times, but last week, I looked at taking Delta for the first time in a while.  I've boycotted Delta for many years.  I had a flight cancelled due to weather on another airline, but Delta picked up my reservation to honor it...without telling me that I was wait-listed for their connecting flight.  I only found that out after I got there.  My travel agent was beside herself, trying to figure out why they would do that.

I had to fly yesterday.  It was a toss-up between Southwest and Delta, since they had about the same fare.  Using my rule, I picked Southwest.  Expecting there might be a problem, I double checked very late Friday night, and there were still seats available on the Delta flight, at $397, which is the price I would expect to pay with less than 24 hour notice.

My Southwest flight got cancelled, and in fact everything that connected through the northeast was cancelled.  But since Delta was connecting through Charlotte, they still had seats...but...

The price at 11PM at night was $397.  By 10AM that morning, as every other airline was cancelling their flights, the exact same Delta flight was going for $1059.  That was an economy class seat.  First class was available and was even more.  I've flown to London for less money.  This is simple price gouging."

However, due to some other issue, Delta had to delay flight DL 133 for 2+ hours, moving the scheduled departure time to 11:40am GMT+2 and the arrival time to 1:57pm GMT-4, which would cause me to miss my connection entirely.

Delta immediately rebooked me for a different flight, DL 257, departing at 2:40pm GMT+2 and arriving in Boston at 4:49pm GMT-4, and leaving Boston at 7:52pm GMT-4 and arriving in Indianapolis at 10:30pm GMT-4.

The perks that I'm most interested in is the seat upgrades. I'm most likely going to be either silver or gold depending on my holiday flights.

I'm wondering how often to silver/gold members get cleared for seat upgrades. I typically never fly coach or economy, so it seems that this is a great way to save on money for better seats. I suppose I'm just a bit unclear on how likely one receives these upgrades. 

I typically fly out from SEA for context as well."

I had scheduled BHM>ATL>MSP>YYC 

I had a 3 hour layover in ATL (great hit the sky club and relax) then a 3 hour layover in MSP (hit the club again) 

I understand that weather happens and can‚Äôt be controlled, but we sat on the tarmac for a few hours in BHM...we landed in ATL and I ran from D to A and got to the gate desk with 12 minutes left before departure. Only to be told that my seat had been given away and boarding was finished. 

Ok fine..I call the platinum hotline and they put me on the next flight (1 hour from that point) I go from A back to D....the flight gets delayed an hour and we are told that if we have less than a 40 minute layover we won‚Äôt make our connection in MSP. 

I speak with the gate agent who puts me on a WestJet flight that is direct to YYC. (Still don‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt booked on this flight originally as I select fastest route) 

I walk to B...get a boarding pass with WestJet....I am taken off the plane because someone else has that seat and WestJet needs to sort it out (no big deal) 

WestJet was actually amazing the entire trip. 

So I get to Calgary at 1930 local time and my luggage is still in Atlanta. I speak with the WestJet baggage agent (because there was no Delta Agent on duty) the baggage agent gives me the forms and walks me through everything. Tells me that my baggage will arrive in Calgary on 4/15/19 at 13:30.

That‚Äôs great except I fly out on Air Canada at 12:30...

Now I am in Whitehorse Yukon and have to find a suit by tomorrow at 10am for a meeting. 

Delta has not replied to luggage inquiries while WestJet has been more than helpful with everything. 


After my last 6 trips with Delta...I am seriously looking at other carriers to meet my needs."

I am a 15 year old addicted to aviation and have my mind set on becoming a pilot for Delta Air Lines and hopefully later on in my career an executive. I have started flight lessons and spend all my my time researching flight, aviation as well as the industry, I truly have fell in love with it all, especially Delta Air Lines. The history and culture at the company is something I truly admire and look up to. I aspire to be part of such a professional, historic yet innovative family. 

I live in Maryland and often fly from a WAS airport to either MSP or BJI due to family. I have always wanted to see the fortress, Atlanta and finally have gotten the chance. I received a scholorship from Delta to attend the National Flight Academy in Pensacola, I'm connecting through Atlanta there (FROM IAD) and back (TO MSP). Both layovers are around 2 and a half hours. I definitely want to walk around the airport, see the concourses, as well as the plane train. I don't quite feel comfortable leaving the airport because of my age (I am flying alone, not UM) combined with the short connection time. Unfortunately that rules out the Delta Flight Museum and seeing the HQ/TechOps. 

Can anybody recommend any restaurants to eat at or specific things to see around the concourses? Is there any way for me to get tours of the ramp or the Delta Ramp Control Towers above the concourses? Is there anybody at Delta who's brain I could pick? During my 12h layover in Minneapolis I talked to many DL pilots and found that was enjoyable/insightful as well. 

Thanks for the responses, can't wait to visit such a historical spot for a company I am in love with!!"

62,Flew First Class for the First Time Today,44,d1lvb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/d1lvb8/flew_first_class_for_the_first_time_today/,29,2019-09-09 08:11:04,"I started a new job in February where I have to fly from my home airport of GSP to BOS and back once a month, which through Delta usually necessitates a connection in ATL. Before February, I've only flown a handful of times over the years. 

My company's reimbursement policy is for ""the most economical fare class available"" and anything above that comes out of my pocket, but they do reimburse for checked bags. I started out flying Basic Economy, but after a couple of months figured out that Main Cabin was also reimbursed with no issues. 

Last month, the hotel that is recommended by my company was booked up and I found a bundle deal on Expedia for a slightly-less-fancy hotel and Comfort+ that was cheaper than just the normal rate for the recommended hotel. I did the same thing this month, but the bundle included a First Class ticket from GSP-BOS and Comfort+ on the return trip on Friday. Plus, since it was a bundle, I paid for the hotel + airfare weeks ago and have already been reimbursed by my company so there were no issues with my bundle deal making it past the bean counters.

I think I'm ruined for Main Cabin and Comfort+ now. I'm a bigger guy, and having the extra space in First Class where I never touched the person sitting next to me was by-far the best perk. Here's how I rate the rest of the experience. 

Great perks for First Class: 

* All the space. Since only two seats go into a section the width of three seats in C+ and Main Cabin, the seats are wider, there's almost a foot of armrest ""neutral ground"" between the two seats, and there was plenty of legroom. I actively avoid putting my backpack under the seat when possible because it always takes legroom away, but I don't think I would have even noticed it today. The seats also recline further, but I usually don't recline my seat so I didn't test this out.

* Free priority checked bags - I normally just bring a carry-on to avoid extra fees that I sometimes gate check, but this time I checked my carry-on and with the little yellow ""Priority"" tag on bag it was one of the first off the plane. Once I deplaned, went to the bathroom, and made it to the baggage pickup area, my bag was waiting on me. A great experience.

* Drink Service before take-off - It's awesome to get a drink before you take off. Normally, I'm used to grabbing a coffee or soda to bring onto the plane on main cabin, because it can take a while to take off and get to cruising speed, plus another 20+ min for the cart to get to my location, but in First you don't have to think about it. Just show up, board, and get whatever you want within 5-10 min. Awesome. 

* Multiple free drinks - I get a single free drink in C+, but it was nice on my flight from ATL-BOS to get a coffee w/ Baileys, a Bloody Mary, and a Bourbon and Coke Zero. 

* Drink service in first even when the rest of the plane doesn't get a drink service. The short 30-min hop from GSP to ATL never gets a drink service, but I had two coffees with Baileys in first, one pre-flight and another in the air. Awesome. 

* Free meal - I received an email a few days ago asking about my meal preference, and I chose a chicken sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. It came with a fruit plate and Chobani blueberry yogurt. It's no different than any other meal I could have gotten in the airport for $12, but I didn't have to worry about finding a meal before boarding. It was nice to just walk around during my layover without getting into long lines for food while trying to make a connection. 

* Pillow and blanket - first class domestic passengers get a little pillow and a blanket. The pillow made the already-comfortable seat even better. I didn't use the blanket, but it seemed decent. Another advantage of first class - you don't have to plan ahead to bring these things‚Äîjust show up. 

* Flight Attendant attention - the flight attendant for First Class routinely checked to see if any of us needed anything. It felt like being at a nice restaurant rather than having your meal dropped off at a QSR. The attendant on both flights was also much more personable than in my previous non-FC flights.

* 150% mileage - a great bonus. I'm going to hit silver by EOY (I flew a few times on AA and United to figure out which airline to commit to), but this will help out greatly next year when I chase gold. 

Not awesome, but still nice: 

* When my boarding pass was scanned, the flight attended took the time to look at me, saying ""Enjoy your flight, Mr. <Amator>. I've never had that happen before on a flight. 

* Small water bottles waiting on the seat tray. Nice to have early in the morning when I was a bit thirsty and could have an immediate drink. 

* The armrest with built-in cup tray. It was nice to have a place for the drinks to sit without having to extend the table. 

* The table was a fold-out from the armrest and not the standard seat-back tray table. This way, I didn't have to worry about someone leaning back in their seat and spilling my drink. 

* Little niceties like ceramic cups for coffee, cloth napkins, hot towel, and a little tablecloth for the fold out table. 

* Extra pockets in the seat back - gave me a place to park my Kindle and phone while I watched IFE on these flights.

* First class lavatory - I didn't use this on either flight, but first class gets its own lav so you don't have to wait and I've heard the amenities are a bit nicer.

All in all, I feel like FC has ruined me for other seating classes. I'm going to try and book a similar package with FC flights on both legs of the trip in the future. All of the other little perks are really nice, but having the extra space is definitely the best reason for me to fly FC."

But as a Silver Medallion member, I‚Äôd like to give it a little love. 

I made Silver Medallion late in 2017, but received five segments with Comfort+ Upgrades that year. 

I went into 2018 with Silver and have so far received another five segments. In addition, I received a couple of gate-side upgrades and one First Class upgrade (I had a late flight out of Philly and the storm made most higher medallion members jump onto earlier flights). 

On the whole? Five upgrades a year is pretty fantastic. I would say that‚Äôs about 1/3 of my total flights. I upgraded another third of them myself. And probably got stuck in the regular section for another third. But at least, those flights were still in preferred (aisle) seats. 

Finally, you still get access to the Sky Priority/Medallion check-in line at the airport. Last Friday, flying out of Atlanta before the Christmas holiday, that was a lifesaver. 

I live and fly out of Atlanta primarily, so your mileage may vary. I don‚Äôt fly enough to earn Silver on my own. I use the Platinum Skymiles Amex to hit the spend requirements and get the MQM bonuses. But all in all, I‚Äôm pretty happy with Silver Medallion status. 

tldr; Silver is a decent value for what it is. 1) Get 1/3 of your flights upgraded. 2) Preferred seats on any flight. 3) Priority check-in line. "
87,How did you obtain your first status with Delta?,4,alie76,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/alie76/how_did_you_obtain_your_first_status_with_delta/,25,2019-01-31 01:30:25,"Ciao Delta Fans! 

This year, I‚Äôm hoping to reach silver medallion status with Delta. I‚Äôm typically not loyal to specific airlines, but Delta has won my heart here in NYC. I have tons of traveling coming up with them throughout this year, and am assuming I‚Äôll definitely earn some sort of medallion status. 

I am quite young, and am learning the ins and outs of Delta Elite Status, as well as the pros and cons of owning a Delta SkyMiles CC. 

So, tell me, how did any of you reach your first silver status with Delta just from flying? Credit card usage does not count. 

Hopefully my question is clear enough. It‚Äôll be interested to hear different experiences / journeys from loyal Delta travelers. 

Cheers! "

My new wife and I were excited to be flying Delta Premium Select for our Honeymoon in October.  We researched all the airlines for flying into JHB and decided Delta Premium Select was our best option for comfort on a 15 hour flight.  Yesterday, Delta calls us and tells us the plane that was supposed to be taking us will no longer be ready and Delta Premium Select is not available on the replacement flight.  Delta comps us with some vouchers and miles refund, but they have moved us into the main cabin, and sat us apart from one another and the site won't let me change the seats.  I am sure we will be able to sit with one another, but this doesn't solve the main issue.  The seats.  We chose to go with Delta because of the pitch Premium Select offers.  My wife recently had back surgery and the doctor recommended the best chance for her to be without pain would be in a seat with more pitch.  

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to proceed?  Should I see if I can cancel and go with another airline?  Is there any way she could be upgraded to Delta One for this?  I would love to sit with her, but I know how difficult it would be for both of us to get into Delta One."

If I'm just working domestic, I'm only a silver status by the end of the year typically, but will not make silver this year. The baggage fees bumping up to $30 a bag, travel with 1 checked bag always, has made me wanting to get the platinum or reserve card. I make $125k a year currently, with >825 credit score. Probably do around $15k-$20k a year of spending on my CC, always paying off at the end of the month. My question is would I see the benefits of going up to the Reserve?

&#x200B;

The way I figure is if I don't get the card, I'll be spending $360 in 2019 in just baggage fees alone. Lounge access would be nice, but not necessary. Sometimes I do have to be at the airport for 5-6 hours before my flight, just the way my transportation works with my company. Do I get the Platinum, Reserve, or something different all together?"

150,Question about flying with an Autistic child,14,dgmczv,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dgmczv/question_about_flying_with_an_autistic_child/,21,2019-10-12 02:30:12,"So we're thinking of visiting Chicago in April and it would be my son's first flight. He'll be almost 6 at the time but he's Autistic. He loves car rides so as long as there's movement he's good. We'd also bring his tablet and lots of snacks. The flight is relatively short as well.

Here's my issue:
JetBlue is usually the preferred airline option for most families with Autism. In our situation I weighed the costs vs pros/cons. My husband and I are both big - he's over 6 feet but we're also heavier. If we did JetBlue we'd have to get very specific flights so the plane was 3x2 or 3x3 so we'd be together, and Economy seats are pretty tight. 

The other option is Delta.

Delta has a Canadair Regional Jet 900 that they use for NYC to Chicago flights. In First Class that's 1x2 seats. 

Taking cost into account I realized the difference between Economy JetBlue and First Class Delta was only $150 difference! Delta would mean significantly more room, less people to possibly disturb, and a flight attendant much closer if we needed anything. I'd also inform the airline ahead of time that he has Autism.

My question is this: has anyone taken a First Class flight with a child? I know I'm paying for a service but I don't want to get nasty looks from other passengers, as that's a real issue when we're out in public. He's pretty well behaved in that it's not like we let him run around screaming and hitting people, but he could potentially get scared during takeoff and landing and he could stim at times.

Is it generally frowned upon to seat a child in First Class? 

Has anyone flown with an Autistic child on Delta? If so, how was your experience, especially if you've also flown JetBlue."

I am a firm believer in the importance of surveys and ensuring that companies get relevant feedback (good or bad).  



Throughout the year, I have received a survey for every flight and multiple SPAM messages reminding me to fill out my surveys.  Up until recently, I have not had a single issue with Delta and received a survey after every flight.  I expressed my gratitude and happiness with their service in each survey.



No exaggeration, my last four trips have been trips from hell all related to problems caused by Delta.  I have not received a single survey related to any of those trips.  I find it hard to believe that I was randomly given a survey after nearly 20 consecutive on time trips and have not received a single survey for the past four bad trips.  If we all received random surveys after every flight, the odds of receiving 20 straight surveys followed by 4 survey exceptions is basically impossible.



If I had to guess, Delta's system does not send out surveys to passengers on flights that may have experienced delays, overbookings or lost luggage.



It is my opinion that Delta is artificially inflating their survey responses and probably reports sent to the FAA.  This should be investigated."

When I had purchased the tickets last year, only a few of the seats on the plane had been reserved, and I took the opportunity to upgrade to Comfort+, AND selected seats facing the forward closet, so there are no passengers in front of us. 

I *rarely* fly, maybe once every four years, and I've *always* been coach/near the crapper, so you can imagine that getting a seat near the front and pretending that I'm almost first class is kind of a treat.

So I'm just wondering what the chances are of having to change seats for another passenger or being forced from the flight entirely. I was always under the impression that usually people in coach are the first to relocate, but now I'm not so sure.

For those who fly often, I can imagine that this is a petty thing to be concerned about, but for me, the seats were a treat that I was happy to obtain.

British Airways refuses to help out in any way or even put me in a hotel, because apparently this was my last destination and my connecting flight is Delta, not BA, so they‚Äôre not responsible for incurred expenses. 

If I find a Delta help desk, will they be able to help me and rebook me? Does anyone have any advice at all in this regard?

That being said - If anyone has experience with BA and requesting compensation due to delays in this sort of situation, do let me know, I would appreciate it. Most people inside the airport not working for BA told me I should be compensated because the flight was delayed for a) 4 and a 1/2 hours, b) due to engine issues (not weather related, etc, which changes likelihood of being compensated) and c) directly caused me to incur expenses due to said delay."

Just goes to show if you pick your routes right or your travels wind up on the right days you can have some great luck with upgrades. 

I‚Äôve flown 11 segments this year so far and have been upgraded to Comfort+ 6 times, First Class 4 times, and Delta One 1 time.

We were not offered food, a hotel, or even our bags that were stored on the airline so we had to sleep on the floor in our clothes from the day before. To make matters worse, the airline employee working the front desk, stressed as she understandably was, slipped up and mentioned she overheard the pilot banged in sick after a night of partying and was too drunk to pilot the flight. This horrified and infuriated my wife and I. I complained using the Delta website but nobody ever responded to me so after a month went by I called customer service. The Supervisor on the phone was incredibly rude and said she could send me a gift card for $25 each. Completely insulted, she offered to up it to $100. So $200 for a fun night sleeping on an airport floor for 8 hours and taking unpaid sick time the following Monday because of Delta‚Äôs pilot issues. Has anyone ever experienced this with Delta? I thought at the very least they would give us an airline credit for a flight of equal value to the horrible flight we experienced."

‚ÄúWith the kick-off of the 2019 Medallion Year, we‚Äôve made some exciting changes to welcome kits:

Based on Member feedback about materials, Diamond Medallion bag tags will be made of a premium metal and luggage connector loops will be made out of a more durable rubber.
Members who reach Million Miler Status will now receive additional premium bag tags featuring your highest-achieved Million Miler level. With this change, Million Miler Status will no longer be included on Medallion bag tags.
We‚Äôve gone digital! With your membership card at your fingertips 24/7 in the Fly Delta app, Diamond and Platinum welcome kits will no longer include a physical membership card. In addition to the Fly Delta app, you can also print a card from My Wallet at delta.com anytime.
And coming soon:

Members who reach Gold or Silver Medallion Status for the 2020 Medallion Year (earned between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019) will receive bag tags so you can show off your Medallion Status with pride.
When you re-qualify for your Medallion Tier, or reach a higher Tier, you can expect to receive a welcome kit in the mail within a few weeks, so make sure your delivery address is up to date now. To make changes to your mailing address, visit My Profile.

These bag tags help celebrate just how far you‚Äôve come. We‚Äôll keep doing everything possible so that you experience the Medallion difference every time you travel.‚Äù

Highlights:
	- Bag tags for FO, GM, PM, and DM
	- Metal tags for DM return
	- Special MM tags

As someone who has never passed GM, pretty excited!

Basically, I rarely get upgraded and am trying to figure out if we are actually in the top upgrade positions for the whole flight (and therefore likely to get upgraded), or just temporarily up there because the majority of passengers haven't checked in yet.

241,"New delta ""pay to choose seat"" pricing model",2,6uabg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/6uabg7/new_delta_pay_to_choose_seat_pricing_model/,19,2017-08-17 18:28:51,"Just got bumped from my window to a middle seat... By a father who wanted to be with his 2 small children. 

I would blame the father for his poor planning, but this time I'm blaming Delta Airlines. The reason this guy didn't have seats together for his family is because of the new Delta pricing policy (scheme), which requires you to spend additional money in order to have choice of seats. What would you do if you were traveling with small children? Families on budgets will invariably choose the cheapest option. This one's on you, Delta... 

I will always choose an airline with an honest pricing model over one that pulls back services on order to charge more for those services."

So I‚Äôll be going to Paris, my wife booked Delta Air Lines from Chicago-Midway to Detroit to LaGuardia. Then we fly out of JFK to Paris-CDG. I told my wife that she should‚Äôve just booked ORD to JFK to CDG, but she insists that she got a better deal doing MDW to DTW to LGA.

Will I have enough time to get from LGA to JFK?"
