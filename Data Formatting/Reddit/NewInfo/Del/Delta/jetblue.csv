0,JetBlue legroom question,4,aclg3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/aclg3z/jetblue_legroom_question/,12,2019-01-04 22:10:00,How is the leg room on the JetBlue A321 flights? I am making a cross country flight (west coast to east) and usually have flown Delta Comfort+ but I'm wondering how JetBlue's legroom would compare. Would I be correct in assuming I should be looking for Even More Space seating?
1,Questions about Internet and device charging on JFK-LAX flight,2,7kiwth,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/7kiwth/questions_about_internet_and_device_charging_on/,2,2017-12-18 07:23:34,"I recently flew cross country on Delta and on United. Delta had an App I had to download that gave me access to limited content. To get the Internet, I would have had to pay $40. I chose not to. Delta provided zero ways for me to keep my phone charged. United was the same story, but at least they had USB ports.

What should I expect from JetBlue in this regard? I just want access to the Internet and a way to charge my phone."
2,Mosaic Membership Card for Status Matches,3,dhs16r,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/dhs16r/mosaic_membership_card_for_status_matches/,1,2019-10-14 19:20:22,"Got Mosaic Status, but never received a physical letter with the benefits. Some people claimed they did. I'm trying to obtain status match for Delta and they need a copy of a physical or digital membership card that confirms I have status. Has anyone done this? What did you provide for the membership card?"
3,Internship,4,d0qjtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/d0qjtn/internship/,1,2019-09-07 06:41:00,"Hello guys,

Not sure if anyone here can help me or even point me in the right direction, but you have to start somewhere. I am a Sophomore at FSU studying meteorology, I am putting together a list of internships I would like to apply to for Summer 2020 (I know it's a little early and many companies have not posted openings). I was wondering if JetBlue had any type of Summer internship in meteorology available as other airlines like Southwest and Delta do. Thank you in advance."
4,Worst experience,3,8gxz8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/8gxz8n/worst_experience/,1,2018-05-04 13:33:26,"Had one of the worst experience today. Flight got delayed and missed all my connecting international flights. Jetblue booked next ticket which was after 12 hours and didn't provide accommodation or food.

  


Will never use the service again. Delta is best
