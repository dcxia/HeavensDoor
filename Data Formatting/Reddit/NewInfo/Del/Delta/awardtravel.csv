0,Is Amex Platinum worth it purely for Centurion Lounges?,37,croqw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/croqw8/is_amex_platinum_worth_it_purely_for_centurion/,115,2019-08-17 20:59:59,"Planning my next card, it's a toss up between CSR and amex plat for me.

Basically everything I'm reading indicates CSR is the better overall package with easy to use perks and points that go farther. I just got the ink too so those will work together well.

But, I have a couple of big trips firing off in December and do plan on travelling a decent amount the next year (potential trip to Asia and a small handful of domestic trips using companion pass). My home airport is SJC but I will occasionally be flying out of SFO, especially for international.

I use Uber monthly and know how to squeeze the $400 out of the airline credit (the once every calendar year still applies correct?), so I'm not concerned about getting back the AF. It mostly comes down to benefits for me. 

The centurion Lounges are really, really appealing to me, and I think it might be especially nice for my first big international trip to London into the new year to make it a little more special. Whenever I do fly home it also does tend to be Delta, so getting lounge access there is appealing too. I also like (and have used before with gold) the free roadside assistance.

However CSR isn't going to have a nerfed priority pass and gives true primary rental insurance and trip insurance. I don't rent cars often but I am planning to for my London trip. Plus it's easier to just get hard value out of the AF and points. It seems silly to want the platinum just for Centurion, since overall CSR would be the better card, right? But a solid lounge experience is something I actually would like and I do have access to centurion from my local airport and airports I often travel to/from when visiting friends/family.

1,"Award Travel: The bottleneck of churning, a rant after a year of non-stop traveling on points",68,95mhoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/95mhoc/award_travel_the_bottleneck_of_churning_a_rant/,102,2018-08-08 18:30:16,"The following is a reflection of my frustration with award travel prompted by aksurvivorfan’s post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/8xcnaa/discussion_frustrations_with_the_act_of_churning/) on their frustration with churning. Seeing as churning and award travel go hand-in-hand, this is also a word of warning for savy churners looking to transition into the next phase that is award travel. It’s not safe to assume the same success. The process of award travel is much more difficult.

My one year of traveling has come to a close. I haven’t traveled nearly as much as those who do it full-time, but I have spent more than two million miles on flights since 2017. This post is a reflection of some of the frustrations of the miles and points game that are often forgotten and omitted in posts on reddit and in the blogosphere. I went from being an avid fanatic of the hobby with barely any reservations to a huge critic of the many overlooked obstacles of award travel, especially the golden goose that is premium cabins that many, but not all of us, chase. After all, it was the first and business class redemptions rather than mileage currencies itself that got me and most of the people I know interested.

TL:DR: While churning and amassing a huge amount of points is relatively simple and straightforward (give or take the current rules in place and possible future restrictions), maximizing award travel can be quite the opposite, sometimes extremely time consuming and difficult to navigate.

I was introduced to the hobby in 2014 when, out of curiosity, I started looking up first class reviews. I stumbled across the blog, One Mile at a Time, and was blown away on how someone not much older than me was consistently traveling on first class tickets without travel benefits and little out-of-pocket expense. I finally was able to get my first “true” churning card in 2015 and since then have opened up several accounts.

But being both a full-time student and employee, meant that I had almost no time to travel. And when I did have time off, it was at most a week, two if I was lucky. This meant long haul travel was often out of the picture due to time lost in transit which brings me to frustration point #1:

1. You need time to travel.

Now I know most of you already know this as it’s nothing new. However, many of my friends who started with me in this hobby in 2015 are still sitting on the same treasure chest of points with a few redemptions but nothing significant enough to make a sizeable dent in their balance. The biggest constraint for them and many others was finding leave, which tends to be the reason why most people don’t want to do round the world awards that otherwise are one of the best bargains for miles in the business. My solution this past year was to no longer stay a full-time student and employee, which being young and without a family was an easier choice to make than most. But say you are able to find the time to travel, then you soon come to realize the next frustration point.

2.	Finding availability isn’t as easy with miles as with cash.

And this point here, tends to be a real deal breaker, especially if your time off often correlates to holidays when everyone else is off such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s. Or if it’s off-peak, but on an airline that only releases one business seat to partners (ie: Korean Air). Or there’s availability, but only far enough in advance (ie: Qantas or Air New Zealand), but too early enough to guarantee you’ll be authorized leave. Or like Cathay or Lufthansa First, where it requires you to be flexible enough to plan a week or two before your trip. Sometimes the airline is just plain stingy and doesn’t like to release award seats (IE: American Airlines on domestic routes). Another catch is that airlines don’t apply the same supply and demand algorithms to award availability that they do to the usual cash seats. Only a handful of award seats are allocated and then are released and restricted at varying times as you get closer to departure. Maybe it’s an oversimplification, but it’s usually an all or nothing type of ordeal. It goes from saver awards, to unaffordable standard awards, to no availability. Sometimes even in the reverse order.  It’s usually not the gradual change in pricing that you typically see with cash tickets.  Don’t even get me started on trying to find premium availability for parties greater than two. Sometimes you even have to find availability using another airline’s website (British Airways search using American Airlines), or there’s phantom availability, availability not searchable online (Alaska for Cathay), married segment availability (Qatar), and the list goes on and on. But say, you find the availability but as you’re piecing everything together online, an error message pops up. You call the airline up, feed the flights, only to find out your trip is significantly more expensive than expected or that the routing isn’t valid. Here we have frustration point #3.

3.	Your routing isn’t always valid even if it’s logical.

Oh boy does this require TONS of time and research. Especially if you’re trying to go for the real niche redemptions that can save you a bunch of miles. You have so many airline programs accessible with transferable currencies, multiplied by the amount of partners for each airline, and then some. This of course assumes that the airlines actually publish these rules yet alone follows them. Take for example the ninth circle of award redemption hell that is SkyTeam, save for Korean Air. The two most popular members, being Air France/KLM and Delta. Neither publish award charts to add to their already poor search engines. So you get awards that price out contrary to logic (IE: JFK-CDG-ZRH might be cheaper than JFK-CDG). My personal pet peeve is the maximum permitted mileage restriction since many of my routings to Europe require back-tracking by necessity not by choice. American likes to segment cap awards which really punishes those in small airports or prevents routing through third regions with certain exceptions. This is where United really shines, even with the introduction of the Excursionist perk/restriction, MileagePlus is still the most generous among the big three in terms of routing rules. I spent almost every day this past year researching on this topic, and every time I think I come close to mastering a program, I find something new or a program change renders some of my past knowledge obsolete. Say you cross all your t’s and dot all your I’s on your upcoming Etihad first itinerary. You find the time to travel, find the availability, and verify the cost and route validity. You can call American only to find out that they can’t book it nor find the availability. Thus, frustration point #4 is often overlooked.

4.	Booking awards isn’t always straightforward

The example above is caused by US based American Airlines agents being unable to see Etihad first availability, whereas certain call centers like Australia and New Zealand are able to find and book your request. But sometimes it’s not even technical issues like that. YMMV even with the CS reps themselves, especially with one of the off the beaten track currencies like Turkish. One of the top posts on r/awardtravel outlines the process in booking a second first class JAL award seat and it’s a great example of frustration points #2 and #4. It’s great to see how some of the top posts in award travel help breakdown these processes in simple and easy to follow steps to make frustration point #4 much more straightforward. It doesn’t help that airlines love to tack on fees during the booking process: fees for booking close to departure, booking over the phone, booking on partners, etc. In the end, all these fees (sometimes avoidable, not always) make award travel not as free as it’s hyped up to be. I’m sure you can figure out our next frustration point, since people love to advertise award travel as free travel.

5.	Award travel isn’t free and neither are miles.

There are tons of clickbait titles and misleading propaganda on blogosphere and especially YouTube vlogs about how they scored a $XXXXX flight for $5 as the main point rather than the amount of miles used to book the flight. Miles are definitely not free and even if someone offered to cash out my entire point balance at a generous 2 cents per point, I’d still feel short changed. There’s so many rules in regards to taxes and fees yet sometimes the only way you find out is at the final step of the booking process. Taxes and fees vary depending on the currencies used and the airlines redeemed and navigating these can be a huge headache. So while I can redeem 230K United Airlines miles for a roundtrip between HND-FRA in ANA first class for “only” $120, most people would agree that 93K AMEX points with a 30% transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic with $375 in surcharges is a much better redemption. So no, one doesn’t redeem first class ANA for just “$120”. Props if you’ve read this far, as we’ve finally reached the final frustration point.

6.	Information on award travel is not as readily blogged as churning information or trip reports.

I think it’s a shame that there’s more focus on how to accrue points than on how to spend them. At first, this confused me, especially when the latter is much more difficult. What’s the point of churning if you can’t reap the rewards effectively? The cold truth is that blogs and referrals receive commissions on the amount of credit card sign ups, not the amount of award redemptions. In fact, many blogs also profit by offering award booking services so having everyone informed, would be a loss of another revenue stream. I only started browsing flyertalk once I needed information for award redemptions since information on churning is readily available, at times over saturated. For example, there are tons of posts advertising IHG credit cards and how Intercontinental Thalasso is a great redemption of IHG points! $1,000 vs 70K IHG points, 1+ cpp! But there are almost no posts anywhere regarding how to successfully book award nights, even on flyertalk where it becomes obvious it’s a closely guarded secret. There’s a huge discrepancy of information between r/churning and r/awardtravel, and while I think doctorofcredit is the best resource for churning, there’s clearly not as much information on the website for award travel.

In the end, award travel may not be as much of a glorified hobby compared to churning due to its difficulty, but it’s definitely just as important. In fact, I still hesitate pitching churning to certain people who can easily accrue points and succeed in the hobby, but don’t know anything about award travel. There’s little use in collecting a huge sum of points yet unable to redeem them, only for them to be devalued year after year.

I know it might seem like I'm just a cynic and anti-award travel, but I certainly still support this hobby just hopefully with a little more research and awareness from current and upcoming churners.

6,The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend,13,4of6m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4of6m8/the_3_card_las_vegas_weekend/,73,2016-06-16 23:32:27,"##The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend
June 16, 2016

I wanted to share a Las Vegas long weekend trip I just booked when the opportunity came up.  This is something most people can do with a bit of planning and time.  I structured the write-up around a single churner applying for 3 cards.  If you are churning for two, the same trip can be done more efficiently with 4 cards.  You do have to hold one of the cards for more than 1 year, and pay a $49 annual fee.

### The Cards involved

- Chase Sapphire Preferred/Chase British Airways (30K UR/Avios)
- AmEx Starwood Preferred (20K SPG Starpoints)
- Chase IHG (60k IHG AND 1 Annual Free Night after 1 year)

### Booking the Trip

The genesis of the trip was a SPG Moments offer: for 20K SPG points, you can get premium seats for two at a concert at Caesar’s Palace.  This was something we were looking to do over the summer, so having it pop-up was perfect.  It’s unclear what “Premium” seats mean, but decent seats for the concert runs $2-300 per ticket.  So the 20K SPG points is redeeming for something between $4-600 in value.  Flyertalk search showed one report of the seats being in the 8th row, which would indeed be pretty good seats.

**UPDATE** SPG has gotten back to me with the seats.  They are in the orchestra section, and tickets for that section are going for $430 a piece.  So the 20K SPG points bought $860 worth of tickets. 

Las Vegas hotels discounts heavily on a regular basis, so folks often find the best value by just booking a discount rate.  When I started looking at hotels, I start with awardmapper.com.  None of the rates really looked appealing, but as I looked deeper, the Venetian and Palazzo are Intercontinentals, and award nights is priced at 60K.  This means that 2 nights there would be 60K IHG points for the first night, and an annual free night certificate (second night) if you hold the IHG card for a year and pay the $49 AF.  The better plan would be using two annual free night certificates, which I happen to have available.  Booking this was very easy, just login into your IHG account, and use the Book Free Night functionality.  When I looked, the rate per night is $300 at the Palazzo.  So signing up for the IHG card, paying the AF of $49 for the second year, will redeem for a value around $600.  Note, even if the hotel discounts 50%, you are still looking at a $300 redemption.  BTW, I found out afterwards that the hotels are all suites, with 720 sq ft in their standard rooms.  There is a $32 per night Resort fee that needs to be paid on award stays as well, but rumour is that there is a way to get out of it.  Reports also show that IHG Platinum and Spire Elites status means little to nothing at these hotels, so don’t expect an upgrade based on these statuses.  Royal Ambassador does get the expected recognition.

Last step, how to get to Las Vegas.  From Seattle to Las Vegas is just under 1,000 miles, which means if I redeemed Avios from a Chase BA card, or transfer points from UR to Avios, I would spend 30K points for two RTs.  To book, I would use AA.com, and search for awards costing 12.5K AA miles.  I can find award flights on Alaska Air at that redemption cost for both days, and write down the flight numbers.  I would then call BA directly, and booked these flights, as you cannot book Alaska awards on BA.com.  I did all these searches, and seats were available, but the timing of the return flight was atrocious, something to be aware of when looking at award flights.

Note that I describe how it can be done with a CSP or BA Avios card.  In my case, I chose to save my points.  The actual flights at more preferred times on this trip cost about $200 per person.  I also have an Alaska Air companion pass from the Alaska Air card, which makes the 2 RTs cost around $340.  As I value 30K of Avios/UR more than $340, I decided it was more valuable for me to save the points and pay for the flights.  This is purely a personal decision, and only you can decide whether paying for the flights, or using points is a better deal.

Now, what if Alaska air is not a useful redemption from where you live?  The Chase UR points can be transferred to United or Flying Blue, and you can redeem United or Delta award flights.  If your preferred airline is Southwest, then a Chase Southwest card with the 50K sign-up bonus, would very likely get two of you to Vegas with 1 card.  If you get the Companion Pass, it would further halve the cost.

### Takeaways

First of all, this is a pretty simple redemption.  Other than the BA award, you can do everything online.  Secondly, with just 3 cards, you can get a nice little weekend getaway without having to worry about MS or other complexities, and you will likely have some points leftover.  The only gotcha is that you need to get the IHG card, and hold it for a year to get the free annual night.  The ability to redeem at almost all IHG properties make the $49 AF an absolute bargain if you plan any IHG hotel stays over the course of a year.

Next, SPG Moments offer a different dimension on how to use points.  Other than just free nights or airline tickets, you can get some pretty interesting redemptions, such as boxed seats to sporting events, concerts tickets, or even mingling with players at a ball park.  This alone is a pretty good reason to keep on channeling un-bonused spend onto the AmEx SPG card.

Lastly, point valuation is very personal.  Some folks value getting as many free trips as possible, while some may see points as opening doors to premium travel that you wouldn’t really want to pay for in cash.  There is no right answer here.  Whatever works for you, is the best answer.

We got a little of everything in this itinerary from a redemption standpoint: ANA RTW, a ridiculous redemption through the Chase portal, a three-night stay at everyone’s favorite RC Kyoto at the discounted rate, and some questionable single leg bookings. Please read about the process below before commenting on how dumb I was with some of these redemptions :)

**Step One: Planning the Redemptions and Utilizing Marriott’s Hotel + Air Redemption**

Planning how to make this trip possible seemed to change about every other week. As mentioned, this was our first time doing something like this, so I was learning as I was planning. Based on what points and miles we had collected (and what we planned to collect), I planned on the following: Marriott bookings for Tokyo and Kyoto, Chase UR for either Santorini or the Maldives and cash for the other, and a mixture of redemptions through United, Singapore, and/or Turkish of varying classes for the flights (I hadn’t really planned Osaka, Hiroshima, or Miyajima at this point since they were all one night stays). I used the Marriott Hotel + Air package available before the merger to book seven nights in Tokyo and transfer 120k miles to United. At some point (thanks to this subreddit!) I learned about ANA Round the World. We would save a ton of miles and fly biz class across the board at the same time! Unfortunately, there were less than nine months until the trip, and we had essentially nothing in MR. 

**Step Two: Booking the Main Hotel Stays**

While we worked on churning MR for the RTW tickets, I focused on booking our hotel stays. As mentioned, I used the Hotel + Air package for seven nights in Tokyo, and Kyoto was easy enough to figure out; with the category 8 redemption cost not taking effect until March 2019, three nights at the Ritz Carlton at 60k per night was a no brainer. 

My original plan was to stay in Santorini using Chase UR (as they do not really have any big international chains on the island) and use cash to pay for our nights in the Maldives at whatever resort we preferred. I never really considered Hilton points for the Conrad, as we didn’t have time to churn through those cards while prioritizing MR for the RTW tickets. After some research, we decided on Canaves Oia Suites for Santorini and either Huvafen Fushi or Anantara Kivanah for the Maldives. Back before the Chase portal change to be straight up Expedia, though, the hotel we wanted for Santorini wasn’t available, so this got swapped around. We had enough Chase points to cover four nights in the larger (and more expensive) overwater ocean bungalows at HF, and I read on Trip Advisor they have one of if not the best reefs for snorkeling in the Maldives, so I booked both of these using cash and a ton of Chase UR respectively. I know some of you may gawk at using so much UR for four nights, but staying in our number one choice is worth it for us. Churn and burn!
After all that, we did have some Hilton points sitting around that would cover a night in Osaka, but our Marriott points were depleted by the time I got around to Hiroshima and Miyajima. We wanted to try a night at a ryokan for Miyajima anyways, so I used our remaining Chase points for both of these.

**Step Three: Making ANA RTW Work**

Three Amex cards later, we finally had enough MR for two business class ANA RTW tickets. Unfortunately, it was December by the time all the bonuses had posted, and some previous availability had dried up while our dates were more or less set in stone (I really did not want to rework the entire itinerary at this point or bother with rebooking our hotels for different dates). By focusing on TAP Portugal, I was able to find some overseas flights to Europe in J for the first leg, and the last leg from Tokyo to the US wasn’t too hard to find; there were a handful of Asiana options, but I found a United flight with the new 1-2-1 Polaris layout and went with that. The difficult legs were to and from the Maldives. Getting from Male to Osaka wasn’t too difficult, just kinda wonky, but I couldn’t find anything for the inbound leg from Athens. Ultimately, I said screw it and used our AA miles (which aren’t hard to come by anyways) to get from ATH to DOH to MLE on Qatar. It cost 85k miles and little in surcharges but saved us 40k ANA miles and whatever the surcharges would’ve been, so it wasn’t a huge loss. Plus, the additional 45k miles may be worth it for Qatar; their J class looks awesome! I’m excited for our second leg, as it’s the QSuites product. 

You’ll notice from our itinerary, though, inbound and output flights for both Birmingham and Santorini were not included as well as MLE to BLR. As for BHM, there just wasn’t much availability that fit our schedule (as we had to depart Thursday night after work and return the Monday we left Tokyo; Denver was as far as we could get on the return trip). There were some options from Athens to Santorini and vice versa, but the flights were either really early or really late and included about $50 in surcharges per person per flight. Since flights to and from Santorini are cheap anyways, I decided using alternative means would provide more flexibility to enjoy our three night stay. MLE to BLR was supposed to be part of our RTW itinerary, as it was available when I pieced it together on the phone with the ANA agent, but when I called back a few days later to finalize the booking after the points had transferred, Air India flights were no longer available via ANA for some reason, so I covered it with United miles.

**Step Four: Filling in the Gaps**

After the RTW tickets were booked, here’s what was left: getting from BHM to EWR, a hotel stay in Newark, a hotel stay in Athens, getting from Athens to Santorini and back, and getting from Denver to BHM. We had just enough Hilton points to cover a stay near the airport in Newark, so that was taken care of right off the bat. My CSR travel credit posted sometime in February, so I used that for the stay at the hotel near Athens airport; there were cheaper options, but it was convenient and would ensure we could get to bed as quickly as possible off our flight and sleep in a bit if possible to help with jet lag. We also faced spending the night in Doha airport, and even though it wasn’t really necessary, we decided to use my remaining CSR credit and cash to cover a stay at the airport hotel to ensure we would be as rested as we could be on our way to the Maldives. Given it was our honeymoon and we still had money set aside for flights and hotels, we put aside the idea of maximizing value or saving a few hundred more dollars to prioritize convenience and rest. 

All that was left at this point were those remaining legs. This is where I messed up. I had that extra 120k United miles sitting around from the Hotel + Air package, and I was eager to put this all to bed. There was only one option from Denver to Birmingham via United miles anyways, so I forked over 22k a piece to get home. I had used all our Amex airline credits for AA gift cards to get us to NYC, but I did not factor in that the AA flights available did not fly into EWR and we’d be landing late at night. I didn’t want to deal with trying to get to Newark at 1 AM, so I changed plans and transferred Amex to Delta so we could land there and go straight to the hotel (I wanted us to hit the bed as early as possible to try to adjust for the upcoming time difference by waking up early). I went ahead and booked us seats in Comfort+ because why not, it wasn’t that many extra miles and I’m tall, and now I have a bunch of AA gift cards. 

Meanwhile, I kept checking on flights to and from Santorini. I prioritized Olympic, as we’d have two heavy pieces of luggage to check and the budget airlines would bleed us dry after that was factored in. I wanted early afternoon flights for both trips, but all flights around that time were $150 per person. There was an outbound flight available that could be booked via United miles for 8k per person and fees, though, so I went ahead and booked that. Nothing good was available for the inbound trip, so I checked every day for a month until prices dropped. I finally got one for $131 total that included checked luggage, which was great! But then I checked on the outbound flight, and it had also dropped in price to $45 per person, meaning I spent 16k miles and fees for what would’ve been $90. I checked the DEN to BHM flight as well, and it had also decreased in cost both for cash and points. So that whole ordeal was a waste of United miles, but at least it was all small scale and everything was booked.  

**Final Notes**

Congrats if you made it this far! I tried to be as succinct as possible, but there was a lot going on with this itinerary. Some of the redemptions weren't the best, and we could've gotten a lot more value for our points in the long haul if we didn't go absolutely bonkers with it, but I know that we are going to have the trip of a lifetime! In retrospect, given the limited time frame (all the churning happened in less than two years), there's not much I would change. I definitely would have prioritized the ANA RTW tickets first to improve what legs were available, and I'd want a do-over on booking those small legs at the end, but that's about it really! **A huge thanks to this sub for helping make this possible!** I have no idea what this trip would've been without all the advice and information I got from here.

EDIT: Forgot to include this in the original post, but we'll be staying 3 nights in Santorini, 4 nights in the Maldives, and 13 nights in Japan, with one night stops in Newark, Athens, and Doha between flights. We'll be gone for 25 days total including flights. 

EDIT 2: Adjusted redemption table for the DEN -> BHM leg to reflect the price decrease I mentioned; $750 was the price at the time of booking, it has since gone down."

Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say “Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what?”

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program’s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program’s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline’s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won’t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don’t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE’s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR’s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let’s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don’t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are “Savers” awards, and “Anytime” awards.  

“Savers” are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline’s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

“Anytime” are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I’m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay’s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it’s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It’s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United’s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let’s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don’t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won’t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don’t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can’t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don’t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven’t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let’s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline’s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like “Use Miles”.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let’s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn’t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline’s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people’s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for “Mixed Class”, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can’t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let’s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it’s own, but I’ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people’s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don’t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline’s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip…

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can’t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You’ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don’t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you’ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state “On Request”.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to “Ticketed”.  In the past, I’ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline’s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline’s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don’t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn’t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don’t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

##What is next?

There are tons of topics we did not cover in this Basics guide.  How to transfer Points, how to actually search for rewards, how to determine which FF to use, etc.  Let me know what topics you would like to see me cover in the future.

I’m looking moreso towards Asia but let’s not limit it so we can share all our favorite redemptions to all over."
11,2020 Honeymoon Booked! MCO-JFK-CDG / CPH-JFK-MCO Thanks r/AwardTravel!,44,chbrt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/chbrt1/2020_honeymoon_booked_mcojfkcdg_cphjfkmco_thanks/,65,2019-07-24 22:12:34,"Title says it all - thanks to this sub for the help (exclusively used the sidebar!). TL;DR at bottom :)


**Background**

We planned to fly from MCO to CDG, spend a few days there, then take a cruise that ended in Copenhagen and fly back to Orlando. Because of the cruise, we had pretty firm dates on flying there and flying back.


**Points**

\~197K Delta SkyMiles (across 2 accounts; 147K/50K)

\~236K Marriott Bonvoy (all in 1 account) + 1 Free Night Cert

\~210K Chase UR (not used - all still available!)

&#x200B;

**Travel**

So because our Delta SkyMiles were spread out over 2 different accounts, we ended up both booking a portion of the trip on our individual accounts. We were diligent to book the flights a little less than one year out, which meant best award availability.


* **MCO - JFK (round trip)**: booked on 50K account, 23.5K Delta SkyMiles per person (comfort+). At time of booking, flight was $389.60 for a valuation of 1.66 vs. TPG valuation of 1.2. Horray!


* **JFK - CDG; CPH - JFK (multi-city):** booked on 147K account, 59K Delta SkyMiles per person (comfort+). At time of booking, flight was $1,028.33 for a valuation of 1.74 vs. TPG valuation of 1.2. Horray!


**Hotels**

Overall, needed 3 nights in Paris (specific dates) and one night in Copenhagen (specific date). For Paris, ended up booking 3 nights at a Cat 4. At time of booking, hotel was $231.00 but paid 25K/night for a valuation of 0.924 vs. TPG valuation of 0.8. Horray!


For Copenhagen, ended up booking 1 night at a Cat 5 and used the free night cert (35K). At time of booking, hotel was $411.00 for a valuation of 1.17 vs. TPG valuation of 0.8. Horray!


**Overall**

Ended up burning through most of 50K skymiles from one account and 118K from the other account while still being able to keep \~30K miles. Additionally, only spent 75K bonvoy points at a great value and still have 161K available. Also, didn't have to touch our 210K UR points... but they're burning a hole in our pockets!


**TL;DR** \- Booked entire honeymoon using award miles/points at fantastic valuations and still have some to spare. Thank you!"
12,Traveling to Japan? Read this,82,8jo1uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/8jo1uc/traveling_to_japan_read_this/,58,2018-05-15 22:46:17,"We've seen a LOT of travel to Japan posts recently. I would like to revive this post from /u/hidingfrommywife1 on booking ANA F through VS: https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6e82ub/detailed_walkthrough_on_how_to_fly_to_tokyo_in/

tldr: search availability on United.com, identify ""saver"" award flights operated by ANA, call VS at 800.365.9500, feed them flight times + flight class, put flight on hold for 24h (free), transfer points (instant), call back and confirm ticket.

*When searching on United.com, I recommend searching for ""nonstop only"", award flights (obviously), and picking business or first for class of service. Then, once you're on the actual results page, you can use the 30-day calendar in the middle of the screen. With those filters in place, anything on the calendar with 110k will be saver availability (for F, that is)

F: 110k ~~SEA~~, ~~SJC~~, SFO, LAX - 120k JFK, ORD, IAH, IAD

J: 90k - 95k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Y: 60k - 65k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Booking through ANA:

[Low/Regular/High Seasons (also where I obtained these mileage values)](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/int/usage.html)

Y: 40,000	50,000	55,000	

J: 75,000	85,000	90,000

F: 150,000	150,000	165,000



Other common questions:

* You can transfer to VS from all major currencies
* You can only transfer MR to ANA
* NRT and HND are co-terminals. You can fly into one and out the other
* You can redeem as an open jaw. Any US Airport  serviced by ANA -> either TYO airport. Either TYO airport -> any US airport serviced by ANA
* Is F worth it? Yeah its pretty cool. But J would probably adequately satisfy you. The reason F is more popular is because J availability is somewhat scarce. 110/120k on VS versus ~85k biz (either booking method) isn't that much worse though. ANA F for 150k is probably not worth it.
* F is cool but not that great for flying with a companion (hard to talk to them)
* Other choices: you can also get to TYO on United (lots of miles) [or using AA miles on JAL](https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/redeem/award-travel/oneworld-and-other-airline-partner-award-chart.jsp)  (find availability on ba.com, call aa to book), and through Delta."

&#x200B;

I travel a lot for work (40% of the time) and I get to keep all the miles and points. So far this has landed me elite status in all Hilton hotels and National Car Rental. Besides I'm a Gold medallion on Delta. My problem is that I have been using the Delta AMEX for all my expenditure and I do not know if I am getting the best out of all my expenses. I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred and was thinking about start using it for traveling expenditure. I have gotten a lot of miles out of my Delta card, but it is barely enough to fly to Japan in coach (125k miles). 

&#x200B;

I have spent 30k on traveling this year alone and always pay my card in full every month. Any suggestions on what card I should use?

I’m about to hit gold with AAdvantage but my experiences with American so far have been pretty underwhelming. I also didn’t realize that AA doesn’t just automatically add you to the upgrade list on flights like delta and that the odds of me even clearing an upgrade out of Chicago are slim. I really liked delta - used to get upgraded a lot even as a silver medallion and recently have been finding great award redemptions too (12k for rt flights from Chicago to both coasts). The only problem is the lack of direct flights to Boston, SF and LA - which means I’d have to connect each time I flew there.

Should I hit gold on American and then status match back to silver on delta and go back to using delta? Or stick with American?

P.s. I’ve vowed to boycott United. "

I don't know if it was possible to combine 4 and 7, but overall I'm moderately satisfied happy with my trip.

EDIT: I added that we wanted to go around the world, and that the SO can't really take much time off of work. The goal was to sleep on each leg of the ride. I could have saved points by leaving the next morning from LAX, but the schedule wouldn't take opportunity of being able to rest before getting to MLE. I've adjusted my itinerary to leave SJC a little earlier for 669 more points.

**TL;DR 418,480 Chase pts + 2,997 SW pts + $2296.05 for Around the world trip with stops at Maldives, Tokyo, and Hawaii."

1. Spend 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai (100k UR points + 2 free nights from Hyatt card)

2. Fly to Maui and spend 4 nights at the Marriott Wailea Beach Resort (160k points). I don't have enough points for this, so not sure what the backup plan is. 

3. Flights. This is where I get confused. I was planning on booking Korean air, but since we're not married yet I found out we can't do that. 


**I also  tried these flight options**

*A. Someone recommended Air France to me, but checking on their website shows no flights to Hawaii. I'm assuming I'm looking incorrectly somehow?

*B. American Airlines, but it looks to be 50k miles round trip per person. Not sure if open jaws are possible (IE SLC to kaui to Maui to SLC)

*C. Delta -- I can do SLC -> LIH -> OGG -> SLC but it appears to be 100k miles per person. 

*D. Alaskan -- Shows no award availability



If someone could just point me in the right direction on what to research that'd be awesome. I'd obviously love to do first class, but if that's not possible we'll survive :)

19,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Chase URs,67,49tbx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbx6/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_chase_urs/,52,2016-03-10 16:03:42,"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/), I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:


***Chase URs***

Chase offers only one personal card that allows for the transfer of Ultimate Rewards points to airline partners – the Sapphire Preferred card. Chase is pretty strict with their approvals for this card, so if you have picked up more than 5 credit cards in the past 24 months, chances are good you will be denied if you apply for this card, so plan accordingly/carefully.

Your URs will transfer to 6 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your URs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Korean Air**

Korean Air is a SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can redeem your SkyPass miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Korean Air is largely considered to be one of the best bang for your buck redemptions to Europe in general and is the best option among UR transfer partners.

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 50k miles for coach, 80k miles for business class and 100k miles for first class – which is the best option for premium cabin redemptions to Europe. Korean Air does allow for one-way award tickets, but as u/wiivile pointed out, the cost is the same for a one-way award as it is for a roundtrip. You are also allowed one stopover on a one-way award ticket and two stopovers on a roundtrip award ticket, which is truly incredible considering you are already getting one of the best redemption rates to Europe to begin with.

While Korean Air Skypass miles offer one of the best values, it can be difficult to work with Korean Air. If you are planning to use your miles to book an award ticket for another person, that other person has to be a family member (mother, father, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, wife, husband or child). You will also need to call in to Korean Air to book your award and the process is somewhat arduous. I would recommend that you call in to make sure space is available and then place a hold on your award ticket(s) before transferring your URs to your Skypass account.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your URs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**United**

United is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. As with Singapore Airlines, that means you are going to have a ton of options!

United uses a two-tier award system for their awards. Economy tickets are the same cost regardless of whether you are on a United flight or a partner flight. A roundtrip saver coach award ticket will cost you 60k miles.

Business and first class award tickets on the other hand will differ in price depending on whether you are flying on a United operated flight or a partner operated flight. For United operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 115k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 160k miles. Alternatively, for partner operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 140k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 220k miles.

As you can see, the much better value when redeeming for premium cabins is with United operated flights – though the actual product is going to be far less enticing than what some of United’s partners such as Swiss Air offer. Since Singapore Airlines would have access to much of the same award inventory as United, you are better off transferring your URs to them instead and then booking the exact same flights for 5-60k miles less.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the worst UR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Southwest**

Unfortunately Southwest does not currently fly to Europe, nor do they have any partners that fly to Europe. If you have a Chase co-branded Southwest credit card, there is a way around this to use your RapidRewards points for international travel, but the value is usually exceedingly poor and I will not get into how to do so here as it will rarely work out in your favor.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your URs!"
20,List: When Airlines Open Award Availability,166,c4w38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c4w38p/list_when_airlines_open_award_availability/,51,2019-06-25 01:26:29,"Here is a list of some airlines and a VERY incomplete list of when they open up award availability. Some of the dates, I have verified. Others I have not and I know some are wrong. I live 16-19 time zones away from most of you, so many dates are +- a day. Due to my time zone “issues,” my strategy is to look a week or two before I think my days are bookable and use that to calibrate the exact day I can book.

Sometimes time zones make a difference if you want to snag an award that is released on a schedule. As a general rule, if the booking airline is the limiting one, it will be released according to their time zone. If the operating carrier is the limiting one, there is a higher chance it will be released based off of the operating carriers time zone.  As a general rule, an airline cannot book partner award space before they open up bookings for their own space.  Qantas is one exception to this rule.

Please help complete this list. It is old and out of date. Feel free to correct dates, add airlines, or add dates.

**Edit: How to use this list.** If you are booking a partner award look at the line for the airline you are looking to fly **and** the airline that operates the mileage program you are booking through. The lower of the two numbers is when you can book the seat. Example: Booking JAL via AA. JAL seats become available at 360 days and AA allows booking 331 days out.  You can book these seat 331 days out. Remember that the time zone of the more restricted airline/program is what matters.

If you are trying to book a seat with a program that does not allow you to book at schedule opening, like the JAL example.  You can check JAL's website at 331+ to get an idea of what seats will be available when AA gets access to JAL's space.

The exact time of day does matter for some bookings.  Please leave any time DP you have in the comments.

With This Exclusive Deal, Now Is The Time To Try A Delta Vacations Package

Your dream getaway is now in reach. 

For this week only, miles are worth double with Delta Vacations when you book any vacation package. Now, $1,000 towards a vacation package costs 50,000 miles instead of 100,000 miles.

ETA: called, you don't have to book hotel the entire trip and can book mutli-city over the phone. Hotel stay minimums depend on destination: 2 nights CONUS, 3 nights Europe, 4 nights Asia. Hotels do not need to be consecutive or in the same city.

Due to work and planned leisure trips I will be flying ALOT in 2019, enough to earn Delta Diamond or United Premier 1k by the end of the year. I currently have Delta Gold (with not much rollover MQMs) which I can easily complete the status match with United on my first few trips. I'm looking for some insight from both elite programs to help me decide!

Home airport: BDL (so neither United/Delta hub, both fly there and prices for each are pretty cheap). Also an easy train ride to NYC

Planned trips
-Domestic flights 3x a month (everywhere, both United and Delta Hubs) 

-London and Shanghai in March

-Sydney in June

-RTW trip using Amex MR points in July-Aug for vacation (exploring mainly SEA)

Right now I have 100k+ miles from Delta, but the Star Alliance network seems so much better from what I heard. Also, I have Amex platinum which gives me Delta lounge with domestic flights, but honestly I find escape lounges/PP restaurants better anyways. 

Would love to hear opinions!"

Because this trip is for our anniversary I want to splurge on business class for the transatlantic legs since my husband has only ever flown premium economy and never been overseas.

I am open to any suggestions. My only true limitation is that the trip must occur in April and it must occur over continuous weeks (ie a Sunday to Saturday, not a Wednesday to a Tuesday).

26,PSA: Availability matters more than award charts,41,800nzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/800nzl/psa_availability_matters_more_than_award_charts/,45,2018-02-25 02:59:55,"A lot of folks have dropped by lately having read about the sweetest sweet spots in award charts and wanting help booking them. Given the large number of blog articles touting these it's easy to develop unrealistic expectations around the possibility of booking these awards.

Most of the very best award chart sweet spots involve partner awards with limited availability. For example, you can use Korean Air Skypass points to book flights on Delta. However, the number of seats available if you're using the Korean Air program is much more limited than if you're using the (often more expensive) Delta SkyMiles program.

Think of frequent flier programs as a department store, and pricing as follows:

* Standard award rates: Full price. When you're shopping in a department store for the latest fashion that is in high demand, you may be able to buy it, but you won't get a bargain.
* Saver award rates: Clearance sale. When you're shopping clearance sales, you're buying fashion out of season, or stuff that didn't sell. It's the same thing with airline seats. The best seats at the best times of year to the best destinations aren't the ones that you can get for a sale price.
* Factory Outlet Sale: You know those factory outlet stores? The ones in the distant, distant, distant suburbs where you can score some incredible bargains (far better than even a department store clearance sale) on an extremely limited selection, and with no real idea before you get there what you might find? That's a partner award chart sweet spot. Also, there are no refunds or returns.

So, is it impossible to score a great deal, like a 25k mile roundtrip flight to Hawaii? Nope! If you like the thrill of the hunt and are willing to turn over rocks to find a great bargain, you can do this. It isn't easy, though, and you will need to be really flexible, and you may need to comply with strange rules like faxing in a copy of your marriage certificate. If you want a refund, this might be complicated (or it might be easier, depends on the program). And this usually works best if you only want one or two seats. 

Should you pass up a good sale on something you want just because at some point, someone might have gotten (or might later get) a better deal in a factory outlet store? Of course not. Although buying a standard award fare is (like paying full price at a department store) rarely a good deal, saver awards usually offer solid value. Even if you don't manage to land the cheapest sweet spot on the cheapest award chart, saver awards can still be a great deal."

35,[Huge issue] AA doesn't consider pre-clearance while accounting for Minimum Connecting Time,0,9oljo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/9oljo5/huge_issue_aa_doesnt_consider_preclearance_while/,41,2018-10-16 12:04:55,"**PLEASE READ FULL POST BEFORE DOWNVOTING/COMMENTING.**

So, here's the issue:

I'll arrive at JFK via an AA-partnered international flight and will have to take a domestic AA flight to CLT, all on the same ticket.

But my incoming flight at JFK would've had pre-clearance, so no customs clearance or immigration check-in would be required. My baggage will be transferred to AA due to an inter-line agreement between AA & its partner.

AA is not allowing me to book another flight that's after 65 minutes of my arrival into JFK, as its systems determine the MCT (Minimum Connecting Time) for an international flight to domestic flight connection at JFK to be 120 minutes. However, flights that've had pre-clearance should be treated as domestic! So, AA should use its domestic MCT value while calculating feasibility of an itinerary, if an international flight has had pre-clearance!

Because of this issue, AA has put me on a domestic flight that's late 38% of the time, with 58 minutes as the average delay. I've another flight after this one, which is 44 minutes later. But if the chronically-delayed flight would be delayed, I'd miss the next segment & the next AA flight to the destination would be after 11 hours, and of course, AA won't pay for a hotel, if it screws me over!

I've spoken to AA agents, a supervisor & her manager, but they told me they can't override it as it's 'illegal' and that the FAA would fine them 25k per incident. AFAIK, the 'illegality' is internal AA lingo for in-feasibility, and not related to any law.

How can I override the MCT set by AA? Has anyone had success in doing so?

For Delta, MCT for connections involving international flights that've had pre-clearance, to domestic flights, is 30 minutes.

&#x200B;

**TLDR** \- For connections from international flights with pre-clearance to domestic flights, Minimum Connecting Time should be considered to be that of domestic flights, because the flights of the former type are treated as domestic flights (customs-clearance & immigration check-in is completed at pre-clearance sites). American Airlines uses the MCT for international flights to domestic flights, while Delta is saner in this regard (and maybe its ticketing staff is saner too. Delta staff has never asked me to go fly with the competition)."

- Timeframe - travel before and after the 4th of July (high season)
-  Destination choices from LA -  NYC, DC, Philly, Boston, Hawaii, Costa Rica, Cancun (as you can see, we were open to go just about anywhere)
- Points budget - no more than 25K/person roundtrip (I made sure I have enough remaining for other trips planned in the fall.

I checked United, British Avios, Singapore Air, Korean Air, Delta, Jet Blue, Southwest - made multiple calls to no avail. The only thing that worked out, ironically since the available dates were for around the 4th of July, was British Avios from LAX to Maui.

You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your URs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your TYPs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days

Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

Airline | Alliance | Total Mileage Balance

Qatar	 | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 175,000 Miles
United Airlines | Star Alliance | 99,000 Miles
EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for “yyy Award Chart” (with ‘yyy’ being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you’re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control – regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA’s award chart – not LAN’s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the process that I use for determining the best redemption value for my points and miles, so hopefully it helps shed some light on how to find the best redemption value for your trip."
39,Award Flights to New Zealand Booking Experience,141,bpb0ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bpb0ra/award_flights_to_new_zealand_booking_experience/,42,2019-05-16 14:48:45,"I currently live in New Zealand and have booked 15-20 USA-New Zealand J awards in the past 18 months using many programs. With the addition of AA and United flying nonstop, it has become less of a unicorn than it was. It does involve a little more planning. Here is a lot of the information that I have learned about the specific route and my general booking process.  I have included many booking options but ran out of steam to include them all. It may also ramble since it was mainly written to pass time without internet coverage in the car.

  
**Nonstop**  
**Air New Zealand (NZ)**  
This space is hard to come by in J. A little easier in Y. The best way to look for space is an Expert Flyer alert since availability tends to be random if it opens up at all. More likely, one seat to open up, but I have seen multiple. More offseason space released. YVR, SFO, LAX, IAH, ORD, HNL.   
**United (UA)**  
Nonstop year round SFO-AKL, during \~April-October it does not fly every day. They do open up J space randomly on this route. I have seen 8+ J seats available, but this is an exception, not the rule. Do not expect saver availability around Christmas. I have seen J space released to partners. SFO.   
**American (AA)**  
Nonstop LAX-AKL daily seasonal, roughly November-March. They do release space on this route, but the release is not predictable. Some are close in, and some are further out. I have seen a lot of married segment logic on this route. PHX is a good city to use if you are looking for a default city that shows most married segment logic. LAX.   
**Air Canada**  
Nonstop YVR-AKL, 4X week, mid-December- end March. This route is brand new (hasn’t been flown yet), but they have released some J space. I anticipate there will be some changes for the 2020/21 “season” after they see how the route does. YVR. 

  
**Connections**  
Three main regions are used for connections to New Zealand: Australia, South Pacific, and Asia. Not all programs allow you to connect through all the regions. Almost all allow you to connect through Australia. If you are connecting through Australia on NZ a320/a321s they are a one cabin aircraft and do not have J (772, 773, and 787 do have J).

  
**Booking Through Award Programs**  
**AA**  
Their routing rules allow you to connect through the South Pacific and Australia to New Zealand, but not through Asia. AA is a pain to search since they often show a domestic F flight and a TPAC economy flight as a J award.  
Direct: Flying the seasonal AA LAX-SFO route  
Australia: Flying AA or Qantas to Australia and then Qantas to AKL, WLG, CHC, or ZQN. Qantas opens up flights \~360 days, which can reduce availability for AA at 330 days.   
Air Tahiti New: Decent availability has been showing in J without overnight connections when the schedule opens. Shows on AA’s website and flies to AKL.  
Fiji: Not the best product and availability is hit or miss. Remember to search for flights to AKL, WLG, and CHC since sometimes availability isn’t available on the final leg to each destination.  
Qatar: This counts as two awards and is in the process of getting Qsuites. Availability has been pretty decent for AKL-DOH in late 2018/early 2019.    
**ANA(NH)**  
This is the program that it is the easiest to find availability to New Zealand since they allow you to create your a routing with three connections. You have to fly TPAC, must book roundtrip, and are allowed one stopover. ANA’s search engine is pretty limited when searching, but you can use a multi-destination search to “force” your routing. ANA’s search engine typically does not include flights that connect from the US to ICN, TPE, PEK, or PVG on their searches. Remember to search for AKL, WLG, CHC, and ZQN. It can be time intensive to find an award, but I have never not been able to piece together a J award. Singapore opens up a decent amount of space on their AKL-SIN and WLG-SIN (regional product).   
**Alaska (AS)**  
Alaska has a different award chart for each of their partners. You can mix Alaska flights with a partner, but you cannot use multiple partners on one ticket. You are allowed a stopover on a one-way award. This gives you more flexibility since your TPAC and flight to NZ can have availability on separate days.   
Cathay Pacific: Must be booked via phone, use BA or QF to find availability, but keep in mind CX often releases one less seat to AS than One World partners. AKL, CHC  
Fiji: Can be searched on AS. Availability is sometimes different than Expert Flyer. AKL, WLG, CHC  
Qantas: Can be searched on AS. AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN  
Korean: Must book roundtrip. Searchable on AS. AKL  
**Avianca/Lifemiles**  
I have seen a lot of restrictions on what routes you can book with Lifemiles to New Zealand. They tend to be more restrictive than UA and ANA, but I still have found availability with them. You generally cannot create your routing. They do allow Asia connections.   
**Cathay**  
You can get additional award availability if you book directly. AKL and CHC.   
**Delta**  
Delta does not fly to New Zealand, and the rates are typically extremely high. They are partners with Virgin Australia, and you can connect through Australia. China Eastern (PVG), China Southern (CAN), Korean (ICN), and China Airlines (TPE-BNE-AKL) are Sky Team members that fly to AKL.   
**JAL**  
The cheapest way to book Emirates from AKL. Leaving AKL the YQ (fuel surcharge) is pretty low. The other One World information applies, watch for YQ. The rates tend to be reasonable, but the miles are tough to get. You can book 360 days out and will have access to One World inventory 360 days out.  
**Qantas**  
The advantage of booking directly with Qantas is that you can book \~360 days out and they sometimes release availability at the start of the schedule for their US routes. There is YQ, and the mileage amounts are typically higher than booking via AA.  
**Singapore**  
Partner award rates are very high, and UA in most cases would be a better option. If you want to fly SQ TPAC in a premium cabin, you almost always need to book directly through SQ since they basically never release those seats to partners. Starting in 2018 it does seem that there are releasing a lot more J space to partners from SIN-AKL/WLG/Australia  
**United**  
UA lets you route through Asia to get to New Zealand. The routes that they allow are highly variable and hard to figure out. I recommend searching for many US cities and AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN. UA’s issues booking various Asian carriers award space has reduced space connecting in Asia. You cannot piece together your own award. You can currently waitlist flights on UA metal and prepay for them (not sure if this is/will be possible after November 15). I have had success on the AKL-SFO route with this clearing 48 hours before departure.   
**Virgin Atlantic (VS)**  
Most of the talk with VS is about booking ANA to Japan. They have a great rate on NZ metal of 62.5k in J between the US and New Zealand (transfer bonuses put this between 48-55k). The issue is that this is the unicorn flight (unless you are flying May-August). There is award space released randomly, and Expert Flyer is your best bet. I have managed to book this award before.  A good option for May-August when NZ released more space.

  
**Strategy**   
I first decide what is my optimal booking. Do I want to fly CX, nonstop, stopover in Asia/Fiji? Then I look at how many seats I am trying to book. I then figure out when award seats open up for my desired booking. If I am not at that date, I monitor what award seats become available and if I think it will open up at schedule opening. If the schedule is already open, I search to see if there is availability. If there isn’t, I search for other routes. If I cannot find any award availability that pops up in searching, there are 3 main options I consider.   
\-Booking with ANA via Asia. You can create your own itinerary, and as long as you can find a TPAC to somewhere in Asia you should be able to stitch together a routing. This does take some time. 

\-Set Expert Flyer alerts for every nonstop NZ, UA, and AA nonstop flight that would work. Space does come available randomly.   
\-If there is UA economy saver space, waitlisting J via UA.   


I am willing to book a one-way flight and wait for a return flight. The only exception is mid-December through mid-January.   
Through the entire process, I keep in mind how many tickets I am trying to book.   
1 ticket- Higher likelihood of NZ award seat becoming available. Higher likely of AA seat becoming available within 90 days.   
2 tickets- Nonstop flights are still a possibility. NZ frequently only releases 1 J seat on many of their Asia routes at schedule opening so I count on them. A very doable number.   
3+ tickets- This gets tricky. I have seen UA release I9, which is at least 9 J award seats. This is not normal. The ANA route can be a little more difficult with 3+. The TPAC will be your most challenging flight, followed by the last flight to New Zealand, but there are frequently 3+ seats between New Zealand and Australia. UA waitlist on separate PNRs is a good backup if you can find saver Y.

edit: A lot of the routing rules and general information of this post apply when flying to Australia since almost all award charts combing Australia and New Zealand in the same region. The capacity to Australia is about 4-5 times greater than New Zealand and I have not included a breakdown of flights to Australia."

I like hiking and outdoor activities, so my only limiting factor would be the seasons on where I want to go. For example, I'd like to plan a trip with stops in Norway and Iceland to do some hiking, then finish up in Dublin to relax a little before heading home.

43,Florida Keys Vacation,20,cjcsa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cjcsa6/florida_keys_vacation/,43,2019-07-29 19:30:27,"Hi all,

I'm trying to put together a somewhat economical trip for my family of 4 to go down to Key West for 5 nights somewhere around the dates of Mar 13-18 (with some flexibility), flying from Asheville, NC.  Here are the points that I am working with:

Delta: 77k (Currently Silver)

Hilton: 240k (Currently Gold)

Hyatt: 50k (Currently Discoverist)

Barclays CC Points: 85k (Worth $850 in travel credits)

So far, I have found flights from AVL to EYW for $388 each, or 34k points each +$11.  My thought is to get 2 tickets with Delta points, and then cover the remaining $776 with my Barclays points.

For hotels, I'm seeing a number of options:

Hyatt Centric Key West: 25k Hyatt Points per Night

Hilton Garden Inn Key West: 60k Hilton Points per Night

Casa Marina Key West: 90k Hilton Points per Night

Baker's Cay Resort: 80k Hilton Points per Night

The Reach Waldorf Astoria: 80k Points per Night

My initial thought is to do a stay at the 60k Hilton Garden Inn for the first night, and then finish out the remaining 4 nights at one or two of the fancier resorts.  Maybe 2 nights at the Hyatt Centric, and 2 nights at The Reach Waldorf Astoria?

Quick questions:

* I was trying to find a good way to swing the 5th night free with Hilton, but other than the Garden Inn I wouldn't have enough points to make that happen.  Anything I am missing here?
* Many of these resorts have $50-ish per night resort fees.  Any idea if those are still charged with points redemptions?
* Is it wise to book this far ahead in advance?  Any idea what the sweetspot would be for booking a March trip?
* Does anyone have experience with any of these hotels, or which would be the best bang for the buck?
*  This would be my first trip to the Keys, so any suggestions/recommendations would be helpful!

Thanks in advance."

49,Atlanta to Johannesburg RT in Delta One Suites for 94k MR + $55 – Booking Success,49,bpcpc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bpcpc9/atlanta_to_johannesburg_rt_in_delta_one_suites/,38,2019-05-16 17:42:29,"  I just booked a trip to go on a safari and visit Cape Town pretty much exactly 11 months in advance, and have never seen a post about this booking so figured I would share. Booking Delta One ATL-JNB is 60k Virgin Atlantic miles each way, however using the current MR promo brought it down to 94k RT. If you are looking to book this, you will most likely have to jump on booking the outbound flight first as soon as the schedule opens, and then being patient and waiting for the flight home to open up and booking that separate. Once I booked the outbound leg, I was fully prepared for a situation where I would have to fly home using a different strategy so keep that in the back of your mind, as I was a little less flexible with my date to fly home.

When searching to book this, I found that the outbound ATL-JNB leg is easier to find, with 2 J seats opening up on average 3-4 days of the week when looking out exactly 11 months, the JNB-ATL leg for me was a lot more hit or miss, I booked my flight home today and there was more than 4 seats available on Saturday, April 11th, but before that the only availability was the Tuesday prior. Saturday/Sunday seem to have more availability, for booking the outbound I put the flight on hold for 72 hours and waited to make sure I was flying outbound on the best possible day to optimize travel.

I will be positioning from Texas, with a quick 2 hour flight the night prior to keep it safe, and would imagine this would not be a problem for anybody on the east coast, as flights to ATL are around $100 each way. I don’t like using CPP but in this case the total flight cost is in the range of 8-10k USD. Lastly, while the current flights are not delta one suites, when choosing a seat a year in advance it does show that will be the future layout."

**Backstory** - I'm a US expat and travel hacker living in Sydney with my wife. We've been here for 6 months and seen a lot of the same questions about the area get posted almost daily. I'll do my best to concisely run through a number of topics here, whether it be about getting here or what to do, in the hopes this makes future questions a little more tactical.  
  
##NOTE: PLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE! 
###Update 1 - Added booking windows and intra-region travel info. 

##Getting Here
###Cash
Great deals to be had lately in economy. Prices have consistently dropped $800 or so from mainland USA on full service carriers. These sales are pretty frequent. If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve card a $800 cash ticket is just over 53,000 Ultimate Rewards points with FULL points earn on the ticket itself. That's a great deal if you don't care about sitting up front.  
Business class is significantly more expensive. This is one of the most sought after premium class routes on the planet and with that prices tend to stay high and award availability low. 

####From the East Coast of the US  
I highly recommend AA to DFW and Qantas DFW-SYD. The route is served by a comfortable A380 (good economy, dated 2-2-2 J though) and loads are typically intentionally kept low heading East to maximize cargo capacity. That means you can realistically expect a empty middle seat if you plan well. On the eastbound side it's still possible but less likely. Also, if you fly on low days you may score an upgrade for $1,000 - $1,200 USD per person, per way, via Qantas' bid for upgrade program. Really the major benefit here is connections going further into the US - minimizing travel time on either side of that long leg is incredibly more valuable and comfortable.

####From the West Coast of the US
Any carrier works here, chose based on your preference. Every domestic carrier serves the route (UA/AA/DL) and most are newer aircraft (sans Delta's aging 777s). You can also find good deals via Fiji as well as via Auckland on Air New Zealand. I personally don't like breaking up the trip any more than necessary so I don't like those options.  

###Points  
Oh boy, this is a good one. Generally the rule of thumb is simply this, **PLAN AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO FLY UP FRONT!** The only exception to this is Virgin Australia who sometimes releases J space < 2 weeks of travel. That's absolutely rolling the dice though. Economy wise you can typically find space on at least one carrier so that's less of a topic, and as above, with cash prices being so low it can often be less worthwhile to book the award itself.  
Up front you really have a few options.   
 &nbsp;  

**US Carriers**  
 &nbsp;  
  
Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---
United | 338 | Good J hard product, meh soft product. Awards open up here and there but typically it's very limited to last minute redemption. Price-wise, they're not the cheapest, but not the most expensive.  
AA | 331| probably the best hard produce from the group. Same meh soft product (they're US carriers after all). Pricing is also okay, but availability is next to none.  
Delta | 331| bad products, hard and soft. The seats are old, the service is older. Price is highest BUT you will often find saver-level seats on Virgin Australia (a partner) < 2 weeks out.  
   &nbsp;  
**Australian Carriers**  
 &nbsp;

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Qantas| 353 | meh J product (2-2-2). Good/Great F. Service is also good, very polished. Availability in spurts, but okay price via AA.   
Virgin Australia | 330 | best seat (the Business) and I'm a sucker for a bird with a bar. Conversely, terrible availability unless you're looking within 2 weeks or right at the window. 
 &nbsp;  
**Asian Carriers (generally better availability)**  
 &nbsp;  

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Korean | 360? | my personal favorite. Great airline, great US service, and a transfer partner of Chase. And most importantly, they tend to be quite generous with their availability. 
Cathay | 360 | old favorite in the points world. Not the cheapest option but if you have the points then you'll often find availability through HKG when you book at the window. Great seat, classic service, and AMAZING lounges in HKG. 
JAL | 330 | like ANA, in light of recently US carrier devaluations these guys have become a viable option through Tokyo. Some recommend their 777 SkySuite as the best J product out there. 
SQ | 355 | Suites are always a favorite but lately it's pretty impossible to not pull your hair out before actually confirming that route. J availability tends to show up here and there. Recently devauled though so use tool to find best option based on points available. 
ANA | 356 | mentioned in JAL topic, just a solid all around option if you have the points. 
 &nbsp;  
**Award Tools**  
Look, I know a lot of carriers were mentioned above and you're probably going well, that's all great, but how do I ultimately choose one given the fact that I have a trip 1+ year out and a few options? That's where the below sites come in handy. They will tell decipher award charts and help you distill down the airlines that you can realistically fly given the points that you have.

##Once In The Region
###Intra-Region Travel 
  
* Staying in the South/South East (SYD/BNE/MEL/PER/etc.) - Avios, Avios, Avios! SYD-MEL, for example, is 4,500 Avios one way on Qantas. This is an amazing sweet spot. 
* Cross Country Travel - This is tough. Economy prices aren't terribly high, but the business class product on these flights is top notch. Virgin flies ""The Business"" A330 and Qantas flies an equivalent A330 through the continent and they really cater to those premium travelers. I still haven't come up with the best way of doing this with points though local frequent flyers swear by the points upgrade to get up front. 
* Across the Ditch (To/From NZ) - My recommendation is Air New Zealand. I recently booked this and spent 25k Krisflyer (Singapore) for a RT flight on Air New Zealand. I definitely consider that tremendous value, though discount carriers operate these routes and you can find deals (I would consider $300 round trip in economy to be a good deal).

###Sydney-Specific
Rule of thumb, if you have 5+ days in the region than I suggest going outside of Sydney. It's a cool city, but there is SO much more to see. Scroll down for details, but while in Sydney here are a few suggestions:

* Taronga Zoo – One of my favourites. A great place to see all the local animals that the US doesn’t have. **This is a FANTASTIC first day activity and will help you fight jet lag!**
* Bondi to Cogee Walk – A beautiful self-guided walk down the coast. It’s just a walking path but it's a must do. 
* Harbour Bridge Climb – Climb atop Sydney’s most famous bridge to see the city like nowhere else. Younger people love it, older people tend to avoid it. I haven't done it and don't plan to. 
* Sydney Opera House – The most famous landmark in Sydney. We could see a show or just do a tour. Up to you.
* Manly Ferry/Beach – Manly beach is amazing and the surrounding area is filled with bars and restaurants. This would take up the majority of a day. The ferry there and back is a mini sightseeing tour in and of itself.
* Sydney Bus Tours - Highly recommended as it takes you all over the city and even out to Bondi. Hop on/Hop off style so you can wander if you like a stop.
* Sydney Boat Tours – Just like the bus tours, the boat tours allow you to get off at stops and explore. A great way to maneuver around the water and hit the main points of interest. Could be a good way to see Manly, too. Do NOT do a dinner cruise, the food is bad and it's just a waste of time. 
* The Rocks – Located right in the harbour, the Rocks is an area with numerous restaurants, a famous market and Australia’s oldest pubs.
* Darling Harbour – Like the Rocks, DH is another touristy area on the water that has a ton of restaurants and bars. Also has a Ferris wheel, an enormous fish market with tons of fresh seafood, and a casino.
* Sydney Seaplanes – Name says it all. I absolutely LOVED the ""Sydney Secrets"" tour. 
* Featherdale Wildlife Park – Never been here but it comes highly recommended. Basically it is an animal park where all of the animals are loose and you can interact with them. All of the Australian animals will be there. It is a little bit of a drive but definitely doable.
* Blue Mountains – A national park that has a bunch of beautiful views and is much different from the water you get all around the city. They have a similar bus tour to all the attractions which lets you hop on/off at will. A train will take us directly up there if you’d like to go.
* Hunter Valley – Australia is known for its wine and HV is the closest region to the city.
  
**Places to Stay**
  
* Park Hyatt Syndey - go to place for best of the best stays. On Cirqular Quay with views of Opera House. 
* Westin Sydney - downtown, good location (10 min walk from quay), nice hotel. 
* Hilton Sydney - downtown, same as Westin. 
* Intercontinental Double Bay - ritzy area of town, looks to be a nice hotel. I live nearby so I'm biased - it's a good spot but out of the hustle and bustle. 
* Marriott - also downtown, 5 min from quay. Lobby recently redone, rooms are supposedly very nice, too. 
* Four Points Sydney - closer to Chinatown but still downtown. 20 min qay to quay. I've heard it's nice.
* There are tons more, this is a whole topic in an of itself.

###Regional
**Are you outdoorsy?**  
 
* Queenstown, NZ (~3 hour flight) - The end all be all go-to place for being outdoors. If you like being outside/hiking/etc. this should absolutely be on your list See extreme activities section.
* Tasmania - 
* Blue Mountains - see above. 
* Royal National Park (~30 min from Sydney) - great national park with some beautiful hiking spots. Not huge, but easy to get to and is a good excursion.

**Do you like food/drinks?**   

* Melbourne (pronounced Melbun) - Where to begin? Really the best way of thinking about Sydney vs. Melbourne, which is a HUGE rivalry by the way, is to put it simply as > Sydney has the sights whereas Melbourne has the culture. 

**Extreme activities?**   

* Cairnes (pronounced Cans) - the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. Backpacker town (if you want a nicer area near the GBR see Port Douglas) and full of bars and nightlife. If you're younger, want to hang out with some peers, and go diving, go here. 
* Queenstown - the extreme sports capital of the world or something like that. Has it all - skiing, skydiving, bungee jumping, rafting, etc. 

**Animals**
  
* Featherdale Wildlife Park - Near Sydney, see above section. 
* Taronga Zoo - see Sydney section.
* Austrlaia Zoo - Up near Sunshine Coast, not familiar with it. 
  
**Cultural**  
  
* Melbourne - see food.   
* Uluru - Where Ayers Rock is. Great for the ""Outback"" experience. Can fly (3 hrs) from Sydney, not/nothing else there though. 
  
**Beaches/Relaxation**  
  
* Lord Howe Island - limited access island. Super exclusive. Best value is booking out and using Qantas points to get there. 16k or so round trip for $1,000 flight.   
* Hamilton Island - right off barrier reef's southern end. Beautiful islands with Whitsundays islands nearby.  
* Port Douglas - the nicer way to get to the Great Barrier Reef (as opposed to touristy/backpacker Cairns).  
* Bondi/Bronte/Coogee/etc. - Eastern beaches. All near Syndey. Bondi to Coogee walk will show you most of them.  
* Northern Beaches (30 - 45 min car ride from city). More laid back beaches outside of the city. Slower paces, friendlier locals. 

##Example Itinerary##
Assumes 10 days down under.
  
* Day 1 - Land in SYD, drop bags at hotel, change, and head straight to Zoo. DO NOT NAP. Try to stay awake until 7p or so. Good luck.
* Day 2 Sydney - Hop on/Hop off bus tour. Do Bondi to Coogee walk when you get to Bondi. Figure out what you like and don't like along the way.
* Day 3 Travel to Melbourne - Dinner downtown. 
* Day 4 Melbourne - Coffee, walk around CBD, Great Ocean Road maybe?
* Day 5 Travel to Queenstown, NZ
* Day 6 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 7 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 8 Travel to Sydney 
* Day 9 Sydney - Opera House tour. Ferry to Manly for lunch/afternoon. 
* Day 10 Depart Sydney

AA Platinum - 50k

Delta (no status) - 4k  
Marriott Gold - 54k  
Hilton Gold - 15k  
Chase UR - 195k  

&nbsp;

AirFrance has limited availability for my dates so it seems I am limited to the following 2 options due to lack of transfer partners.

&nbsp;

Option 1:  
Book directly with AA for 2,821.12 USD using my AA Citi Exec Card or CSP (need to hit spending req on new card)

&nbsp;

Option 2:  
Book with Chase UR for 173,274 points

&nbsp;

Which would you guys recommend for making the most out of miles/points? Is it a waste to not transfer those Chase UR points and burn them directly through their portal? We have the cash to buy the tickets outright, just figured it might be nice to save money."

I'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions before I make the transfer. Thanks in advance.

Edit -- In case anyone is interested, there seems to be good availability on this route. I searched April 2019 and found a lot of dates that worked. "
54,Korean Air: Not that hard,23,598o4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/598o4x/korean_air_not_that_hard/,34,2016-10-25 06:22:49,"Some background. I just got into this point game last month when I applied for the Chase Reserve with the sole purpose of getting my family of 4 to Hawaii. I quickly started researching the Korean Air option at 25k per person RT. I went ahead and created my family Skypass account and used last years tax return for proof of relationships, easy peezy..seriously took 10 minutes out of my work day. I have been looking at alaskair.com for the last few weeks just trying to determine when a good time for us to go to HI would be and I settled on 21-27 Apr and easily found some flights on Delta: Route Summary: PHX-LAX-HNL 8hr total fly time works for me. Anywho, made the call to Korean Air this afternoon and let them know what dates I was looking for and was told to expect a call back within 24 hours. About 6 hours later I received a call from the same number I had earlier called and it was a Skypass rep. to complete the booking. A few minutes into the call he did have some computer issues, asked if he could call me back shortly and I agreed. 15 minutes later he called and after about 7 minutes on the phone my 4 tickets heading to HI are essentially booked. From here I sent in our photo IDs and birth certificates for my 2 children. Now it is just a matter of confirming everything and then transferring my 100k UR points when it comes time to ticketing.
Seriously at first reading the blogs did make it seem intimidating, especially since we usually can do everything behind our computer screen without talking to someone. All in all though I just wanted to say to someone that is a newb like me, don't be afraid of the Korean Air process, it works."
55,Trip Report: Singapore and Malaysia,17,940447,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/940447/trip_report_singapore_and_malaysia/,34,2018-08-02 19:12:56,"Trip Report:
2 week Honeymoon in Singapore and Malaysia for wife and I

* ORD -> ICN (Seoul) -> SIN, J (Business) Class with Korean Air.  75K UR transferred to Korean Air per person plus $100 taxes each.  Our first 'lay-flat' experience and it was very nice.  Nice lounge in ICN.

* 3 nights at JW Marriot Singapore South Beach.  40K Marriott points per night.  Room was a bit small but was a lovely hotel.  Great breakfast spread in the lounge for us gold members.  Nice location.  We enjoyed touring Singapore.

* SIN -> BKI (Kota Kinabalu), Economy with Silk Air.  7500 miles each, MR transferred to Krisflyer.  Standard economy flight.  Miles beat cash for this intra-Asia flight, we wanted direct.

* 1 night at Le Meridien Kota Kinabalu.  8500 Starpoints for exec room.  Great location but currently undergoing much needed renovation, still probably one of the better accommodations in KK.  They did the rose petals and everything for our Honeymoon and the incredible personal service we had is probably the best I've had in my life at a non-luxury hotel.  The night market (Filipino style) right outside is a unique experience, super cheap awesome seafood.  

* 2 day 1 night hike of Mount Kinabalu with Via Ferrata coming down.  Probably the most surreal and thrilling experiences of my life.  Exhausting as well, more difficult than any of the six 14ers I've hiked in Colorado by far.  The Via Ferrata is the highest in the world and truly epic.  The Pendant Hut lodge is basic but what do you expect on a mountain?  This was booked with cash via River Junkie, all-inclusive.  Not cheap but so worth it for the experience.

* Another night at Le Meridien Kota Kinabalu, 8500 Starpoints for exec room.  Same great service and even rushed laundry service for us.  We were exhausted so just relaxed and enjoyed the free evening food/drinks and breakfast in the AM.

* BKI -> TWU (Tawau) booked via Malaysia Airlines with cash.  Cheap, standard ecomony flight.

* 4 nights at Scuba Junkie, Mabul Resort.  Paid cash, all-inclusive style on small island.  Accommodation is not luxurious but certainly adequate for the situation.  We got our PADI Advanced Open Water and dived at Sipadan Island, one of the best scuba locations in the world, apparently.  Great experience and would definitely stay and dive there again.  Sipadan is a special place.

* TWU -> KUL -> LGK (Langkawi).   Economy with Air Asia, cash.  No hitches.

* 3 nights at Ritz-Carlton Langkawi in Grand Oceanfront Villa.  228K UR points using CSR for 1.5 cpp.  Beautiful property and superb room and experience.  The most luxurious and splendid room I've ever stayed in.  We did the classic honeymoon stuff: spa, private pool, dinners, etc.  We did see a bit of the island, but we didn't really want to leave the room.  It's a big chunk of UR, but we indulged for our honeymoon.  

* LGK -> KUL -> SIN.  Economy with Malaysia Airlines.  First flight was delayed but we we able to make connection for our intercontinental flight.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy the lounges on this stretch due to timing and lounge location.  They lost one of our bags, which had to get routed to ORD about 4 days after we returned state-side.  Really the only hitch of the trip.

* SIN -> PVG (Shanghai) -> ORD.  J (Business) class with China Eastern.  95K MR each, transferred to Delta.  $225 taxes each, plus $100 MR transfer fee, which caught me off-guard.  Another awesome J experience, on par the with Korean Airlines flights.  Killer 2 story lounge at PVG with showers, recliners, massage chairs, that came in handy for the 7 hour layover.  

Overall, points-wise, this cost us:

378K Chase UR

190K Amex MR

120K Marriott Rewards Points

17K Starpoints

It was an amazing, once in a lifetime trip and all went according to plan.  Back to the real world, now.  

P2 and I have been moderately churning CCs for about 2 years now.  CIP x 2 (with referrals) and CSR x 2 were the big ones that got us the UR.  Biz Plat x 1 and Personal Plat x 1 were the major MR earners.  We still have loads of MR left, but time to up the points for another amazing trip!

Feel free to reply or PM for any specific questions or more details.

I can fly from the Bay Area (SFO, OAK) or Detroit (DTW) or even the DC area (BWI, IAD, DCA) because I could chain the trip with some holiday visits to family in those places. I only need to use the miles/points for the US>Nepal trip. I can pay for any domestic positioning flights if needed.

59,South Africa 2020,13,bel3bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bel3bd/south_africa_2020/,33,2019-04-18 16:42:42,"Looking to do a trip with the girlfriend and me to South Africa in 2020. We would like to split out time between Cape Town (3-4 nights) and on a Safari (3 or 4 nights). From what I have read, April would be a good time to go. We'd fly out of Chicago, so that gives us lots of options. Both of us are flooded with AA, Delta, UR and got a good amount of other points (200k MR (will earn more as the year goes on), 60k Avianca, 25k United)

My initial plan is fly QR there and back (or possibly EY Apartments one way). I know I can't book April yet, but my plan is to book it as soon as it's available. Our dates in April are 100% flexible.

1) I have found lots of availability for ORD-DOH-JNB in March, but can never find ORD-DOH-CPT. Does QR not fly direct from DOH to CPT?

2) If we have to fly in/out of JNB, is it better to just pay cash for flights from JNB to CPT?

3) Ideally, we'd like to not have to go back to JNB after CPT, what would be another good option to go from CPT back to ORD?

4) I know Safari lodges are hard on points. Any recommendations of places to stay using Marriott/Hilton points by Kruger? If we did that, can we just pay a company to pick us up/meet them and they do day drives in Kruger?

5) If we go non-Marriott/Hilton for Kruger, can anyone recommend some good places on the UR portal inside the park? Ideally all-inclusive with game drives.

6) Any other recommendations for Safaris/South Africa in general?"

61,Planning a honeymoon,7,7x39er,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7x39er/planning_a_honeymoon/,32,2018-02-12 22:26:16,"This is my first post, so I apologize in advance if this is a redundant subject! 

As the title states, I’ll be planning a honeymoon sometime in mid-2019. I’m looking to plan a RTW trip or a trip to Bali or the Maldives. We’d like to fly a top product in first or business class as much as possible on the longer legs. I’d expect all of these accounts to go up ~30k during that time, with the possibility of another sign-up bonus for Chase or Amex. I’d love some help getting some realistic (or aspirational) redemptions for the perfect honeymoon.

Note: I realize none of this is currently bookable, but would like to start gathering ideas and figuring out possibilities. Below is some information to help get started. Thanks in advance for the help! Looking forward to becoming more involved in the community. 


Current balances:
-AAdvantage: 250k
-Delta skymiles: 20k
-Chase UR: 145k
-Amex MR: 125k


Departure airport: ATL, CLT, or LHR

I live in Southern California, and John Wayne Airport is the closest option for me.  I do fly LAX but only when I need to.  Since JWA isn't a major hub, I tend to fly different airlines.  I have 40-80k points on United, American, and Delta (each) and I don't think at this rate I'll ever get upgraded to first class or get free flights if I'm not doing things correctly.  I also have 60k points with Marriott.

I know I'm not traveling a ton, but I do go on 2-3 trips per month, so I figure that's enough that could add up.  

Can I convert points from one airline or hotel to another?

I'm thinking of consolidating and trying my best to only fly American.  Is this a good idea?

How do I make sure to maximize my benefits in the future?  Can I earn airline miles from my hotel stays and rental cars?  

My ultimate goal would be to get free airline tickets for my family.  If I can get upgraded seats during business travel, I wouldn't object - but the priority is getting free tickets for my wife and kids."

My husband and I have been saving miles for the past couple of years by using their MM credit card and other rewards points, the idea being to use them on booking our honeymoon. We currently have 110,00 miles, and FRA is our home airport, so Lufthansa's Miles and More seemed the way to go. We've finally got a chunk of time that we could use for a vacay, and we went to look at the flights,  with a destination of LAX in Aug/Sept.   

This is where our trouble began. LH wants 30,000 M + **490EUR pP ""Fees & Taxes""** for an economy flight. No business class available. 

This far out, I can book a flight with Delta for the same dates, cheaper and not using any miles. Or plenty of other airlines for comparable $$$ without using miles.   

We both feel like we have a bunch of useless miles that won't really take us anywhere without us having to spending cash that would be comparable to a fare and we're spending money for their upkeep by keeping their stupid MM credit card. Did we get bamboozled? Or is MM just shitty?"

**Learnings**

* Get your miles ASAP. I had been looking for HNL - SYD flights in J and I was contemplating splitting up people into different flights or fare class. One hazy night, I found 6 in J on the same flight. I booked it immediately, because I knew it was a unicorn. If I didn't have 390k AA in an account, one could've been snatched from me. Another example was that the [Australian call center](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-airlines-aadvantage/1738929-booking-aa-award-travel-etihad-ey-master-thread-july-2017-onwards.html) trick had ""closed"", meaning I thought I had another 4 months to accumulate miles. Welp, the loophole opened back up the next week and I had to scramble to do in a week what I thought I had 4 months to do.

* Do you research on how many premium award seats will get released. AUH to ORD on EY only has award J availability for 2. If you're waiting to get 6 seats, that's not going to happen. I got dinged for changing my destination to JFK.

* Keep some mystery on the things you're excited for. I had read too many trip reports on the Etihad First Class Apartment, I watched every YouTube video on it & interviewed people about their experience...so I knew every exact detail and set my expectations way too high that they'd never be met. I enjoyed it, but would've enjoyed it much more had there been mystery around it.

* I tried to avoid YQ like the plague, so that's why I chose some of the flights that I did. Probably should've been less of a miser there, but I think it worked out really well.

I made dreams come true & got a commemorative mug for it. Could I have used my miles more efficiently? Probably, but (KanyeShrug).

P.S. Obligatory thanks for the help, internet!

**Update 1**

**Tools I used**

* 7 or 8 months in advance, I would first look on Kayak to find routes & times that would be convenient.

* Then after I picked the top 3 routes & times, I would study the most efficient way to fly that route. Would it make sense to transfer points into that program or use a partner? Does one have YQ and the other not?

* From there, ExpertFlyer was incredibly helpful for looking for award availability. I started booking 6 months in advance. It gets easier once you get away from the US.

* I pretty much have this as my wallpaper [WellTraveledMile transferable points chart](https://welltraveledmile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Airline_Transfer_Partner_Guide_Airlines_Update_dec16.png)

* I am also part of meetups, FB groups, Slack channels, browse Reddit, went to FTU, read blogs and occasionally look at FT. People are REALLY helpful if you have an EXACT question. People hate it when you don't think for yourself & have to spoonfeed you answers.

**Taxes & Fees**

* (MSP - HNL) - DL Economy Comfort - $0 (booked via UR portal)*6 = $0

* (SEA - HNL) - DL J - $21.60

* (SYD - OOL) - 3 QF J & 3 QF Y - $15.90*6 = $95.40

* (OOL - SYD) - VA Y - $0 (booked via UR portal)*6 = $0

* (SYD - AUH) - 2 EY F & 4 EY J - $74.60*2 + $74.70*4 = $448

* (AUH - JFK) - 6 EY J - $49.16*6 = $294.96

**Total in fees for flights paid:** $1,042.36

**Total retail value of flights:** $89,174

**Total retail value of hotels:** $7,379 + $1,278 (paid in cash) = $8,657

70,To F or J on ANA? That is the question... Pics and review of IAH-NRT route,52,89vty8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/89vty8/to_f_or_j_on_ana_that_is_the_question_pics_and/,30,2018-04-05 06:03:22,"Bit of a backstory here: I never really intended to fly ANA F, but since I was prepping to close my Citi Premier card, I had to dump my TYP somewhere. As fortune would have it there was a 25% transfer bonus from Citi -> VS at the time and it left me with enough points to book F when normally I’d have just booked J. So I figured why not let’s compare the 2 cabins. This turned out to be a good thing since I wound up having to change the dates of the trip in January and when I went to rebook it only about 60 days in advance, there was zero J in sight on my route, limited F, but it was there for peak cherry blossom season.

All pictures and viewpoints are from the 777-300 and the IAH-NRT route. All window seats since I was traveling solo.

Here is the IMGUR album link, so follow along, I’ve posted the pics in the same order as the text. It would be a lot more user friendly if reddit would allow in line posting of images, but what can you do… Unless otherwise noted, F pics are on the left, J pics are on the right.

https://imgur.com/a/RvPu6


**Check in and departure at Houston** (no pics)

Sorry to combine this, but they’re the same in either class. While there is 1 dedicated F and 2 J check in counters, all were occupied when I arrived. Either way the wait was minimal and handled quickly, much like last year. ANA uses the United Club as their lounge which is unfortunate for many reasons, mainly because it isn’t very good. Until the IAH Polaris Lounge is ready, the Centurion Lounge remains the best lounge at IAH if you have a qualifying Amex card. I went to the UC to check it out since I had the time, but quickly left. The breakfast spread was weak and the lounge crowded. The CL has infinitely better food and better drinks. Not to mention it’s closer to gate D5, which is the one ANA uses at IAH. Even once the Polaris Lounge opens, I wouldn’t expect there to be any difference for ANA F vs. J since United is phasing out their own F cabin and Global First lounges.

**Check in and departure at Tokyo** (no pics)

The differences here are that F pax are allowed to use the Suites check in which is under the Z letter at NRT Terminal A. Biz pax have their own dedicated lanes in the normal area. F pax have a dedicated security checkpoint (I was the only person in it), while Biz have access to the Gold Track lane. Neither class has access to a dedicated immigration checkpoint, which IMO would have been more useful than a dedicated security checkpoint.

With an F BP, you get to use the ANA Suites lounge vs the biz class side. They are two sides to the same general area (walk in and take a left to go to biz, take a right to go to suites), the main differences being the Suites lounge is far less crowded and has a self serve buffet of hot food, which the biz doesn’t. One review of the Suites lounge I found online said it would be “a fantastic business class lounge” which is a pretty fair summary since it lacks many of the traits of other top tier lounges, like table service for meals, spa amenities, etc. that you’d find in CX, EK lounges. Hell even AA now has table service Flagship First dining in LAX and JFK. (There are some pictures of the ANA Suites lounge below in the ANA vs JAL comparison I link to)

**The seat**

So first vs biz has long been summed up as seat and service are the real differences. So let’s address the seat. My thoughts: it’s very comfortable, it’s cloth, and while it’s wide, it isn’t anywhere near a crazy width (ala Cathay F), and the seat width is cannibalized by the 5ish inch arm rests on both sides of the seat. See the pic where I used Amex cards for a comparison! Now I’m not a big guy so I don’t terribly care, I fit just fine, I mention it because it got some discussion in the recent ANA J vs F comparison. I didn’t notice much of a difference in seat position vs J in width, but I did in comfort. The ANA F seat is like that comfy recliner you’d had for years, which kind of makes sense, this recliner has been flying around for about 5-6 years. Now this compares with Cathay F, which on the 777 has an absurd seat/bed width. But they also only do 3 across on their 777 in F. 

It’s worth mentioning that getting in and out of the F seat is easier because your pathway is about twice as wide as J.

**The bed**

This probably the biggest hard product advantages of F. As you can see the bed goes fully flat and the bed goes flush with the armrests which take up lot of the space in seated position. Also the footwell is much larger. The ANA I don’t really recall any difference in the quality of the sleep between J and F. As is usual with Asian airlines they kept the temperature a bit warmer than I’d prefer so I barely used the blanket and just had the pyjamas on. The PJs are also way better in F vs the ones I was given in J last year. They’re a lot more comfortable and fit better.

**Dining**

I’m not going to talk too much about this – you can see the pictures. As the prior ANA comparison mentioned, there isn’t much of a difference between F and J as far as the menu goes, besides an extra appetizer course. The main difference is in the alcohol quality, Krug and Hibiki 21 in F, something lesser and Hibiki 17 in J. ANA’s catering is excellent in both cabins and I haven’t had anything disappointing in my 4 flights with them. Both cabins more or less share the same order on demand snack menu. 

You can view the menu for my flight, and any other ANA flight here: https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/serviceinfo/international/inflight/guide/f/meal/ scroll down and pick your departure city.

**Random musings**

IFE – I felt that the IFE selections were kind of lacking for US/western tastes. Unless you like Star Wars, they had a shit ton of those movies available. 

Service – I can’t say I’ve had a negative interaction with any ANA employee yet. They take great care of you, and at least appear to really enjoy their jobs! Their attention to detail is amazing though. On my return flight, one of the FAs who wasn’t the one who served me dinner, was wondering around with a different bottle of red wine from what I originally had. She already knew it wasn’t the one I had ordered, and encouraged me to try a glass of the other red. Part of me wondered if they somehow knew I liked to compare beverages since I had asked for a Hibiki 21 vs 17 comparison on the outbound flight. Also each time you ring the call button, they appear out from behind the curtains in only a few seconds. 


**Overall conclusions**

As far as booking, I can really only recommend F > J as long as the VS award chart lasts, and personally I think it’s ripe for getting “enhanced” away. I don’t think there’s a single better value out there for true international first class, and when you think that Citi and Amex occasionally have transfer bonuses to further reduce the cost, I just think it’s too good to last. If you intend to take advantage I’d plan to do it sooner rather than later. The cost differential using United miles (220k r/t in F vs 160k in J) or ANA’s program (150k r/t F vs 75-90k J) is way too big to be worthwhile. Personally I’m not even sure I’d book F instead of J via VS unless there was a transfer bonus that allowed you to basically pay for J and get F. 

So where do these products rank for me? While ANA has an undoubtedly solid F product, it’s not the best I’ve flown. The ground service and lounge amenities are somewhat lacking, the hard product is a bit dated, I think this F cabin is unchanged since it came out at least 5-6 years ago. A friend flew ANA F from Japan to NYC from this same trip, he hadn’t flown it since 2013, and said nothing’s changed. Finally, while not an issue for me since I’m forever single, it’s not an ideal product for couples. What it makes up for is trademark fantastic Japanese service and excellent crew, very good food and booze, and a comfy seat and bed.

Personally I don’t think there would be anywhere as much hype about ANA F if it weren’t for the really good value of booking through VS, and the fact that Japan is an awesome place to visit. I’m not trying to belittle ANA F, it’s just that I think the largest failing ANA F is only incrementally better than J. The meals are mostly the same, both cabins have all aisle 1-2-1 access, and the ground experience is almost the same. 

Emirates still takes the #1 spot for me, Cathay follows at #2, and ANA now at #3. But let’s talk J products. ANA is 1st in my long-haul J ranking, followed by Virgin Australia in #2, Delta’s A350 in #3, AA at #4, and Thai in a distant #5. 

Up on the travel docket for the rest of the year as far as new products go, assuming no changes, are QF J, TG F, CX J, and JL J, all in one wacky trip. Of those I’m most excited for TG F on the 747 and JL J. 

**Another resource to look at ANA F**

I didn’t write this comparison, but a user on Flyertalk posted this comprehensive comparison of ANA F vs JAL F. I haven’t yet flown JAL F, so I personally can’t attest to the conclusions, but I don’t disagree with any of his opinions about ANA. https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trip-reports/1857800-comparing-jal-ana-first-class-better.html


**NRT vs HND**

I see lots of people online talk up the superiorness of HND because it’s closer. On this trip I finally had a chance to use HND for a domestic flight (ANA Y, which I haven’t covered here, if you have any questions feel free to ask away).

Fun fact about domestic flights in Japan, there are no liquids restrictions, so you can carry your water bottle through security. Beer would probably be cool too, given Japan’s lack of laws prohibiting open containers of alcohol. 

Ok yeah it’s closer to downtown, but damn does the monorail get crowded around rush hour time, and you’re still probably going to need to transfer from the monorail or the Keisei line to another subway or JR line to get your destination. I still like the NEX train because you’re guaranteed a seat, which isn’t necessarily true on either transit line to HND, there is free and fairly fast WIFI, and if you are staying in the main areas of Tokyo like Shinjuku or around Tokyo Station, you don’t have to transfer lines.

Question for those in the know: 

Which is the better option for top tier? AA or Delta? 

The things that matter to me (and maybe others) most are: (1) Service: Starting from booking right through to the gate and on the flight. (2) Ability to use upgrades earned for at least ‘J’ flights on descent aircraft. (3) On-time departures and arrivals.

Thank you so much for your feedback!

(Also want to mention that we wouldn’t be guaranteed a suite, we’d be on the waiting list). We decided to go “premium economy” round trip, as they only require one upgrade.

But now I’m regretting that decision. We’re traveling the first two weeks of December which is a low travel time as most people wait until Christmas or New Years. I’m wondering if we should try for the suite on the way there, and hope the plane is so empty on the way back we can get a row to ourselves in economy. The plane currently looks pretty empty.

I travel really poorly, I’m really only able to sleep in the Delta One beds. I don’t want to get to Seoul so jet lagged I have to spend an entire day getting over it. But the thought of spending 15 hours in economy seat sounds just miserable. But would “premium economy” really be any better?

Cayman Pirates Week, Grand Cayman: mid November

&#x200B;

So I can't just travel the whole year, but there are some distinct trips that I feel like I could build with this agenda.  I'm thinking:

&#x200B;

**Trip 1**

January 19ish: fly to Melbourne and go to the Australian Open.  One of my bucket list items is to attend all 4 tennis grand slams...so far I've done the US and the French.  If I'm going to Australia in January anyway, this seems like a no brainer.  I've been to Australia before but only Sydney and Cairns.

January 25: fly over to Port Lincoln and attend the tuna throwing festival

January 27: Fly to New Zealand.  I've never been and it's high on my list.

February 7ish: Fly to Sapporo and attend the closing couple days of the snow festival.  Maybe I could spend a few more days in Japan...not sure where else I'd go in Winter.  I've been to Tokyo and Kyoto before.  EDIT: Now thinking of dropping this out of the trip and heading straight from New Zealand to Rome.

February 11ish: Fly to Rome, which I've been to before but it's been 20 years.  Head down to southern Italy which I've never been to before.

February 21ish: Head up to Ivrea which is near Turin and attend the Battle of the Oranges.

February 26ish (or maybe I spend a bit more time in Europe): Fly home to Chicago.

March 7th: Attend Chiditarod.

&#x200B;

**Trip 2**

Mid May: Fly to Europe.  Hit up some places I'd like to go: Switzerland (never been), Paris (would love to go back to the French Open), Venice (never been).  Then go to the Calcio Storico in Florence for the semifinals in early-ish June (dates TBA).  Then on to a group stage Euros match

Mid June: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

**Trip 3**

EDIT: Now thinking of flying to Tokyo in early August for the Olympics then heading to Edinborough for the Fringe Festival before proceeding on to Spain.

August 23ish: Fly to Spain.  Work my way over to Bunol for La Tomatina on the 26th.  Then head North and potentially explore non-Paris France (never been), Belgium (never been), the Netherlands (I've been to Amsterdam 20 years ago).

Late September: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

The rest of the events at the end of the year are straightforward flights in/out within North America/Caribbean.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking that I will want to use miles for:

USA to Australia (business)

New Zealand to Japan (business)

Japan to Italy (business)

Italy to USA (economy)

USA to Europe in May (business)

Europe to USA in June (economy)

USA to Europe in August (business)

Europe to USA in September (economy)

&#x200B;

Everything else I think I could just pay cash.

&#x200B;

So of course all these dates are too far out to check for award availability.  But I'd like to talk through my options and what is likely to be available to see if I can pull this off or if I need to make adjustments.  Here's my miles/points stash:

Amex: 95K

Merrill Lynch: 28K

Alaska: 137K (will soon get add'l 40K bonus)

American Airlines: 124K

BA: 6.5K

Delta: 35K

Southwest: 36K

United: 43K (though I suspect I'll need to use 30K for travel in May 2019)

Choice: 8K

Hilton: 47K

Hyatt: 57K

IHG: 20K

Radisson: 119K

Wyndham: 20K

&#x200B;

I've done a little bit of proof of concept award travel search seeing if I could find the awards I need if I was doing this trip in 2019 instead of 2020.  I had success with everything except how to get to Australia with business class.  Of course I am searching just a month and a half out for Australia so that may be why there's no availability.  Here was my tentative plan for paying for this stuff with points.

&#x200B;

USA to Australia (business): I'm not sure how to crack this one because business class award availability to Australia is so tough.  Using Alaska miles to fly Cathay through Hong Kong seems like the most likely option?  If I ended up having a stopover for a couple of days in Hong Kong that would be totally cool as I've never been there before.  I really don't know if availability will be there for January 2020 if I start searching in February 2020.  Unfortunately, this is when I am least flexible in terms of timing: January is my busiest work time of year.  I'm going to work like the dickens the first 2 weeks of January 2020 to put as much to bed as possible but I really can't leave the USA in those first 2 weeks.

New Zealand to Japan (business): Looks like I can do this for just 40K AA miles.  There's availability for this in 2019 on Malaysian Air so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Japan to Italy (business): Can do this for 75K AA miles. There's availability for this in 2019 on BA so I'd hope there'd be availability in 2020.  I was worried the YQ surcharges would be really bad but it's only $200.

Italy to USA (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in May (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in June (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in August (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in September (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

&#x200B;

So I need 95K more Amex points but I figure I can find a way to make that happen.

&#x200B;

**My Questions**

1. Are there any great festivals I'm missing?  I considered Carnivale in Brazil or Mardi Gras in New Orleans, but I'm really just not sure the former is for me, and in any case this Battle of the Oranges seemed too cool to miss.  Though maybe I'm doubling up on that sort of thing if I'm going to La Tomatina.  I've been to Oktoberfest or that would be on the list for sure.  I suppose I could still go back during my Aug/Sep Europe trip.
2. Is there a better way to spend award points to make this trip come together?  Or credit cards I can get to get some points I need to do this better?  I'm way over 5/24.
3. Getting to Australia especially: I'm really concerned that I won't find availability on Cathay with Alaska miles in the tight window I will be looking and then I'm screwed.  Ideas?

&#x200B;

I appreciate everybody's help and sorry for such a long post.

I’ll be at the airport by around 7 that evening (so within the 3 hour window), so I will have time. I also have TSA Pre-Check.

With all that said, is it worth it to try to get to the Centurion lounge for a bit? Or should I just stick to the Delta lounge since I have access to that? If it is worth it to get to Centurion, how much time should I give myself to my gate in Terminal 1 (Delta)? Thanks!"

I need some advice on what airline and product will be able to: Provide a great first class product (lie flat, good service, food etc), allow me to book two award tickets together, have lower level awards available June 2018, a free stopover would be nice but not necessary. I have considered Delta One, Aeroflot, Singapore from Houston, and more. I'm just not sure where to look any further. 

I currently have the following Miles/Points:

- Delta Skymiles: 100k (delta Amex platinum card)
- Chase UR: 205K (Sapphire reserve, downgraded preferred to freedom)
- Hilton: 100k (two no fee Hilton cards Amex and visa)

Point balance: 50k Chase UR (will be a little more once my statement post)

Home airport: LAX

Destination: FAI

Cabin Class: Economy

Traveler: Just me.

Delta: I found a flight with Delta for around $616. Flight DL 2596, 2593 from LAX to FAI and DL 2710, 738 from FAI to LAX. Delta said it'll cost around 73k miles for the flight.

Alaska Air: The total price with Alaska/Virgin is around $581. The flight numbers are Virgin 1797 and Alaska 103 from LAX to FAI and from FAI to LAX Alaska 128 and Virgin 1780. It'll cost 40k Alaska miles.

I was using awardhacker site and saw that you can book flight from LAX to FAI for 25k miles? Is that true? I was hoping to transfer my UR points to Korean Air and transfer it to Delta as they're both in Skyteam? This will be my first attempt at using points for award travelling. Any tips and help would greatly appreciated!"

Are there any good resources out there to optimize our trip so that we use the least amount of miles and hotel points to make this happen?

For the hotel as long as things don't change with the merger, we can swing Sheraton Maldives @ 19k per night, not sure if having the basic room would be worth it.

It's coming down to the wire for me to start booking my flights (330 days out is August 9th ish). 

My plan is go to a few cities in Asia. We would be gone for about a month, soon to be wife is a teacher so summers off. We'll be flying out of MSP but I am looking for J and F for the overseas flights. 

Initial plan was MSP-SFO-HKG-HAN-SIN-DPS-SIN-JFK(via FRA)-MSP. 


Here is what I have built out with Bali in the itinerary.

Leg | Airline | Class |Days in destination| Notes |
-------|-------|-----|-----|----
MSP-SFO | Delta | Y |0-1| I was just going to find something, doesn't really need to be special here.
SFO-HKG | CX | J |6| Haven't flown CX in 15 years, would like to try their J product (AA miles)
HKG-HAN | KA | Y |6| MR-->BA has the bonus transfer at the moment, 4500 per person
HAN-SIN | SQ | J |3| I have enough MR to just blow on J flights so... why not
SIN-DPS | SQ | Y | 6|MR-->Virgin America is cheaper than transferring direct to SQ
DPS-SIN | SQ | Y | 0-1|I want to go back to SIN to fly Suites and experience the Private Room
SIN-FRA-JFK | SQ | Suites |Layover| Suites was my ultimate goal with churning so to have this opportunity, it's surreal. Just hope I can get the spots. 
JFK-MSP | Delta | Y |0| I'll find our way home somehow


Alternative plan: MSP-SFO/LAX/JFK-NRT/HND-HKG-HAN-SIN-JFK(via FRA)-MSP

Here is what it would look like with Japan in the itinerary.




Leg | Airline | Class | Days
---|-------|-----|----
MSP-SFO/JFK/LAX | Delta | Y | 0-1
SFO/JFK/LAX-NRT/HND | JAL | F | 6
NRT/HND-HKG | Haven't looked | Y or J | 6
HKG-HAN | KA | Y | 6
HAN-SIN | SQ | J | 3
SIN-JFK(via FRA) | SQ | Suites | Layover
JFK-MSP | Delta | Y | 0



Do I stick with Bali or swap Bali with Japan and move Japan as our first destination? Points aren't an issue, as my CX flight would be replaced with JAL (probably in First) since Japan is Asia 1 compared to HKG (Asia 2) for AA Partner flights.

Food is a huge selling point but relaxation with beaches is right up there.

Spent like 5 hours today trying to understand different stopover/open jaw policies and trying to figure out different regions, and having a lot of trouble and would prefer help. If you have the best route set up for us, I am willing to give you 3 months of gold :)



**Basic details:**


Departure city is either SFO or OAK.


**3 Destinations:**

Japan, Tokyo or Kyoto (10 days)

Seoul (3 days)

Maldives 10 days (OR Bangkok/Ko Phi Phi, but Maldives is significantly more preferred)


Japan and Seoul can be flipped, but would like last destination to be Maldives (or Thailand). We prefer it to be Maldives, but if you cannot make it work, then Thailand would be the alternative.


**Dates:**


Departing July 1st from SFO or OAK.
Departing Final City (maldives or thailand) for arrival ON July 24.


**Points available:**


**Me:**

* United: 20,000 (Gold member, so wider availability of awards)
* Delta: 40,000
* American: 150,000
* SPG: 73,000
* Chase UR: 235,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* AMEX MR: 145,000  (transferable to a lot of airlines)


**Wife:**

* United: 12,000
* American: 64,000
* SPG: 40,000
* Chase UR: 28,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* CapitalOne: 15,600
* Amex MR: 103,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)


How can we make this work? Could really use some guidance. 

Ideal parameters: maximize stopover rules, saver awards ONLY preferred (but if no availability, might have to suck it up), would prefer business class for Departing flight from SFO/OAK.

Any advice?? Thank you so much!

Another note, I have family in HKG and have been there multiple times (sorry, didn't mention earlier). We may not need more than 3 days in HKG. I would rather experience the new cultural experiences with her than to relive HKG while everything is brand new to her.

I apologize for bombarding this sub. I am constantly looking for ideas and reading everyone's experiences gets me all hyped up.

I think I have narrowed down my SE Asia Honeymoon in the summer of 2018. My plan is to take about 3-4 weeks depending on how my PTO pans out. Here is the tentative plan at the moment. Looking to spend about 3-5 days per location starting with HKG.

MSP - JFK - HKG - CNX - HAN or SGN - DPS - SYD or AKL or ZQN

This is a packed itinerary and still much in the blueprint process. 

As for points, here is what I have currently.



Program | My Points | Her Points
-------|---------|----------
UR | 135,835 | 167,456
MR | 160,071 | 0
SPG | ~40,000 | 0
AA | 167,872 | 0
Delta | 66,160 | 0
IHG | 36,610 | 0
Hyatt | 9,806 | ~10,000
Southwest | 78,780 | 0
Hilton | 80,816 | 0

My initial plan was to fly one way on J on CX from JFK - HKG with my AA miles (70k per person). But I have just started reading about ANA and their J class, along with the fact they offer stop overs? Correct me if I'm wrong. ANA also run about 80-90k in J ROUND TRIP which would be huge if we can get some sort of stopover in there as well. Would you use the MR or use AA based on product (CX vs ANA vs something else)? 

Any other advice on any certain airlines **OR  HOTELS** we should try and experience on this itinerary would be great! I also wanted to have this serve as a template for those who are thinking about SE Asia travel, not that there isn't enough, but the more the merrier!"

I want to fly from Zurich back to SFO so would I be allowed to purchase the RT ticket and simply not get on the return flight? Or allowed to cancel the return flight once I'm in Paris? Would they charge me the difference, or take away my Delta miles (it's a Delta flight)? Couldn't there hypothetically be some circumstances where I really wouldn't be able to take the flight back from Paris to SF, would Delta/Chase penalize?

Side note: the only nonstop flight from Zurich to SF is on United and $3,000 but only 45k miles + fees. Is that not crazy?!"

Right now I'm trying to piece together a surprise trip with a relative of mine to Japan. It's a dream destination for them, and I'm hoping to make at least one 'aspirational' redemption since they typically haven't experienced much beyond economy travel through-and-through, particularly for flights.

---

**Here's what I'm shooting for:**

* Get us ~10 days in Japan during Spring 2019, inclusive of flights and hotel, and preferably in and around Tokyo; this can include a stopover for a few nights on the way. Incorporating Kyoto is a plus but not mandatory.
* Preference for business or first class travel in one direction; no strong preference for the other (is it better to do this at the beginning or end of a trip?). Just want to give my relative the experience of a higher class of travel.
* Minimize cash spend, though I'm comfortable spending some towards hotels or flights if the added flexibility unlocks particularly good redemptions.
* Pretty flexible outside of these parameters.

---

**Here's the relevant points/miles at my disposal:**

**Transferrable:**

* UR: ~320K
* MR: ~300K
* TY: ~6K (earning another 10k in June)
* BofA Merrill+: ~50k

**Hotel:**

* Starpoints/Marriott: ~50k/150k (earning another ~20k/60k in June), plus a 7-night Cat 1-5 certificate (can upgrade for 30k per additional Category above 5)
* IHG: ~90k, plus one free night certificate available at the time of travel

**Airlines:**

* Asia Miles: ~70k (Earning another ~20k in June)
* Alaska: ~150k
* Delta: ~50k (Earning another ~70k in April)

---

Presently, I'm considering using my Alaska miles to grab Cathay Pacific Business (50k o/w) and/or First (70k o/w) tickets with a stopover in HK, and then using Delta miles for economy or premium economy flights in the other direction (shockingly, to me at least. I see readily available 35k/45k one-way economy/premium economy on Delta to travel between Boston and Tokyo). As for the hotel, I figure I can redeem 90k Marriott points with my 7-night certificate for a Category 8 hotel in Tokyo, and pair this with the IHG free night certificate and points to cover a few days in Hong Kong.

...This *seems* like a pretty efficient use of points to me, and certainly hits high cpp on paper, but I'm looking for advice mostly to make sure I'm not glossing over opportunities to enhance the trip further or realize solid value. I have little experience making these sorts of redemptions to date.

Thanks much!"

Southwest: 100k + Companion Pass

Airport: ORD/MDW

When: 11/22 - 11/29 (flexible around those dates)
What: 2x Biz/First class tickets
Where: Ideally somewhere warm with nice beaches, international (not Mexico). Wouldn't need really nice room unless it's mindblowing.

**EDIT** Should've mentioned I have 100k Southwest + Companion Pass. So that could maek Central America more enticing."

We received a few nicer things- meals, amenity kit on one leg, and a pillow for the flight. But the seat was a very basic economy seat and I was a little upset about that. The lady who was sat next to me on the flight to IST seemed so upset (speaking in French so I couldn’t understand everything) she left the plane!

I was just wondering if it would be worth my time to complain and try to get some miles back? Or just leave it be?

ETA- thanks for the helpful responses. I realize this was my fault for not researching more, but at least I know now. This was only one leg of a much longer business flight and I did make sure my 11 hour flight was a lay flat so at least I looked into one flight!

I usually fly about 70k butt-in-seat miles a year for work and maybe 10k or so for pleasure so requalifying for Plat with little to no rollover MQMs shouldn't be an issue.

But right now we are looking at summer vacation tickets to Europe. The one world Alliance tickets are extremely expensive at the moment. Perhaps they will drop, especially since the euro is doing poorly against the dollar, and of course the airlines are raking in record profits, but on the other hand they may not drop the prices if they can sell them for these exorbitant prices.

There are some other airlines which are a few hundred dollars cheaper to our destination, such as Icelandair and the Portuguese airline TAP. But they have some drawbacks in terms of the itinerary , and also we would be losing quite a few miles. Now the important thing about having miles for me is keeping my status, because I like having the free main cabin extra seats , as well as boarding first and all that other crap. I rarely used my miles for award tickets, although we have and it has saved us a lot of money. So I'm wondering whether should pay perhaps 200 or $300 more per ticket to fly with one world then with one of these non Alliance Airlines, like Delta or Swissair.

115,How to book AA/AS awards using Avios,12,3hjhsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3hjhsl/how_to_book_aaas_awards_using_avios/,25,2015-08-19 08:06:30,"
There are enough confusion about using Avios that it screams out for a quick guide.  Note, this is not a comprehensive guide on how to maximize your value, but only a short guide that describes how to search for awards, and use Avios to book travel.

Avios is the points program from British Airways.  You can earn Avios by flying on BA or their partner airlines, using the Chase BA credit card, or transfer points from UR, MR, or SPG.

What makes Avios really useful, is that it is a distance based program.  This means that the number of Avios you need for a trip is based on the flight distance.  Any non-stop trip shorter than 650 miles one way, will only cost 4500 Avios one way. This is a fantastic deal when compared to standard award cost of 12.5k miles from AA/AS/UA/DL.

One thing about Avios award, is that multi-stop awards are priced as multiple awards.  So a 1 stop connecting flight now cost you two awards, one for each leg traveled.  So when looking for Avios awards, you really want to stay with non-stop flights.

When flying inside US, you can use Avios to book AA and AS awards.  BA partners with AA as part of One World alliance, and partner with AS separately.  This means for AS and AA flights on their own metal, if there are Saver level awards, you can book them with Avios.

When searching for AA awards, you should first go to the BA website and create an Executive Club account.  Once you login, you can access BA's award search tool, and use it to find AA awards.  This works most of the time unless there is an IT glitch.  If you can find the AA award you want, you can book that directly with BA online, and The website will show you the number of Avios you need for the award.

However, BA.com does not show AS awards.  So if you want to include AS as an option, you have to use AA.com, which does show AS awards.  Now, when you search on AA.com, you will see that AA wants 12.5k AA miles for the award.  You can ignore this, as you are just using the website to search for the award.  Once you find the award seat you want, write down the date, time, and flight number, and CALL BA reservations.  Tell them you want to book an award flight on AS, and give them the info.  The CSR should be able to find and book the award for you, charging the correct Avios for the award.  Also, there should not be a phone booking fee, as this award cannot be booked online.

Note, you can also use alaskaair.com to search for AS awards, but you have to be careful.  AS would also show awards on flights operated by other partners, such as Delta, but you can't book those awards using Avios.  Using AA.com means any award is available to AS partners to book.

117,Hawaii Trip,1,7ihst6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7ihst6/hawaii_trip/,25,2017-12-08 23:38:31,"I know there are a lot of posts about Hawaii...so here’s another one!

My fiancé and I are getting married in April 2018. We're planning a delayed honeymoon - probably August - October timeframe. Our leading candidate for destination is Hawaii. I've spent the past few days researching all the different ways to get there with points. I have the following points: 260k UR, 130k MR, 40k United, 120k SW, 70k JetBlue, 140k Hilton, 130k Marriott, 80k SPG.

I realize that the cheapest way to get there with points is probably transferring to Korean Air. However, I think I want to book the tickets before we're actually married and I know they have restrictions on that. I know there are a few other cheap options (Air France, British Airways, etc.) but I would really like to fly at least one way in first class. It seems like the best first class going to Hawaii is on Hawaiian Airlines. If we're not flying first class, I would at least like a plane with 2-X-2 seating. I believe that leaves either a 767 or A330. All of Hawaiian's flights appear to be on an A330 with 2-4-2 seating. The only reasonable option I see for a 767 is Delta metal booked through Air France but the availability is a pretty iffy. Also, I'm thinking of using the UR points on hotels. It doesn't seem like MR points transfer as well to hotels.

This is the itinerary I came up with and points/cost for each leg.

* TPA > JFK on JetBlue (Coach for 7.3k or $119 per Person)

* JFK > HNL on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First 80k MR Points per Person)

* HNL > OGG on Hawaiian ($73 per Person - I will try to see if I can get the Amex Plat Reimbursement on these.)

* OGG > SFO on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First $567.33 per Person)

* SFO > FLL on JetBlue (Mint for 33.7k or $449 per Person)

* FLL > TPA on Southwest (8k or $134 per Person)

* $1,280.66 (for 2 People)


Am I being crazy with all of this? Should I just book round trip with Air France or British Airways and likely get stuck in a middle site for 5+ hours?"
118,Going to be doing a lot of NYC to Washington DC travel and looking to maximize points/gain status,11,abq1lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/abq1lc/going_to_be_doing_a_lot_of_nyc_to_washington_dc/,26,2019-01-02 07:53:54,"I'm going to be going back and forth from NYC to DC relatively frequently (maybe 4-6 flights a month? Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"

Armed with the CSR, I have always utilized the Chase Portal to book my trips. 

But recently becoming more literate, I have been made aware of the value of transferring points to other partners.

Using AwardHacker to find my best bets, [I plugged in a hypothetical itinerary](http://www.awardhacker.com/#f=JFK&t=PDX&o=0&c=j&s=0&p=0). I was seeking a nonstop Business Class flight from JFK to PDX. 

[Looking at the projected fares](https://i.vgy.me/aDI1JR.png), which I understand are just the best deals possible and not the actual fares that can be redeemed, it appears that my main option for redeeming UR is a set of Delta flights which can be redeemed by transferring points to FlyingBlue. 

But looking into Delta flights, I don't actually see any flights that match this description.

I'm sorry to ask a fairly basic question, but I could use some guidance in understand the optimal redemption method of my points. Any and all help and insight is appreciated."
122,Thinking of switching from Southwest to Delta,13,77w3nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/77w3nk/thinking_of_switching_from_southwest_to_delta/,25,2017-10-22 01:19:17,"I'm currently a Southwest flyer and have about 180K Rapid Rewards points in the bank plus Companion Pass, but I'm left wondering what more benefits I could have if I switch the Delta Sky Miles for work travel.

Southwest has been nothing but great for me and my wife. There has literally been zero complaints on any of our travel with Southwest. It just seems like Delta is the ""big boy"" airlines and provides more options in destinations and upgrades.

I travel around 40K to 50K miles a year from Austin, TX.

If I do make the switch, I'll of course get the AMEX Delta CC to aid in the points and replace my Southwest CC.

We have a couple kids, so if we plan a vacation we tend to plan one internationally rather than domestic just because time away is few and far between. Southwest adding Hawaii in 2018 is definitely a plus, but the idea of an actual first class trip somewhere with Delta (plus the Sky Club during layovers) sounds pretty great, too.

Has anyone switched from RR to Delta Sky Miles? And if so, were you happy you made the switch?

Thanks!

125,Cheapo's Guide to the Mexican Coasts,45,68r03b,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/68r03b/cheapos_guide_to_the_mexican_coasts/,24,2017-05-02 08:13:03,"After seeing the great 4-card guide to tahiti post by /u/thecreditkids, It inspired me write this guide about how to get to a Mexican Resort town for Cheap AF (as fuck, not: annual fee). I'm not here to sling some websites or blog launch (although commendable and goodluck TCK), just to share a little knowledge and to make sure people are actually redeeming your GotDam points. Much like the Tahiti post, credit knowledge focuses on budget and upstart churners with low MSQs but should be relevant to the 5/24+  who are happy to make one/2 trip to the PO/WM.

**If Under 5/24:** 

Southwest RR Plus card: 40k-50k bonus (Start with Plus, so when you need premier say you want no Foreign transaction fees, etc)

Good but high MS: Chase sapphire preferred/reserve. 50k Bonus (some say reserve is on it way to increase soon) People have different reasons for taking which one first, but as a budget guide, I say preferred for the waived AF.

**Over (and some under) 5/24 people:**
If you're here I'm assuming you prob have a little smattering of UR, Delta, United, etc floating around, so the redemptions will be cheap options from the card game gambit.



*Marriott Bonus*: 100k Points (5k/3m)- Decent Non - AI redemptions

*IHG Bonus*: 80k Points (1k/3m)- Decent Pricing this summer due to HALF OFF many Mexican AI and standard redemption. Low Min spend, Low AF (Annual Fee, not: as fuck)

*SPG* - Lets be real, we dont wanna waste these, but with nights as low as 4k we will consider it.

*Hyatt Bonus*: 2 Free Nights (2k/3m)- Hands down best card, can be used for AIs (I know these intro bonus nights are so valuable but this place is still a pretty penny at about 380+ a night)

*Choice:* Decent Cheap offerings when transferring from MR.

**PLACES:**

***CABO:***

**Hyatt Ziva**- 20k UR, All inclusive resort . Pretty swanky as far as cabo goes. Quasi four star resort.

**Holiday Inn Los Cabos** - 17.5k IHG (MAY-JUNE 2017) THIS IS THE ABOSOLUTE BEST DEAL FOR ANY ALL INCLUSIVE RESORT. THIS IS SOLID 3 STAR ACCOMMODATIONS WITH DECENT AI PERKS. A must try for beginning churners to get a taste of AI since the 80k + 5k IHG promo nets you nearly 6 nights at an AI (3 without the promo). Don't expect luxury, just a cheerful, basic AI experience. Book before May 7 for the half off deal. Great Cash + pts options too.


**Hyatt Place** - 5k UR, Budget but solid hotel. Not ideal for leisure, as there is no beach service and the beach is across the street, but great for a measly 5k UR. Great place to stay when booking a day tour or 
planning a city day.


***CANCUN:***

**Hyatt ZIVA/ZILARA** - 25k UR, All inclusives. Zilara is the adults only resort and is priced slightly higher than the Ziva. However, the Ziva and TURQUOISE Tower (the Ziva's adult section) is much newer and the rooms and facilities are much nicer--however reports say that Zilara has better quality dining with more upscale liquor/beer options (despite the ziva's onsite microbrewery).

**Intercontinental Presidente Resort** - 15k IHG (MAY-JUNE 2017): If youre not into All inclusives, this is a decent product at a discount. The resort shows some age, but the rooms (with assumed status/preffered/paid upgrades) hold up very well and Merritts the Intercontinental namesake . It is right near the downtown/nightlife area if Cancun (if youre into that). Passable beach and pool, nothing jaw dropping--as comes with this territory. Great Cash + pts options.

**Aloft Cancun** - 4k SPG, This is a great transit hotel if youre getting in from a late flight and dont want to spend many points for that first night. Note: Big with the budget Spring Breaker crowd. Also good if youre planning a day tour to Chitzen itza or Tulum, as these trips typically take all day.


***PUERTO VALLARTA:***

**Hyatt Ziva** - 20k UR, There's not much that stands out at this AI. Its on the low end Hyatt Ziva product line. It is still a very solid 3.5star resort in a great location. I don't recommend this place, for the hyatt free night redemption, but almost passable value for UR if you like AI

**Holiday Inn Express** - 10k IHG (MAY-JUNE 2017) , Not a resort nor a leisure hotel nor on the beach. But for 10k Measly IHG pts, its worth a mention. Younger travelers will gravitate to the nature expeditions in the area, where you can pretend to be a backpacker for over a week by exploring the old town and then after zipline though some trees and shit.

**CasaMagna PV:** 30k Marriott, For those with the supreme luxury of reaching the 100k bonus no prob, this is a decent place with all the digs. Great non AI option for resort seekers, but very low cpp when compared with off season rates and other great 30k options exist across the world. 

**FLIGHTS:**

This guide is really a home run for flyers out of the Los Angeles reigon. As redemptions from LAX to any of  these 3 destinations are as low as 8.5k rt. 

For my early churners..this is why the SWRR card is so crucial. These three cities are great values when flying with SW. Use the SW direct site to browse point costs.


Other origins will not be as forgiving, also finding redemptions on your favorite network will be a greater challenge than the SW portal.

Examples- Round trips as low as:

DFW--->SJD, CUN, PVR = 15k Avios

BOS--->CUN = 20k Avios

DEN---> SJD, CUN, PVR =25k AA , 16k RR

SEA---> SJD, PVR = 30k AA, 12k RR

ATL---->CUN = 17k RR

YMMV. But for max value USE SWRR. 

**ACTIVITIES:** 

Okay, lets say you book one of those 5k or 10k hotels. Chances are you are not at a resort sitting on a nice beach with staff that will bring you drinks. Hell, you gotta pay for breakfast at these places if you don't have Status perks. But no...youre the ""off the beaten path"" traveler. 

Off campus types will enjoy the mass amounts of cultural tours.  For Example: Cancun offers tours to Chitzen Itza and many great ones are on UR. Saw a report that was transpo shuttle, site admission fee, guided tour, mayan buffet lunch, and a swim at a cenote (seasonal) for 5k UR. 

More experienced travelers might also consider renting car. A cheap Mexican market hyundai or nissan runs about 10 bucks a day. Expect a charming 5 speed manual transmission and minimal safety features. More premiums models like a VW Jetta or SUVs run 20-30 USD. A great deal if you have proper licencing and records. This is my favorite option in Mexico because past the Zona Hoteleras are the best parts of Mexico,also Uber is sparce outside the zones. Book though your favorite portal. 

**CONCLUSION:**

Included in this guide are just the budget, easily attainable, or low cost highlights of the deep abyss that is the Mexican resort game.   You guys probably already know alot of this stuff but I think its useful to get it in writing. Im sure there's much more to add but I wanted to get this post out FAST as a PSA due to the great options that IHG has that ends this week. 

The core of this write up was to get early churners started on a path, and get experienced churners REDEEMING on the lower point budget with a decent cpp.

Again....no blog pushing, referral links, nor bamboozle. Just dropping some insights for anyone willing to read.

Cheers.

PS:
More experienced people: please chime in on how your tours booked though UR went!!

127,FAQ: US - Japan,30,3ekcq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3ekcq3/faq_us_japan/,24,2015-07-25 19:13:19,"As I put the finishing touches on my April 2016 LAX - Japan trip, I decided to write a little something something to help others and myself place this popular award travel dream into perspective. The following will set clear some questions that come up a lot both on this subreddit and /r/churning. By no means am I an avid award traveler. This is mostly from my research/FME. No loyalty to an airliner is regarded.

These are some Frequently Asked Questions regarding award travel to Japan from the US. These start very basic and then get a bit more complicated.



**1.) What is the most efficient way to get to Japan from the US via award travel?**

Definitely American Airlines AAdvantage Miles. 

One-way award seats at 25k (off-peak),50k, 62.5k miles for econ, business, first are difficulty to beat. Especially when the competition usually charges high fees. Plus, you earn 10% back on points if you have an AA Aviator Red, Aviator Silver, Platinum Select, Executive credit card open.



**2.) Where are all the US - Japan award flights on AA.com? They are not showing up!**

Many (all?) partner flights do not even show up AA.com. Search on British Airway's (start here), Qantas', or Japan Airlines' award reservation system. Note the flight #. Call AA's reservation line @ 1-800-882-8880. Make sure to tell them the flight is not visible on aa.com, but you know for a fact it exist and is available. The CS rep. should waive the phone booking fee because of this comment.



**3.) I still do not see award flights on the BA/Qantas/JAL award reservation system. How can I get the flight I want?**

Well they obviously exist. Please note that availability is quite low, especially for the business and first class seats. You may have to book close to 11 months in advance to be sure you get the ticket on the dates you want.

Some have had luck booking flights weeks/days before departure. Sometimes additional reward seats are released close to departure. Huge YMMV here. So good luck.



**4.) I do not have enough AA miles and cannot churn to the needed AA miles (for X reason). I got loads of United and Delta points though. What are some of my options?**

United will charge 70k miles for a round-trip award ticket. [Further breakdown regarding partners and ticket type here.](http://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx) Expect much higher fees with United compared to AA. United's reservation system will show most all partnered award flights.

Sorry IDK shit about Delta :D. All I know is its possible. Delta's reservation system will show a decent amount of partnered award flights, and Delta miles are not as efficient as the competition.



**5.) I want to see much of Japan. How much are Japan Domestic flights?**

British Airways will charge 4,500 miles plus a $2 fee for one-way JAL domestic flights. You can travel between major cities via The Bullet Train...



**6.) I want to see much of Japan. Is The Bullet Train worth using when on budget compared to British Airways short haul flights? What is the JR pass and what are its key limitation? How can I get it for free?**

Yes, the Bullet Train (Shinkansen) is worth it if you get the JR pass. The passes start at 29,110 Yen (currently this is $234.02 on 21/7/2015) for the seven day option. 

The JR pass key limitation that we care about is the fact that it can only be bought when outside of Japan and can only be bought my tourists. There are many rules and limitations, but it is still worth. I've read that the Green JR Pass is not worth for the typical tourist.

[Please read through all the rules here.](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/) There are many ways to use the pass and it would be unfortunate to realize a specific thing you wanted to use it for is not allowed.

You can get it for free by redeeming points/""miles"" against the charge. Like on the Arrival +, Cap1 Venture, or other credit cards of the like. Sign-up bonuses for these cards are higher than the cost of the JR pass.

*The JR Pass will code as Tourist Attaction on the Arrival +. You will have to call to get the charge erased with your points. We don't know how the recent changes to the Arrival + effected this option.



**7.) What about award stays at hotels? Any recommendations?**

Redeeming the two free nights [from this Chase sign-up bonus](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/hyatt-card.aspx) at the Park Hyatt Tokyo is a very popular option around here. Book ahead since availability is killer.

The SPG Sheraton in Osaka is an extremely cheap points option @4k points a night.

Cannot go wrong with AirBnB. Japanese hospitality is highly regarded. The host may really help you out here. Statement credit points/miles can be used to cover AirBnB charges.



**8.) What sort of awards can I redeem if I want to fly Singapore Airlines? Should I redeem through United or Singapore if I have the option?**

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles can be redeemed at 32.5k, 77.5k, and 87.5k miles for econ, business, and first class/suites respectfully when flying from West Coast US. [Go here to look at their full award chart.](http://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQMI_OneWayAwardCharts.pdf) Now take into account the 15% miles discount if you book online and Singapore Airlines' legendary service quality. You are getting great value for these options.

Amex MR, Chase UR, Citi TY points, and SPG points can all be transferred to Singapore KrisFlyer miles. So you have a lot of easy churning strategies.

Note that some Singapore Air econ and business tickets are on sale right now (as of 21/07/2015) and may not be worth booking econ with miles. It will always be very worth it to redeem miles for Singapore Business/First Class/Suite award seats.

Also, keep it mind that Singapore Air charges above average fees for award tickets. We talking slightly over $100 for SFO/LAX - HND/NRT business; still worth though.

United will charge less for the econ seat, both in points and fees. Unfortunately, United charges more points for business and first class/suite. Also, United has less availible award seats than their partners on a per partner flight bases. If you don't see an business/first class award seat on United, it may still be open on Singapore.



**9.) What other great business and first class award seats are available?**

The Points Guy talks highly about the JAL First class experience. Plus, its only 62.5k AA miles for one-way award seat. Avalibility is extremely low so book well in advanced. Do a little research on the service and you'll fall in love.



**10.) What are you going to do in Japan?**

129,Detailed analysis of why a particular flight prices higher on the Chase UR Portal than elsewhere and why Chase may randomly book into the wrong fare type (Economy <-> Basic Economy),91,7bgiqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7bgiqq/detailed_analysis_of_why_a_particular_flight/,24,2017-11-08 00:45:58,"Hello everyone, I wanted to post this here since I've seen a few articles on odd prices or booking situations with Chase's UR portal but I never understood what was happening until today.  This is not an exhaustive analysis since it only looks at one route, however I have verified that it seems to apply to all economy fare classes on this route on Lufthansa and is very misleading when trying to book a flight.

**The key takeaway is don't always assume CSR UR Portal is truly 1.5cpp or booked into the fare class you expect (at least for Lufthansa, edit: Alitalia too).  In this post I expand slightly upon an analysis done by FrequentMiler last year on the subject in which he found the same conclusion.**

**Background:** Last year FrequentMiler posted an [article](http://frequentmiler.boardingarea.com/2016/10/05/sapphire-reserve-points-really-worth-1-5-cents-towards-flights/) disputing the value of the Chase UR portal.  He was correct in determining you do not always get 1.5cpp based on how Chase prices flights.  However, he chalked up the reasoning to Chase booking into a higher fare classes.  After staring at booking my own Lufthansa flights for the past 2 days I think I finally see what is going on.

**Background on my situation:** I'm trying to book a flight on 11/19/2017 to get from FRA to FCO in economy.  I found a Lufthansa flight that perfectly fits my needs and we went and booked that flight.  The flight # is LH240 for those who care.  I first investigated other options but ultimately looked at the UR portal to book this.

**The booking:** First step was to look at Google Flights.  I found my flight and went to confirm the price on  the Chase UR portal.  It did not match.  The Google Flights price was cheaper than the price I was seeing by about $20.

This was concerning so just to be sure, I hopped over to Lufthansa.com and priced the exact same flight.  Lufthansa has three tiers of Economy (at least for intra-Europe flights): Light, Classic, and Flex.  After comparing the options, I determined that the Chase must be looking at the Economy Classic fare for this flight.  This meshed with FrequentMiler's analysis and I chalked the $1-2 difference up to the exchange rate.

I then proceeded with my booking.  At first the booking appeared when I checked it on Lufthansa.com but it had not ticketed yet - this isn't an issue.  A few hours later I checked again and everything looked good except I was shown as being in Economy Light rather than Economy Classic.  This was confirmed by the price to pick seats and the bag fees I shouldn't have (you get 1 free checked bag on an Europe Economy Classic fare).

**Contacting Chase:** At first I thought this was a glitch and tried cancelling and rebooking.  This did not work - the flight still ticketed into basic economy.  Not knowing why I was getting economy light for economy classic price, I decided to reach out to Chase.  I tried contacting them, but it took 3 calls before I had a rep willing to do a manual booking for me to delve deeper.  She kept bumping the fare higher and higher to figure out what was going on but couldn't simply rebook me.  She did confirm that I had bought a basic economy fare though - I thanked her for her help and started doing my own research.

**Fare Classes:** At least for these intra-Europe fares, Lufthansa does not have a specific fare class for each tier of service.  What I mean is that for my flight they did not offer E for Basic Economy and Y for normal economy like Delta would, but rather they were selling all economy fares at the same fare class, S.  Looking deeper on ExpertFlyer, I could see that S just meant ""Economy"" so Chase cannot see the difference as easily as they can with Delta.  What this means is you may accidentally buy Economy Light without realizing it.

**Fare Basis Codes:** This is where I started to get an idea of what was going on.  When I looked at this route on ExpertFlyer and ITA Matrix, I could see that Lufthansa was able to make the determination of what tier of economy you were in based on a little code on your ticket called a fare basis.  This basis tells what class of service your in and what price you pay.  For Lufthansa, they use the codes S37LGT9A, S37CLS9A and S37FLX9A to denote Economy Light, Economy Classic, and Economy Flex, respectively.

Looking on ExpertFlyer you can see the base fare that each of these codes should cost.  Using ITA Matrix, you can find flight strictly using the fare basis code and the flight number if you want.  When I did this, I found that my ticket corresponded to the S37LGT9A code rather than the S37CLS9A code I expected.  

This meant that I was booked in Economy Light even though I thought I was getting Economy Classic.  The missing piece of the puzzle to explain the discrepancy came from looking at a breakdown of the taxes and fees.

**OTA Surcharge:** Airlines have 2 surcharges that they can arbitrarily tack on to a flight.  The biggest one we see is YQ - commonly referred to as fuel surcharges.  One other option is YR - from what I've seen they are essentially the same thing insofar as they raise the price of a ticket and are carrier controlled.  In the case of this Lufthansa flight though, the YR surcharge was interesting: it only appeared on OTA bookings.  When pricing the flight out on Lufthansa's website, they quote the taxes and fees at 64.64 EUR, this represents a few different charges including the standard YQ surcharge.  When pricing the bookings out on OTA's websites, Lufthansa is quoting the taxes and fees at 80.64 EUR.  The same surcharges as before are present except one addition, a YR surcharge of 16 EUR.  From what I saw it didn't matter which OTA you used, Lufthansa jacks the price up by 16 EUR no matter what.

**Back to my booking:** Looking back at my flight, I can see now that it is almost exactly 16 EUR pricier than the basic economy option on Lufthansa's website.  The difference is just the exchange rate but works out to just a few cents difference.  It seems not only am I booked into Economy Light, but I'm also being charged like I'm in normal economy.

The following table is an example of the fare codes I could have booked yesterday and what they should have cost + cpp based on my flight needs.

**EDIT: Same goes for Alitalia it seems - added to table**

**EDIT 2: Alitalia seems to price out correctly on Chase, but can't sift thru the fares as easily on OTAs**

Airline | Fare Basis Code (from ExpertFlyer) | Booking Class | Fare Name | Base Fare (from ExpertFlyer) | Surcharges | OTA Surcharges (YR) | Total Price (Direct) | Total Price (OTAs) | CPP (Chase UR vs LH.com price)
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
LH240 | S37**LGT**9A | S | Economy **Light** | 135 EUR | 64.64 EUR | 16 EUR | 199.64 EUR | **215.64 EUR** | **1.39**
LH240 | S37**CLS**9A | S | Economy **Classic** | 155 EUR | 64.64 EUR | 16 EUR | **219.64 EUR** | 235.64 EUR | **1.39**
LH240 | S37**FLX**9A | S | Economy **Flex** | 195 EUR | 64.64 EUR | 16 EUR | 259.64 EUR | 275.64 EUR | **1.41**
AZ407 | XO**LG**3E1 | X | Economy **Light** | 61 EUR | 83.64 EUR | 0 EUR | 144.64 EUR | 144.64 EUR | Did not check
AZ407 | XO**CL**3E1 | X | Economy **Classic** | 81 EUR | 83.64 EUR | 0 EUR | 164.64 EUR | 164.64 EUR | **1.5**
AZ407 | NO**FL**3E1 | N | Economy **Flex** | 252 EUR | 83.64 EUR | 0 EUR | 335.64 EUR | 335.64 EUR | Did not check

**As you can see here, the ticket I bought was remarkably similar to the normal economy fare showing on Lufthansa's site, but because they don't use a distinct fare class, Chase can't figure out what they are.  They don't warn you if you're about to book one of these fares either.  The only way to see is if you read the fare rules for the ticket which isn't always easy to decipher.  Now this may be different for different flights, but for this one in particular it's clear that Chase is not marking things up and glitching out - Lufthansa is.  Overall this is a needlessly complicated system and makes Chase points much harder to use since it's either a crap shoot or requires calling in to book.**

**TL;DR:** Found out today that Chase either can't or won't distinguish between Lufthansa's Economy and Economy Light fares at time of booking.  This is in contrast to Delta's Basic Economy (E) fares which get a bright red/orange warning each time you consider booking them.  This is because Lufthansa uses the same fare classes for Economy, Economy Light, and Economy Flex - the base fare determines the tier of service.

Also found out that Lufthansa marks up their prices on all OTAs intentionally or otherwise by 16 EUR for these flights.  This random extra charge makes the basic economy fare look similar to the normal economy fare right from the get go which makes it seem like you're getting something you're not.  This is why some flights appear higher priced on Chase on others."

&#x200B;

I booked a flight for September 2019 using Korean Air Skypass miles on Delta metal for roundtrip LAX to AMS with some intra-europe flights mixed in. Well it seems that Delta has cancelled the LAX/AMS route entirely. So now my inbound and outbound flights are cancelled, but my intra-europe flights are still there. I have made a bunch of reservations around these dates and I am going to wedding so the dates need to stick and I have about $6000 in reservations. I also booked this 6 months ago.

Been on the phone for hours with Delta and Korean Air (they keep telling me to call the other one). No saver award availability at all. And it seems like Delta won't put me on any of their flights.

I am honestly just expecting Korean Air to just cancel the award booking. And I will probably skip the wedding and the trip entirely.

Anyone have any advice or a course of action?

&#x200B;

EDIT - Wanted to give an update with the end result. I got Delta to put me on DL118 (Delta Suites) to Paris and then on to Rome on Alitalia. Will just take a short train ride to Florence. On the way back they were able to get me Delta One (A330) through JFK and then the 767 on to LAX.  Pretty great result! Thanks for the help everyone. It was helpful to call Korean air and guide them to contacting Delta to open some space."

I usually travel within the US and I'm more the kind of person that would book the United super saver 7,500/one-way than 200,000 roundtrip (which, now that I think about it, is kind of weird, since I barely travel anymore).

I have saved up a couple hundred thousand UR points over the past several years and will lose my ability to transfer them out this week for almost one year (read: I will be cancelling my cards and will remain 5/24 with an income that is 1/2-1/3 my current cumulative CL until next Summer). My home airport for the next year is RDU, which is serviced by most airlines (https://www.rdu.com/airline-information/rdu-airlines/), and I have already transferred some URs to WN and UA. 

Is it worth transferring more URs to other airlines in case I fly? I was thinking that Virgin Atlantic might be worthwhile, given the possibility of booking award flights on Delta, since Delta flights tend to be more expensive. Of course, there are many other transfer options and I could also sit on the points for the next year, though I worry about sitting on all of them for that long, not knowing when subsequent devaluation/new restrictions (e.g. not allowing transfer of URs between cards) might occur.

So I called Korean Air, SkyAlliance, and Delta. The Delta people told me that the flight was not canceled, and that it was still on for the same times I originally booked for. The Korean Air people told me they were going to have someone call me back in 24 hours... When the people finally called me back the guy had no clue what I was talking about, and was totally useless. 


I called back Korean Air and explained my problem once again. The difficult part is that I had to book the flights under 2 different reservations since we do not qualify for the ""Family Booking"" for Korean Air just yet. (We arent family yet!). This Korean Air operator was much more helpful and told me that they should be able to put me back on the same flight at the same time, and that once again they would call me back within 24 hours.



When I search for the same flight it shows on the Delta website, and all first class seats are available to book. The flight does not show up under the Korean Air search though. In fact, none of the flights to Calgary show under that day anymore, this slightly worries me. 



Does anyone have any advice/ been in this situation before? Should I be able to get any coupons or vouchers for the issues I have experienced? What should I be asking for when I talk to the representatives/ who is the most productive person to call? Thank y'all for your time. I'm really just worried because I transferred 90K UR points to Korean Air to pay for this flight. I do not want them to ""refund"" my Korean Air points, and then I'm stuck with Korean Sky Pesos instead of UR.


**********UPDATE*********


The reservation has vanished from the ""My reservations"" tab on the Korean Air website. The flight is still listed under my tickets though


**********UPDATE 2*********



Korean Air has changed my flight without consulting me to a different flight that has an overnight layover in Salt Lake City, and it on different days. This does not work for me because of pre-booked honeymoon hotels that are completely full. I will keep trying



********Update 3*********



Just got off the phone with SkyTeam Employee. We talked about transferring my flight to one that is on the same day, and also getting my Fiance on my flight. He said he would contact Delta and get back to me in 24 hours. Also asked about Alaskan Air, so we can see if he can do anything. I will keep this thread updated"

135,Best way to redeem for 2 business/first class flights to New Zealand any time in 2018?,9,7ixt7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7ixt7i/best_way_to_redeem_for_2_businessfirst_class/,23,2017-12-11 02:34:46,"Hey all,

I see regular questions about this destination on this subreddit, and know this is one of the toughest routes to redeem points on, but figured I would toss it out there. 

I'm trying to get my wife and I to New Zealand for a second honeymoon (she had almost no vacation days so we had a really short honeymoon earlier this year). I'm based in PHX, but I have a SW companion pass so really any of the major airports on the west coast could be fair game for routing.

Ideally we'd like to fly direct, but I know there are some routing options through ICN and HNL, particularly going through Australia. I've never redeemed for a premium cabin before, and am mostly a Southwest flier, so this is a bit confusing for me...

Here's what I have to work with. It seems like a lot but I'd still like to use it wisely. Still, I'm sure these will be devalued soon so I need to start burning them.

* Delta: 160K
* American: 172K
* AMEX MR: 333K
* Chase UR: 331K
* SPG: 525K
* Southwest: 493K

I assume availability is either nonexistent or extremely tight most of the year, so is business class to New Zealand still a feasible option for next year? We're not picky at all about when we go, since we'd be totally fine traveling there outside the normal tourist season.

I'd lean towards business class if there is availability, but if there was ever a trip I'd splurge for first this would be it, so I'm open to anything!

Thanks!"

I would like to do so by booking on Delta Metal through Korean.  A few questions I am still unsure on:


* Does availability open 330 days out?
* Does anyone have a good source of information on the best searches to use for this availability? (It sounds like my options are via Air France, where I can't currently get anything to show for next May when I search - am I doing it wrong? or through Delta and guessing as to what is Saver fare?)
* I am open to my routings (Toronto, Buffalo, Rochester departure airports) but would like to stop in San Francisco for a couple days on my way out.  Does anyone see a way to do this?  Using AwardHacker, I'm not seeing any routes through San Francisco. It only shows me Delta routes through MSP or ATL or SLC. **Seems like going through SLC may be my best bet.  Interesting city to explore plus gets us through a couple time zones**

""United changed their schedule and made the connection impossible!!!""

""United cancelled IAH-SYD for my date....."" etc. 

So you booked an award ticket in first class, and of course something goes wrong. What can you do? 

This is the guide to what you can do in this situation. Feel free to inform me if any part of the guide is wrong, and leave comments about your rebooking experiences.

====================================

The situations are mostly categorized as:

- Whether the ticket is sold by a US carrier (United, AA, Delta), or Asian carrier (ANA, EVA, etc); I never bought an award ticket through European carriers, so can't comment on that

- Whether the airline that sold you the ticket flies the route, eg. both ANA and United flies SFO-NRT

For simplicity, I would call the airline that sold you the ticket ""ticketing carrier"" TC, and the metal ""operating carrier"" OC

Basic knowledge:

Q: Flight cancelled! Who do I call?

A: TC. They sold you the ticket. OC will most likely not willing to modify the ticket, and can only takeover the ticket T-24h to departure.

==================================
Scenarios

a. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through US carriers

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

b. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through Asian carriers

- They will do the same and rebook you to your desired route on their own metal. This is true for the recent EVA strike.

c. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC flies the route

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

d. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC flies the route

- Varies.

- ANA: They WILL NOT open up their own space. Eg. SFO-TPE Eva air ticket through ANA. ANA can fly SFO-NRT-TPE, but THEY WILL NOT rebook you on their own metal. If no award ticket exists, they will CANCEL your ticket, and issue a refund. You can try to do a three way call (you, TC, OC), but most likely won't get you too far.

- Singapore airlines: They will rebook onto their own metal. 

- Need data points for other Asian carriers. 

e. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- You are probably out of luck. TC can't open up it's own space since they don't fly there, and they can't force OC to open up award space. You can try a three way call but you won't get too far. If TC flies to a nearby airport or award space exists for a nearby airport (eg. United flies to EWR, and original ticket was JFK), they should be willing to change your destination.

f. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- Worst case scenario. You can do a three way call, but most likely the ticket will just be cancelled. 


This is what I have experienced, and read stories on. Please feel free to correct me and share your experiences.

Lastly, when a ticket is cancelled, please be rational. If you book an intra-China ticket on Air China through United and the ticket is cancelled, don't expect United to force Air China to open a ticket; the ticket will most likely be cancelled."

Wife and I are planning a trip to Italy for October of 2018.  We have to plan ahead, and are willing to spend more miles to do so, because we are leaving two small kids behind and have to arrange for child care while we are going which makes the dates not very flexible. This is my first planned big redemption and its a big trip for us.  With the two kids, we don't do a lot of travel besides some family trips.  So, you will see that a lot of points are looking to be spent, but this is an anniversary trip and I don't see us travelling internationally again for more than 5 years after this.  The goal is to do 1st class and 5 star throughout.  We have been accumulating points for over 2 years. 

I also plan to checkoff a bucket list item, SQ suites.  While, I know it would be a better redemption doing an AP flight.. See above ^^. 

I understand that some people like Air BNB for Italy, we want to do hotels and want to do luxury 5 star on this trip.

The Delta, Hilton, Hyatt and Starwood balances are from flying and hotels, not credit cards.

Plan:

* Depart RDU on 9/25 -> ATL -> FCO on DL 64 flying in Delta One.  I am routinely seeing that route for 70k miles per person for a Tuesday departure 1 year out.  I plan to book that ticket on 10/29 using the 117K DL miles and transferring the remaining from 23k from MRs. 

* Rome: 2 days.  Waldorf Astoria Hotel.   (but I am questioning that decision, see below).  160k.  Will sign up for Hilton Amex before 10/4 for 100k. I should earn the remaining 7k on actual travel before I have to book.  But will fill in with MR where necessary.  This hotel decision is up for debate. 

* Florence: 2 days.  Grand Amore Hotel.  Booked through the Chase portal.  66k UR.  

* Venice: 2 days JW Marriot.  90k Points.  Wife to apply for Marriot 80k visa.  10K UR to cover difference.  This hotel decision is up for debate. 

* VCE -> FRA on Lufthansa in main cabin.  Will buy this ticket cash $443 using my chase travel credit to offset $300 of it.  Will book on Jan 1st.  This will be an evening flight landing around 8:00pm in FRA. 

* Frankfurt: Sheraton attached to airport.  7k points.  Transfer 2k MRs to cover. 

* FRA - JFK: SQ suites.  260k MR.  Will book this as soon as it opens up.  It appears they open flights up randomly... So, I guess I will just be checking every few hours and not sleeping. 

* JFK -> RDU:  Will purchase a flight after Jan 1st and use my other $300 Chase travel credit to cover. 


Questions:

  * DL opens up tickets for sale 331 days in advance. What time of day do they do that? 
  * When should I book hotels? 
  * I am questioning doing the Waldorf in Rome. Its outside the city, there seem to be no benefits to being Hilton Gold there (no free breakfast, no lounge access).  Anyone have pros/cons on Waldorf in Rome to share? 
  * Just like the Waldorf, the Marriott hotel has drawbacks.  It is on its own private island which is nice.  But gold status does not get you free breakfast or lounge access. The rooms just seem 'Ok'.  I would be open to other hotels options in Venice.  If I can find a better non-Hilton hotel in Rome, I could consider the Hilton Molino Stucky.  The Gritti Palace seems like the best option, but the SPG signups are not great right now.
  * Any way to get from Venice to Frankfurt without paying cash?
  * The general booking plan is to secure the SQ flight first, then the DL flight next.  Position for suggested hotels considering current bonus and then connecting flights as soon as I can use Chase travel credits to cover.  Is that the optimal way to approach this?

Note:  This is the optimal itinerary, if something happens with DL, I can flip it around and land in VCE first and fly out of FCO.


Edit:  Based on some feedback and further research, my current plan is to not do Waldorf or the JW Marriott.  Instead I plan to book JK Place Roma using URs and The Gritti Palace using SPG points.  I will wait for some decent signups for SPG.  I will then shift from the Sheraton in Frankfurt to Hilton Garden Inn in Frankfurt.

147,Advice on Positioning Flight,6,ca8dxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/ca8dxr/advice_on_positioning_flight/,23,2019-07-07 20:01:56,"Looking for some quick advice on a positioning flight to LAX. I have a LAX-CDG booked for next December. This flight departs at 12:20. I need to position there from TUS. Wondering which flight I should book:

1) Delta, arriving at 9am

2) AA, arriving at 9am (only reason I would do this is that I have gold status, but would be booking basic econ so minimal effect)

3) Southwest, arriving at 6:45 am

&#x200B;

Price is identical between all 3. Leaning towards the delta flight over southwest, since I'd rather not get up at 4am (although this might actually be beneficial for adjusting to European time...) but I'd be counting on a 3 hr layover being adequate. Appreciate any thoughts!"

Could we have a discussion around flights?  Particularly J flights?

My specific home airport is CLT but for this discussion let’s focus on any of the major east coast airports, with NYC probably having the most availability from what I can see.

I’m seeing a couple of routes right now that look interesting.

1) Emirates NYC->MLE by way of Dubai

This would be definitely my first choice however the surcharges on awards tickets booked via Korean or Singapore are huge.  

However... there don’t seem to be huge surcharges on a one way on this route coming *back* from MLE.  However this does mean I can’t book via Korean since you can only book round trip awards flights that way on partners.

Am I missing anything here?

2). Air France CDG -> MLE direct

Getting to Paris from the east coast isn’t particularly hard so not going to worry about that part.

This one is bookable via Delta and Air France/Flying Blue.  Even saw some Delta one ways at reasonable mileage.


What other routes/Airlines/booking methods should be considered for this?

What should be avoided?

150,Amex Platinum - Centurion and delta lounges with guest? How do they define a guest?,0,cghitr,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/cghitr/amex_platinum_centurion_and_delta_lounges_with/,22,2019-07-22 23:10:12,"I'll often be traveling with a co-worker (business trips) or my GF (personal trips). Can I get them into the lounge as my guest? I've seen some very ambiguous and also specific requirements on various websites. Does ""guest"" mean immediate family? since my GF and I are not married, will that be ok?  Will my co-worker and I have to argue with them and pretend to be in a domestic partnership in order to get in? 

In any of these cases we will be taking the same flights, so boarding passes will show the same info.

**Edit: THANKS I misread this on Amex's site and thought It was saying 2 guests that are immediate family. 
""Centurion members may enter with up to two guests or immediate family (spouse or domestic partner, and children under 18)  at no additional charge.""**"

With this redemption in mind, I went ahead and transferred Amex MR to Virgin Atlantic before the 30% bonus promo ended last week.  So, I now have 240K Virgin Atlantic miles.

It appears that my two best options are ANA first (F) class from LAX, SFO, or IAH (DFW is my home airport but I can relocate easily) or Delta One Suites (A350) from LAX.

Two questions:
1. Is it worth flying out of LAX or SFO (rather than IAH) in order to be able to fly into Haneda instead of Narita?
2. It appears that either redemption will cost me virtually the same number of Virgin Atlantic miles.  However, the ANA fuel surcharges are significantly higher.  Is ANA worth the additional several hundred dollars per person fuel surcharges?

Thanks!

152,Delta SkyMiles First Class Devaluation?,1,aigmg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/aigmg7/delta_skymiles_first_class_devaluation/,26,2019-01-22 02:45:30,"I have a ton of Delta SkyMiles (almost 1,000,000)...mainly through years of saving these points through use of a Delta credit card for major work purchases. I do not fly a ton (silver medallion status on Delta) and I have never booked a reward flight with Delta.

I'd like to take my family (3 of us total) on business or first class seats to somewhere in Asia with a beach (Thailand, Bali, etc.). I haven't checked Delta's award chart in a couple of years, but it looks like they have seriously devalued their award travel. I cannot find any award tickets to Asia from any American city for less than 560,000 miles.

My questions:

1. Is this the new modus operandi going forward for Delta? Is it even worth using Skymiles to book first class award travel?
2. Is there a trick for finding tickets for less skymiles? I've searched the internet, but most sites recommend transferring points from Chase or something like that (which I cannot do). I am looking at any week in March to any beach destination in Asia from about anywhere in the United States (would prefer somewhere in the midwest between Ohio and Utah).

153,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Amex MRs,36,49tbmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/,22,2016-03-10 16:00:58,"I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I'm going to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex’s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The “high season” is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 “high season” will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The “low season” is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “low season” and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “high season”. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “low season” and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “high season”.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions – Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic’s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al’s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al’s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (“WS”) is January 1 – March 24 and November 1 – December 31, while the Summer Season (“SS”) is March 25 – October 31.  El Al’s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan – from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!"

Currently I have:

\- 105,181 Chase Ultimate Rewards Points  
\- 53,996 Delta Skymiles  
\- 40,087 SPG Points

I understand that I may not have enough points right now but I travel every week for work so these points are always increasing and because of this I have a few questions:

1. when is the best time for me to book flights? 

* I have heard 3 months in advance to like 2 week in advance but I don't know what is the truth and if that applies to me due to me trying to use my various points as payment. Is it too late to get award flights, have I fucked myself?

2. is there a way for me to combine all these points easily?

* I know that UR will not transfer to Delta directly but there are some roundabout ways I can get them there. I have read those articles and get so overwhelmed and confused by the process. I think I need someone to ELI5 if this even is a possibility anymore. 

3. should I get a Delta CC now in hopes to accrue enough frequent flier miles before the trip?

4. I'm a Gold Medallion member on Delta so if I book a flight with them, what are the chances of getting upgraded to business/first class? Does this happen on international flights? Does this happen if I use points to pay for a flight? Is this a stupid question?

\------------------------------------------

Here's my plan of attack, and any constructive criticism is welcome:

Step 1: we live in TN and while we have an international airport here, it seems cheaper if we fly out from one of the coasts so I need to determine if it's cheaper to fly from LAX or JFK.

Step 2: if cheaper to fly out from the coast, use my Delta Skymiles to get us to one of those places.

Step 3: determine the best and cheapest airline to fly to MAN on and if I can transfer my SPG points to UR.

Step 4: if that airline is a Chase travel partner, transfer points to that airline and purchase tickets or purchase ticket directly through the UR portal.

Step 5 (optional): if possible, use cold, hard cash to pay for upgraded tickets.

Step 6: get to the Philippines and have stupids amount of fun :D

I would like to plan a mileage run in early December that would earn 14,000 MQM and 1,300 MQD.  I am based out of CMH.  By using the Delta website and looking at their earnings calculator, the best flight I can find is CMH-PVG in Premium Select and that comes to 22,412 MQM, 1630 MQD, for a price of $1,721.03.  I Also looked at CMH-NRT in Comfort Plus but it was about $100 short on MQD.

&#x200B;

The CMH-PVG flight is way more MQM than I need and several hundred more MQD than I need, and I would prefer not to fly across the Pacific if at all possible (like I would rather fly a shorter distance and pay a bit more if necessary).  I haven't found a route in the USA that would get me the necessary MQM.  Do you guys have better ideas?  Also, I was wondering how booking on Delta's partners work since their MQM earnings are higher, but is this not already factored in when I book on Delta's website?  As in, should I try booking on Aeromexico's website for a flight to Latin America?  Or does it not work like that?  Also, is there a calculator that I can see how much that flight would earn if that is the right way to do it?

Right now we are thinking of doing 7-10 days at the Hyatt Zilara in Jamaica. We are both pretty frugal so the idea of an all inclusive is kinda nice so we can have a trip where we don’t have to care about $40 dinners, lol. We would be open to anywhere else on the world though. We would prefer at least 3-4 days on a beach though. 

Traveling from Sioux Falls (FSD): United, Delta, and American. 

UR points: currently have 75k, fiancée was just approved for CSP for 60k, plan to MS about 12k per month in points. Should have about 200k UR by year end. 

MR points: currently 80k, plan to ms another 80k on the Amex gold. Should have around 160k by year end (Could hit it hard in Jan/feb to get another 100k, but some of those points wouldn’t post until March so that’s cutting it close).

SW: 95k

I will be 3/24 in August after 8 cards hit 2 years. Plan on getting the chase Hyatt for 50k points.

Edit: we like to do some easy/moderate hiking and sightseeing, try new foods. I guess to give you an idea of the types of vacations we have done: last year we did San Francisco, checked out the redwoods, downtown SF, just walking around Chinatown to try the food, fireworks over the bay of 4th of July, then Monterey and down to bixby bridge. Next we did Puerto Rico and Miami. Tried to see the rain forest, but 75% of it was still closed so bummed about that. Checked out old San Juan and  Castillo San Felipe del Morro, try the local food, Bacardi distillery, spent a couple days just relaxing at the beach at Wyndham Margaritaville. Went to a Dolphins game in Miami, drive down to the keys for a day, spent a day at Miami Beach. Then in April, Hawaii. Kuaui (5 days) Maui (3 days). Food trucks, Koke’e, Waimea canyon, boat cruise of the na pali coast, road to Hana, Haleakala, beach time. 

I’m into history, she likes historical buildings. Like I said, we want a beach too. At least 3-4 days without leaving the property (except maybe for food if not inclusive). Probably went from not enough detail to too much detail, lol. Thanks in advance.

Just to add, before Hawaii I played around the idea of saving for a RTW trip. She didn’t like the idea of being gone for 6 weeks, so we blew some points on Hawaii. Some destinations I came up when brainstorming that were Bali (beach), Japan (culture), New Zealand (idk, she likes it), Egypt (history), Italy (history), and Peru (Machu Picchu)."

Singapore, Maldives, Tokyo Jan 2017 | **93.k SQ miles** on SQ Suites JFK-FRA-SIN, One way cash flight to MLE on tigerair, **75k Hyatt** for Park Hyatt Maldives, **15k Avois** MLE-CMB-SIN, **40k UA miles** on ANA F SIN-NRT, **80k AA miles** on JAL F | So this was my biggest goal and redemption. So this was my biggest goal and redemption. For years I’ve read about SQ Suites and my #1 goal in churning was this and I got it. Stayed in a hostel again in Singapore and man was it humid. I figured since I was in Signapore and the Maldives was so close, why not try and go for it. Park Hyatt didn’t have free nights available for my certificates but it was available for 25k per night. Booked 3 nights and paid for a cheap tigerair fight out. In hindsight, the tigerair was late at night, didnt get to PH until 1am. That was a waste. I’ve never been to a resort before and this was beautiful. Oh yea, used my Arrival miles to pay for the transfer fee. For this trip, I wanted to fly out of Tokyo either on JAL or ANA. I flew back to SIN using avois on SriLankan Y. I found a cheap 40k UA miles one way on ANA F. Hell yea I’m taking it and to my surprised it on the BB-8 plane. Spent another weekend in Tokyo, ate and drank away. JAL opened up and I took it home from NRT-JFK for 80k AA miles. I flew around the planet in 11 days.
Rome Feb 2017 | **60k Skypesos** on Altalia Y | I was itching to go away again and went to Rome for a long Prez weekend. Stayed at the Yellow Hostel, which I recommend to everyone. Toured, ate and drank away. I’m not religious by any means but man the Vactican was impressive. I’d love to visit again. During this weekend, I was drunk at the hostel bar and figured to myself why not try and do 12 trips in 12 months for 2017. 
Cancun Mar 2017 | **6k Jetblue** one way JFK-CUN, Cash flight Delta with gc CUN-JFK, **2 night free Hyatt Cert** at Hyatt Zilara | Used my 2 Hyatt free night at Hyatt Zilara Cancun. Beautiful property, great good. My friend and I ate our way through this weekend. Sushi was trash.
Puerto Rico April 2017 | **25k Merrill points** | This weekend happened to have a big storm in NYC. My flight delayed for 2 days. Tested out the trip delay insurance and hey they approved it even tho JFK was my home airport. Spent 2 days in Puerto Rico. Wish I had more time to explore.
Iceland May 2017 | Cash flight | Went to Iceland for a long Memorial day weekend. Stayed a hostel again. Man Iceland is f’king expensive. I could not be the foodie like I wanted to because it was so expensive. Went on a tour that took us to a natural hot spring, that was cool. Didn’t do blue lagoon. Made a hostel friend and tagged along his ride for the day. Love to go back when I have some extra extra money. The daylight at 2am was insane. Definitely messed with my head
Havana June 2017 | **SW CP to Havana** | Made a churning friend and we went to Havana. Humid af, didn’t understand all the hype about it. Would not go back.
Tijuana July 2017 | Walked over to Tijuana | Ok, this one I cheated a bit. I was in town in San Diego for Comic Con and to make sure I was out of the country, I walked over the border to Tijuana, ate some tacos and walked back over.
Thailand August 2017 | **120k UA miles** on Asiana F going, **80k ANA J** back. | So this was booked over Thanksgiving 2016. My friend’s biggest goal was going to Thailand and we were researching ways to get there. He wanted to fly any J class and we found 80k Asiana J one way. Impulsively we booked it roundtrip. Over the course of 2017, I moved over another 40k from UR to UA and upgraded myself to Asiana F. The look on my friend’s face when he realized I was flying F day of, was priceless. Of course I invited him down to my suite and we drank some whisky. We paid cash for our hotel stays in Thailand. Have to say, the Hilton gold came in handy for breakfast. Went to Bangkok, Chang Mai, Phi Phi Islands and Phuket. Love to go back and explore more of the islands. I hope that russian milf is doing well.
Bahamas September 2017 | **25k Skypesos** on Delta Y, **40k Hyatt** at Grand Hyatt Baha Mar | Delta had a flash sale to the Carribean for 25k and I moved over 40k UR and stayed at the new Grand Hyatt Baha Mar. Also used a club room cert to get access to the club lounge. I love free food. Another beautiful property and nice pools. Though wasn’t worth 40k points for the weekend.
Oslo & Bergen October 2017 | Cash flight on Norweign JFK-OSL and SAS BGO-OSL, **25k Merrill** points on TAP Portugal J OSL-LIS-JFK | Went on a trip with new churning friends. One of them found the cheap J fare from OSL-LIS-JFK on TAP Portugal, now we just have to made our way to OSL. We blew $300 each at Maaemo, a 3 michelin star restaurant. That was delicious. Drove our way up to Bergen from OSL, great views along the way. Took a flight back to OSL from BGO and flew back on TAP Portugal J. TAP was ok, nothing really to be excited about.
Singapore & Maldives November 2017 | **120k SQ miles** on SQ Suites, JFK-FRA-SIN. Cash at Marina Bay Sands. **15k Avois** SIN-CMB-MLE. **205.5k SPG** points at St. Regis Maldives. $100 flight MLE-DXB-JFK on Emirates | Sometime during 2017, Emirates had a mistake fare for MLE-JFK. Friend and I took advantage of that. He was jealous I went to the Maldives and the one way I’m going back is if I can get the St. Regis. Good thing for still living at home, I took advantage of my family(with their consent) a built up a stash of SPG points. Booked 3 nights overwater villa at 58.5k a night over Thanksgiving. No more availability for extra nights but cash and points were available for a garden villa for $300/15k points a night. Spent 5 days in the Maldives but shitty weather. Backtracking a bit, since I was transitting through Singapore, I wanted to try a fly SQ suites again. I didn’t get off the waitlist until 5 days before. I was adamant to take advantage of everything on the flight but I ended up sleeping through most of it. Met up with my friend in Singapore and we spent a night at Marina Bay Sands. Pool was beautiful but shitty weather.
Brussels & Paris December 2017/NYE | **60k Skypesos** JFK-BRU RT | This was my last trip for the year and I wanted to do NYE in another city. Figured lets go to Europe. Found a 60k flight RT, JFK-BRU. I didn’t want to spend all my time in BRU and so I went down to Paris for NYE. Stayed at a hostel, made some friends and partied into NYE. Went back to Brussels for a night and flew out.
Jamaica Jan 2018 | **15k Jetblue miles**, JFK-MBJ. Cash flight back. **2 Free night at Hyatt** Zilara Rosehall | This time my friend comes through. He got 2 free hyatt nights as well and wanted to go to another Zilara so we can pig out. I moved over enough points to cover one night so we’d get 3 nights. Got upgraded to a large Butler Suite. Property overall was not impressive. The jerk chicken and french restaurant was nice but thats about it. The pools were cold af. Would not come back here.


Overall, 2017 was my best year living life. Even though I traveled for mostly freeish, my bank account hurts. 

**Notes**

- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends, usually Thur-Tues. I also transferred over a decent amount of vacation days in Jan 2017 which helped out alot.

- Still living at home, which helps my bank account and I run through all our bills through my cards.

- Player 2 and half of 3 with family members, which helped me alot

- Still have 500k UR, 170K AA, 130k Skypesos, 100k SPG, 170k MR and others

- Looking to build up my points stash on my extra players in 2018.

- Itching to book another flight/trip. Really want to fly EY apartments."
171,Delta Sky Clubs in LAX/PHX worth $29 for guest?,1,bxvxab,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bxvxab/delta_sky_clubs_in_laxphx_worth_29_for_guest/,21,2019-06-07 19:27:41,"My wife and I will have layovers of 1:50 at LAX and 2:56 at PHX next month. My Platinum card will get me access to the Sky Clubs, as we are flying Delta, but I'm curious what people think of the lounges and whether they're worth paying the extra amount for guest access.

I also have Priority Pass (with restaurant access), so other options would be as follows:

LAX - Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse; Alaska Lounge. (I believe Terminal 1 isn't accessible airside so Rock & Brews is out, and the KAL Lounge and PF Changs won't be open when we're there.)

PHX - the temporary/future Centurion Lounge

How would you spend your time?"

We are open to doing it either immediately after the wedding (so starting around 10/15), or sometime after, even November or December.

We had initially been talking about someplace tropical that we’ve never been, e.g. French Polynesia, but we are also potentially open to a more active trip somewhere around Europe.

Based on our points collection I was wondering if anyone could recommend some possible ideas to start looking at? We have a good amount of points between the two of us across multiple programs and we’re willing to splurge on this trip. below is a list of all points (1st listed are mine, and 2nd listed if any are hers).

* Chase UR (CSR): 234k + 105k (I might add another 80k in the next few months via Ink Business)
* Amex MR: 55k
* Aadvantage: 172k + 68k
* BA Avios: 89k + 70k
* Delta Skymiles: 49k 
* JetBlue: 13k + 37k
* United MileagePlus: 123k 
* Hyatt: 50k + 23k
* Marriott: 62k + 70k
* Hilton: 2k + 22k

We would be flying out of Boston Logan.

Thanks in advance!

**Edit:** thanks for the responses so far, will reply to specific posts but just to clarify, we probably aren’t interested in the Caribbean since we’ve been a few times already (and just got back from a cruise) - we’ve been to St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Martin, Anguilla, Antigua, St. Thomas, St. John, Haiti, Aruba, San Juan, and probably a couple others I’m forgetting."
173,Kauai Trip Report 2017,31,79xqny,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/79xqny/kauai_trip_report_2017/,20,2017-10-31 22:26:59,"Found myself booking a last minute, 5 night, Labor Day weekend trip to Hawaii.

 Stayed 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort. This hotel is absolutely stunning right from the [entrance](http://imgur.com/a/zsqYv) with several pools, a lazy river, a man made beach, as well as access to the resorts own private beach, tennis courts, spa and gym, as well as several other amenities. [Here are some pics of the above mentioned areas](https://imgur.com/a/HvIIj)

[A drone pic I took of the resort](http://imgur.com/a/mwHaA)

Because I took advantage of the Hyatt to MLife back to Hyatt match I was able to get the explorist benefits. They were very nice upgrading us to an ocean room, complementary valet, free breakfast buffet, and so on... 

As for the rental car, since I took part in that glitch several months ago with Hertz Presidents Circle, I got upgraded to an amazing SS Camaro Fifty edition convertible for the price of an economy car and could not be happier! [Car Pics](https://imgur.com/a/7ikg2) and heres a [drone shot of us driving](https://imgur.com/a/rxasu)

As for flights booked through Korean Air with Delta for First class (only flight available since I booked last minute). After reading online about the aircraft Delta would be using I was not so excited as it was just a standard recliner and read that it would be a drop down entertainment system but was shocked to see the first class cabin to look somewhat new, with a built in TV, and of course very comfortable. My wife's seat would not recline, her TV was glitchy, and they forgot our meal so I tweeted Delta and they offered 25k miles each or $200 voucher. Ended up getting 90k back in DL points by complaining via twitter and then sending in a complaint form online through their portal for both my wife and I.

 Here are [pics of the cabin](http://imgur.com/a/okMBC)


We spent the Friday & Saturday at the resort the whole time and Sunday, through the rest of the trip, is when we explored the the wonderful Island and ended up barely spending any time at the resort! We rented snorkeling gear and stopped at several of the beaches as we drove throughout the Island over the course of the next few days:
 
[Poipu Beach](https://imgur.com/a/vZSsG)- Beautiful beach right by the resort that has a wonderful array of fish and is suitable for beginner snorkels 

Waileu Beach- Great place for beginner snorkels as well. Crowded but very fun and a good place to bring kids.

[Lawai Beach](https://imgur.com/a/imblq) - Definitely felt as though this beach was for someone who has at least gone snorkeling a couple of times.  The waves were a bit stronger here but this where we sighted several massive sized turtles.

[Ka’e Beach](https://imgur.com/a/62C1C) - Beautiful beach all the way at one of the ends of the island. Stunning views of the mountain side and ocean. Difficult to get a parking spot.

[Polihale beach](https://imgur.com/a/YdoX0) - was fine to drive with the Camaro... A bit annoying and bumpy but definitely doable. Besides that, it was an amazing sunset view and definitely a place to drive out to.

We of course visited the [queens bath](https://imgur.com/a/CYlFy), [Waimea canyon](https://imgur.com/a/jZacj) (absolutely stunning), [Wailua River Water Falls](https://imgur.com/a/qSX7r), and other attractions throughout the island. 

To save on food we purchased a toaster oven from Costco..., and the typical groceries from the stores in the area and for some days just made and heated up food.

Points breakdown:

Flights: 45k each Roundtrip with Delta First Class LAX-->LIH

Hotel: 25k (Category 6) each night at Grand Hyatt Kauai for a total of 5 nights

Car Rental: $125 for 3 days with a convertible class car
Minus the 90k I received from Delta and the 25k points from Hyatt for tweeting them a picture of a roach in our room.

P.S. First time writing one of these so sorry about any misformating or any other mistakes :) Also, I am in no way a photographer so keep that in mind (especially when you see the stills I attempted to take from the drone videos)!

I am planning a trip to Japan in 6 months and looking to save money on the flight cost with upgrading our seats from Economy to either Economy Plus or Business Class.

I put together a few ideas that would help me earn enough points, but wanted to run it by the pros on here in case I am missing something or can improve. Btw, I currently have a Cahse Sapphire Reserve and some extra miles from Delta on a recent trip I took.

\- Signed up for membership on All Nippon airways \(ANA\)

\- Can sign up for New Marriot Rewards Card, can receive 100,000 points with $5k purchases

\- Wondering if I can transfer my Sapphire Reserve Points \(11,800\) to the Marriot Rewards Card then transfer 100,000 points \+ 11,800 points to ANA as marriot is a flight partner.

Any other tips, suggestions please let me know thanks!

Our trip is in April of next year, and we're going to Qatar, Jordan, and Israel over 12 days.  Thank you again to you folks here at /r/awardtravel for the great ideas and inspiration.  This is the first award trip I've been able to put together where we actually depart and return to the same airport.  Wonderfully, it's also our home airport: JFK.

**\*\*Points Used:\*\***

* 175,000 AA
* 150,000 IHG
* 170,000 Delta

**\*\*Flights\*\***

Compared to some of my other award booking experiences in the past (Japan, South-East Asia, India, France) booking these flights was a complete breeze.  Getting what I really wanted, however, was a different story.  I had loads of AA miles, and searching for space was simple on their website.  I found two seats on Qatar airways in Qsuites J on their new A350-1000 for 70k miles and minor taxes per person.  Flights leave from JFK and arrive to Doha the next morning.

Here's where I don't get my way.  The wife and I wanted to see Qatar, but didn't want to spend a lot of time there, so I endeavored to find a flight going from Doha to Amman, Jordan that left within 24 hours of our arrival.  American routing rules only allow for a 24-hour stopover on the same award ticket.   There are multiple oneworld carriers leaving from Doha to Amman every morning, but the timing was 26 or 27 hours after we landed, so they wouldn't be allowed by AA.  I did find one flight that left 24 hours and 20 minutes after we landed, and tried tried tried tried to get AA to allow it, but they wouldn't budge.  24 hours is 24 hours.   I ended up spending 17.5k points pp to book us on one of the next morning flights in Y for the 2.5 hour flight.  I considered cash rates, but they were VERY high - \~$900 for just the one-way for two people.  Points made more sense.

For our flights home, we were leaving from Israel - I easily found space on Virgin Atlantic from Tel Aviv to London to JFK in Upper Class for 85,000 miles and $70 per person.  The flight from London to JFK is slotted to be on their new A350-1000 as well, so I'm excited to try that!  I looked into finding non-stops, but there appeared to be only three carriers doing it: United (which I didn't want to spend my UR on this), Delta (which cost 350k points per person), and El Al (which only transfers with MR for the horrible rate of 20:1000).

**\*\*Hotels\*\***

My wife and I ended up booking most of our hotels with cash, as the rates this early before the trip were very reasonable.   Most nice hotels in the three countries we're going to didn't end up being more than $200 a night, the two exceptions being the Four Seasons Doha and Amman.

The points exception, however, was the Intercontinental David Tel Aviv - I actually got these points by cancelling an Intercontinental stay in Osaka that I had booked in a previous post, and had a few work stays in Kimptons and Indigos between then and now.  The award rate was 50k points per night, and cash rates were over $400, so it felt like a great deal!  The total cost was 200k, but IHG has the ""4th night free"" promotion on reward bookings, so it was only 150k points out of pocket.

We're looking forward to trying falconry in Qatar, camping in the desert in Wadi Rum, seeing Jerusalem, swimming in the Dead Sea, walking around Petra, and exploring all the amazing food!  Can't wait to come back with a trip report.

Thank you again, /r/awardtravel \- this will be a great trip and it's possible from all the good advice to be found on this sub."

5 months ago, I posted about my trip to Asia primarily using points on flights and hotel. Many of you requested I come back and share what I liked/disliked. If you want to see photos from my trip, you can see the [Imgur album here](https://imgur.com/gallery/uFejV)

Here's what I did: 

So here is the trip:

**San Francisco to Manila** (with a layover in Hong Kong)

* Cathay Pacific Business
* 49,500 AA points (I booked pre-devaluation, with 10% return thanks to my AA card)
* **Review:** Freaking amazing. I've flown Cathay First Class before, but I really enjoyed the Business a lot more. In first class, I got bothered by all the attention the attendants would give you. Because it's only 6 seats, you go from ""oh wow this is amazing"" to ""yeah, I shouldn't be here"" reaaaal quick. I believe Business Class is the perfect combination of luxury travel, comfort, and privacy. 10/10 would blow points on this route again. 



**Manila to Seoul** 

* Asiana Airlines Economy
* 20,000 UA points
* **Review:** The Korean food was awful. I think I definitely could have done this route more efficiently. 



**Seoul to Singapore**

* Singapore Economy
* 19,125 SQ points (15% back by booking online)
* **Review:**This was an overnight flight, so I didn't get a chance to enjoy it. With that said, I think Incheon Airport and Changi Airport are two of my favorite airports.
* **Review of Chic Capsule Hostel:** Really friendly staff, clean ""capsules"" (essentially bunk beds with curtains), great location, but oddly same-sex shower rooms.



**Singapore to Kuala Lumpur**

* ~~Overnight train~~ Low-cost carrier. By this point in my trip (1.5 months in), I got tired of carrying all the luggage, so I decided to go for a low-cost carrier.
* 6 nights in the Hilton Double Tree KL
* 49,800 Hilton points (5th night free, Diamond status)
* **Review:** Oh my, this was definitely the BEST hotel I've ever stayed in. I got upgrade to Deluxe Suite for the first time. Just incredible service, solid breakfast in the executive lounge, decent location (with a food court in the bottom of the mall), and an amazing view of the Petronas Towers). This was when I became a Hotel Status believer. Unfortunately, there's not much to do in Kuala Lumpur.



**Kuala Lumpur to Chiang Mai**

* Low-cost flight
* 8 nights in the Holiday Inn
* 80,000 IHG points (10% rebate eventually)
* **Review:** Wasn't a huge fan. It's really far away from all the action in Chiang Mai, so it requires you to take an Uber everywhere. I thought the Check-In lady was really rude, the kind of people who will say nice things to you in English but say something nasty in their own native tongue. Definitely won't come back here again, as housing prices are dirt cheap in Chiang Mai.



**Chiang Mai to Bangkok**

* Low-cost flight
* 6 nights in the Hilton Double Tree Bangkok (5th night is free)
* 99,600 Hilton points
* **Review:** Couldn't get upgraded to suite, but I did get upgraded to a Deluxe Room. The breakfast at this hotel was amazing and the hotel itself was solid, nothing special. The DoubleTree in Kuala Lumpur really set the bar for DoubleTrees, so I was expecting more from this property, since it cost double the points. Probably wouldn't come back here. If you have some Hilton Points to spend, Bangkok has several properties that I hear are better than the DoubleTree.



**Bangkok to Siem Reap**

* Low-cost flight
* 2 nights at Siem Reap Hostel
* $20
* **Review:** Awesome experience, informative staff, and fair prices on everything. Great food, too!



**Siem Reap to Ho Chi Minh, then HCM to Hanoi**

* Low-cost flights
* 6 nights in Garden Inn Hanoi
* 49,800 Hilton points (5th night free)
* **Review:** Got upgraded to a suite again! Thank you Diamond Status. Really enjoyed my trip here. The staff were friendly, the food was great, though the gym was really small. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed Hanoi and this hotel was close to some amazing restaurants. 



**Hanoi to Taipei**

* China Airlines Economy
* 10,000 Flying Blue points + fuel surcharge
* **Review:** To be honest, I don't remember anything about this flight. 



**Taipei to Manila**

* ~~Low-cost flight~~ Used the Chase Travel Portal to book a $100 Philippine Airline flight for 7.8k UR. I wish I had the CSR, but at 1.25ppc, it was my best option to fly back into Manila. A semi-decent redemption in my book.
* **Quick note:** I wish I had the Prestige during my trip to Palawan, Philippines. It would have saved me some money when redemption wasn't available. If the card drops to a $350 annual fee, I might consider applying within the next few years.



**Manila to Tokyo**

* Japan Airlines Economy
* 10,000 Avios Points
* **Review:** I HATE JAL's web check-in process (British Airways re-directed me to their site). It really discourages you from flying what otherwise would be an amazing airline. Thankfully, I got a window seat and caught [one of my favorite shots of this trip](https://i.imgur.com/j6vlHH1.jpg).



**Tokyo to Honolulu**

* Japan Airlines Economy
* 20,000 Avios Points + $60
* **Review:** Though it was an overnight fly from 11pm, they still served an awesome meal. JAL, from my experience on these two flights, have amazing meals. 



**Honolulu to LAX**

* Delta Airlines Economy 
* 15,000 Flying Blue points
* **Review:** People hate Delta for some reason, but I think this flight had the best service of this entire trip. All the stewardesses and crew-members were so friendly.


And that's it! If you have any questions, please let me know :)

Happy churning!"

We are planning on taking the trip later this year (maybe fall), however need to close the card in the next few months.

I was thinking of transferring them to Delta even though 1:1 transfer right now (since miles don't expire?) or Hilton (10% bonus, but not sure will be staying at Hilton owned property, so not the best choice).

Anything else I should consider in the next few months before just transferring to airline or hotel partner? No set dates yet, so can't commit/book anything.

Location: I live in Tucson, Arizona (TUS). Flying out of PHX is an option and I can drive to LAX if the deal is good enough. 

Points: ~100k AA, ~40k Delta

I have done some reading on the basics via the wiki and posts here as well as a smattering of blog posts. I've never flown business or first in my life and would probably be happy to travel coach but I figure with this much time to plan and prepare I could really make it a trip to remember. 

I'm aware of the amazing ANA F West Coast-Tokyo option through Virgin Atlantic. However, my existing points are all in other Alliance groups. 

I feel like one decision I need to make immediately is whether to plan on opening two new credit cards in 2019 in order to amass the points necessary to do the ANA option with Virgin Atlantic, or if I should work with what I have and research competing options. 

If anyone has any opinions or suggestions on other things I should be thinking of right for a trip next year, I would love to benefit from your expertise. 

Thank you!"

**American:** ~300k
**Alaska:** 36k + Companion Pass
**Amex MR:** 225k
**Chase UR:** 205k
**Delta:** 176k (will probably get another 64k or 75k via new Delta card)
**Southwest:** 27k (won't have CP anymore but GF will probably have earned hers by then + 110k)

**Home airport:** ORD/MDW
**Length of Trip:** ~2 weeks.

Here are the countries I am interested in but don't need to go to all of them, the only one I definitely want to go to is Greece.

Countries: Greece, Morocco, Italy, Portugul, Croatia, France, Italy, Denmark

It would be nice to make it to 3 of them.

Questions:

1) I see booking one-way flights causes high taxes/fees for the return flight. Is there a way to avoid this or do I have to book RT to avoid it? I ask because I'd like to use up my Delta miles first.

2) Would spending ~3-4 days in 3 countries be a good amount of time?

3) Would using points for a ticket to the 1st country and then buying cheap flights to travel between them be the better idea?"

Flights are SEA-CDG, returning AMS-SEA, 100k + $51 RT per person which seems like a pretty good deal for a $3k cash fare.

Delta flies a 767-300 on SEA-CDG... but on AMS-SEA they have 2x daily, one the 767 and the other the A330.  From what I've read, the seats are very different and the Delta One product is superior on the A330, so I would prefer to be on that flight for the AMS return to at least try the other seat.

Virgin Atlantic is showing scattered availability for AMS-SEA, sometimes on the 767 flight, sometimes on A330, or both depending on the date.  On our preferred dates it's only showing availability on the 767 flight.  Searching on Delta's site, the 2 flights that day are the same cash fare and similarly empty at this point.

Is there any way to book the 767 flight and ultimately get our tickets changed to the same day's A330 flight by calling Delta or anything like that?

Any other suggestions/ideas are welcome."

Final piece locked in today!  I posted in the r/churning thread a few weeks ago but wanted to post here to get some more commentary. Here it goes!

Flights first:

**Flight leg 1: MSP-ORD-HKG-SIN**

MSP-ORD: AA domestic F on a 738.  Plan is to hit the AA Flagship lounge while waiting in ORD.

ORD-HKG: CX F on a 773.  Wife is booked in CX J, and patiently waiting for F space to open.  Fingers crossed.  We have a ~5 hour layover in HKG, so looking forward to the CX F lounges.

HKG-SIN: CX J (no F on this route) on a A330

*Total: 2x110k AA miles = 220k AA miles + ~$100 IIRC*


**Flight leg 2: SIN-MEL-ZQN**

SIN-MEL: SQ J on a 772. Overnight flight.

MEL-ZQN: NZ Y on an A320.  Meh, but the sights should be decent.  I don't think biz was an option on this route

*Total: 2x50k UA miles = 100k UA miles + $103*


**Flight leg 3: ZQN-SYD-AUH**

ZQN-SYD: QF Y on a 738.  Meh again... gets the job done.  23 hour ""layover"" in Sydney (on purpose, of course)

SYD-AUH:  EY F Apartments on the A380. Very excited for this one for obvious reasons.  Not sure if we will bus over to Dubai or stay in Abu Dhabi.  Opinions welcome.  We'll have 2 nights wherever we end up.

*Total: 2x100k AA miles = 200k AA miles + ~$200*


**Flight leg 4: AUH-AMS**

AUH-AMS: EY J on an A330.  Day flight, lounge experience will be nice in AUH.

*Total: 2x42.5k AA miles = 85k AA miles + $60*


**Flight leg 5: AMS-MSP**

AMS-MSP: DL J on an A330.  Very worth it to go nonstop for the final leg of our trip.  Could have saved some money by mustering up some more AA miles and doing something like AMS-PHL-MSP, but I figure by this point we'll be exhausted and just want to get home.  Fees were ~$500 on this flight, so I used my stash of DL GCs to offset most of the cost.

*Total: 2x70k DL miles = 140k AA miles + ~$500 (minus $350 in DL GCs)*

***Total total:***

All AA miles (505k) were from AA card churning (65k mailers w/ 75k match).  All DL miles (140k) from Delta Platinum Biz+Personal.  All UA miles (100k) from wife's CIP + my referral to her.

.
.

Now hotels:

**Singapore**
Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights.  Paying cash from 2 x WF Biz Plat.


**Queenstown, NZ**
Crowne Plaza Queenstown for 4 nights - 150k IHG points for the 50k/night (4th night free with the new IHG cards).  Not many award hotels in this area, and prices (including Airbnb) are all-around insane for this time of year.  Crowne was ~$400/night if paying cash.  There was a Holiday Inn a few miles up the road for 20k/night, but we wanted to be within walking distance of everything.


**Sydney**
Park Hyatt Sydney overlooking the Sydney Opera House for 1 night - 30k WoH points.  If we're gonna do Sydney for one night, might as well make it special.


**Abu Dhabi OR Dubai**
Undecided here, but have lots of Marriott points to burn.  Looking for recommendations.  Currently have a decent Marriott booked in Dubai for 2 nights.


**Amsterdam**
Renaissance Marriott for 2 nights.  We've stayed here before and loved the hotel and location.  Wanted to end the trip somewhere comfortable and familiar.



Total is 16 days - a lot to pack in, but we're excited and ready.  The original intent of this trip was to do just Singapore and Queenstown, but the availability back from South Pacific was abysmal... so turned the trip into a RTW!

This is for a trip that I just completed last week.

My wife and I loved our trip to the Conrad Maldives last year so we decided we wanted to go back and the timing of marriott/SPG merger worked out well for us.

We booked BUF - DCA - JFK - AUH - MLE in First for 105K miles each.  Our flight from AUH - MLE ended up being downgraded to Business from First after a substantial delay due to a maintenance issue and were switched to a 2 cabin flight.  The crew was great and still treated us like first class and we were placed in the 2 front seats of the business class cabin.  Due to the switch, my wife and I eached received a voucher for $200 cash that we were able to redeem back in Abu Dhabi.  Due to delay and arriving in Male at 6 PM, we missed our seaplane so we ended up booking the Hotel Octave in Male for $97 and I would highly recommend this for a quick layover.  They provide RT airport transfer with free breakfast and the facilities are clean and get the job done.  For the layover in Abu Dhabi, I booked the Andaz Abu Dhabi using a free Hyatt certificate.

We were originally booked at the W Maldives for 5 nights but only ended up being there for 4 nights and the staff was great.  The reservation was booked under my wife's account but they honored my platinum status for free breakfast and 35% off all food and beverages.  We spent 340K Marriott points to book into an overwater villas.  The snorkeling here is fantastic and if that is what you like to do, I would highly recommend this property.  Our cost at the resort were as follows:

Seaplane transfer - $950 - $200 since we used Amex Blue Cash bonus to cover minimum spend on this. 
Snorkeling Excursion - $246
2 Shirts - $52
Food & Drinks - $420

We were able to get on the last seaplane leaving the resort and flew business class on Etihad from Male - Abu Dhabi for 27K AA miles.  The flight attendant that was assigned to my section was not very attentive and basically ignored me throughout the flight.  

We spent the night in Abu Dhabi at the Intercontental Abu Dhabi on a cash rate of $90.  The next morning we went to the Emirates Palace for ""breakfast"".  For $48, my wife got the famous Palace Cappuccino and I got the old topped ice cream cone.

We then took a cab from Abu Dhabi to Al Maha, which cost $95 before tip and $120 including tip.  We spent 2 nights at Al Maha which I found to be an all around amazing property.  The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in.  We spent 120K Marriott points and this propery is all inclusive for meals and 2 activities per day.  We did have some out of pocket cost thought which are as follows:

Spa Treatments: $356 including tip
Bar Drinks: $52
Car Service to Abu Dhabi: $200 including tip

We flew Abu Dhabi to JFK in Etihad business class for 63K AA miles and JFK to BUF on Delta for 6K miles each.

Total Miles/Points Used:

American Airlines: 390K
Marriott BonVoy: 460K
1 Free Hyatt Certificate
Delta: 12K 

The total cash outlay for this trip was just over $2800 counting taxes and fee on awards.  When you factor in the $200 bonus, $400 Etihad vouchers and each of our $300 Marriott card credits - we only spent $1600.  

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this and I would be happy to answer any questions that you have.

**When**: March/April 2018

**Length**: ~10 days

**Airport**: ORD (but will fly out of JFK to get a better plane)

**Point Balances**:

* UR: 300k

* MR: 215k

* SPG: 130k

* AA: 315k (with 70k coming in the next month or so)

* Delta: 178k (with 65k on the way in a week or two)


1) I want to use AA miles to fly there. I should easily have enough for 2x RT Business class tickets. However, I see my options are Cathay Pacific and Qatar. How do they compare? Any reason to choose one over the other?

2) Is 10 days in Bali a good length of time? We also talked about doing Bali + Thailand and making the trip longer. If we did that, would just buy a cheap flight between the countries (via UR portal).

3) Is staying at 1 hotel the whole time a good idea? I have ~130k SPG points, 300k UR. I notice a lot of the SPG properties are really nice and barely over $130/night but cost like 10k points/night, to me that doesn't seem worth it to use points. Any suggestions?

4) Is Bali really cheap as far as food, activities, etc. go?

5) Any other advice?

I'm having trouble finding a good milesaaver business award redemption for 2 from Spain/Portugal to the US. My dates are relatively flexible - looking for a 14-17 day trip between 15 May and 13 June. I have 118k AA pts.

So far, I have found a good outgoing flight on Delta, so really looking for a return flight. However, I would be willing to switch based on availability. I am specifically looking to fly from MAD, LIS, or BCN to CRW, LEX, CMH or CVG. There is *no* business award availability on Iberia through the BA website through that time period, either inbound or outbound. I've searched MAD - MIA, JFK, ORD, and BOS. AA has some pretty good flights for 110k/135k pts each that go direct MAD - CLT or similar, but all of the ones at 57.5k are shitty and go through LHR.

For example, flying from MAD - CRW (my home airport), I would have to fly MAD - LHR, LHR - IAD, stay OVERNIGHT in DC, then DCA - CRW.

I have found one route that puts me overnight at LHR, which sounds like it could be fun to get out and explore London for a night (I've never been), but not sure it would be worth it.

The best routing I've really found so far has been LIS - LHR, LHR - JFK, JFK - CLT, CLT - CRW. Luckily this one is same day, but 21 hours of travel time. ~$700 in taxes.

I've looked at other nearby airports like LEX, CVG, CMH and haven't gotten any luckier.

I think I really just wanted to complain to people who would understand, but if anyone has any suggestions about how to improve my search, I would greatly appreciate it."

That seems pretty standard. That is about 2x the retail price, and that is the pretty standard markup for restaurants that sell a lot of wine. I do not know what the wholesale price is. I'm guessing somewhere between $60 and $80.

&#x200B;

What surprised me is that you also have the option of redeeming 12,500 Skymiles for the same bottle. That is $125 worth of Delta Miles, if you use the pay by miles option. This seems strange to me. You would think that they would prefer people pay cash, and there would be an incentive to pay cash, but they're letting you have the same bottle for half price if you use their proprietary dollars that cannot be spent elsewhere.

&#x200B;

Why would Delta do this? Is it a thing where they are just trying to reward loyal customers who have a lot of Skymiles. Or is it possible that they are trying to get people to redeem their Skymiles for things other than flights, because reward point flights are a big loss leader? I'm really stumped here if anyone is in the know."

I am super, super flexible with where I fly out of, and where I fly back to the US from. If I need to fly from Tokyo or Shanghai to save points, that is totally fine. I am excited to see any parts of Asia, really. Thanks for the help."
201,47k DA miles or $461,1,8on1r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/8on1r7/47k_da_miles_or_461/,19,2018-06-05 06:00:15,"Should I book with 47k Delta miles or $461 cash? This values DA at 1cpp. I know this is very subjective question and varies from person to person, but I'd just like to hear some opinions.

I've checked awardhacker and this is the best route. There's a chance I'll use the DA miles in the next 12 months, but I'm not sure as of now.

202,Advice for booking business/first Boston to Tokyo in late 2019,0,ayl7et,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/ayl7et/advice_for_booking_businessfirst_boston_to_tokyo/,19,2019-03-08 05:47:32,"Hi all- we are getting married in mid-October, and we are tossing around the idea of Japan for our honeymoon. I started doing a bunch of research about ways to book business or first with miles/points but am getting pretty overwhelmed, hoping someone may be able to steer me in the right direction. 

We have points spread across a number of different programs, listed below, broken down by mine (P1) vs hers.

Basically we are looking for: 

* Boston to Tokyo R/T
* Business or First
* approx. 11-15 days total
* Earliest possible date we could leave is ~10/16/2019; we’d consider anytime Nov/Dec, possibly Jan, depending on availability, pricing etc, but preference is late Oct / early-mid Nov
* We would plan to travel around Japan, rather than spending the full 2 weeks in Tokyo. But I assume Tokyo round trip is much more economical than open jaw?

Program | P1 | P2
-: | :- | :-
Chase UR | 328k | 218k
Amex MR | - | 60k
AAdvantage | 172k | 69k
BA Exec Club | 155k | -
Delta | 42k | 4k 
United | 123k | -
Southwest | 43k | -
JetBlue | 15k | 38k
Hyatt | 51k | 23k
Hilton | 5k | 20k
Marriott | 62k | 70k

Can anyone provide some guidance as to what I should be looking for, the best way(s) to search for availability, or any other general tips? Since there aren’t as many direct Boston to Tokyo flights, am I better off searching for award bookings from other cities, e.g. Chicago or LA to Tokyo, to get a better idea of actual cost of the main leg? Also I noticed that a lot of possible Bus/First flights I found were deceptive since the short leg, e.g. BOS-ORD was first but ORD-NRT was Economy. Are there other ways to weed those out? But I wouldn’t mind flying Economy on legs within the US (and am not opposed to 1-stop itineraries)

Or, would you recommend using some sort of award booking service to assist us with all this? 

Also we are both 3/24 for Chase and are willing to apply for new cards, Biz or personal. I might end up going for the SW Companion Pass (already got the personal Rewards Plus), though I know that wouldn’t help with a Japan trip. 

Thanks in advance."

I’m expecting a 10K MQM bump at the end of the year for my delta credit card and may go on an international trip to reach diamond status (tbd). If I don’t, I’ll fall short of the MQM threshold. If I do, I’ll be very close and may just need a small mileage run. 

I have a personal trip coming up where I can pay $200 or use 17.5K miles (I have 320K). I would earn 1000 MQM.  Is it dumb that I’m thinking about paying $200 out of pocket for 1000 MQM?"

209,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Citi TYPs,33,49tcba,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tcba/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_citi_typs/,19,2016-03-10 16:07:03,"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/) and my [post on getting to Europe using Chase URs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbx6/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_chase_urs/), I tried to do this overview including MRs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Citi TYPs***

Citi offers a few cards that earn ThankYou Points, including their ThankYou Premier card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for travel and gas). Citi offers a few other card options that earn TYPs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Citi’s website and check out the options.

Your TYPs will transfer to 12 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your TYPs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since Cathay Pacific operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be lower than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. FlyingBlue is definitely going to be your best option for a SkyTeam partner redemption and is a good choice in general for a coach redemption – though unless you are dead set on flying a SkyTeam partner airline, it is not going to be your best bet for a premium cabin redemption. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Garuda Indonesia**

Garuda Indonesia’s GarudaMiles program uses a distance based award chart, so your redemption cost will depend on your home airport. Garuda Indonesia is part of the SkyTeam alliance which means you can redeem your GarudaMiles for Air France, KLM, Alitalia, Delta, Czech Airlines or Garuda Indonesia (on their 5th freedom route from Amsterdam (AMS) to London (LGW)) flights.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~75k miles for coach and ~135k miles for business class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~85k miles for coach and ~150k miles for business class.

Although the redemption rates may not be horrible, the process for obtaining your award ticket is probably the worst I have ever seen. First you need to call the Garuda Indonesia call center at 021.2351.9999 to place your award ticket on hold. Then you need to download and complete an award ticket application form which you must take to a Garuda Indonesia sales office, in person, and then go back to the ticket office, in person, to claim your award ticket. So how many sales offices does Garuda Indonesia have in the US? Four. Yes, you read that right. Four. Encino, California, Chicago, Houston and New York.

In short, avoid Garuda Indonesia like the plague for award tickets unless you happen to live in or very near Encino, Chicago, Houston or New York and do not mind doing a ton of legwork.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your TYPs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Malaysia Airlines**

Malaysia Airlines’ Enrich program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Malaysia Airlines is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Enrich miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~54k miles roundtrip for coach, ~96k miles roundtrip for business class and ~132k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~72k miles roundtrip for coach, ~132k miles roundtrip for business class and ~192k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

While the redemption rates are actually generally not horrible, there have been a lot of reports of people experiencing issues when transferring their TYPs to the Enrich program. I would generally steer clear of transferring your TYPs to the Enrich program until Malaysia Airlines gets their IT department up to speed and fixes these issues.

**Qantas**

Qantas’ Frequent Flyer program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qantas is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe. Qantas also partners with Aer Lingus, so you can also fly them on a partner award ticket!

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~70k miles roundtrip for coach, 105k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~130k miles roundtrip for business class and ~190k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~84k miles roundtrip for coach, ~126k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~156k miles roundtrip for business class and ~228k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Remember that you will be charged for carrier imposed surcharges, which means avoid British Airways and Iberia flights for the trans-Atlantic segment if you can!

Qantas’ redemption costs are fairly high, so unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qantas miles that you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe as the Qantas redemptions rates are not very good.

**Qatar**

Qatar’s Qmiles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qatar is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~75k miles roundtrip for coach, ~112.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~150k miles roundtrip for business class and ~225k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip for coach, ~127.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~170k miles roundtrip for business class and ~255k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Again, and as with Qantas, unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qmiles you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe.

**EVA Air**

EVA Air is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Infinity miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 68k miles for coach, 105k miles for business class and 170k miles for first class.

EVA Air requires that you make your Star Alliance award ticket booking through their reservation office. With that said, considering that Singapore Airlines has access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that EVA Air has, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines for a coach or first class redemption. If you are looking for a business class award ticket, you are better off transferring your TYPs to EVA instead of Singapore Airlines.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Thai Airways**

Thai Airways is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Royal Orchid Plus miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 70k miles for coach, 125k miles for business class and 160k miles for first class.

Keep in mind that Thai Airways charges fuel surcharges as well on award tickets, and from all reports I have seen, they are exorbitant. Considering that Singapore Airlines and EVA should both have access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that Thai Airways has access to, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines or EVA (if you want a business class award ticket) for this redemption unless you have a huge stash of Royal Orchid Plus miles that you are looking to burn and you do not mind paying exorbitant surcharges.

**Etihad**

Although Etihad is not a part of any major airline alliance, they do have several strategic partnerships with airlines such as Air Berlin, Alitalia, Czech Airlines and Brussels Airlines. Unfortunately, you are not able to redeem your Guest Miles for award tickets on these airlines. Etihad’s Guest Miles program is a dynamic program that has so many variables in its pricing structure that I could not possibly address all the possibilities here. I would instead recommend that you go to their mileage calculator and plug in your information to determine your mileage redemption rates.

For reference though, most of your flights are going to run well over 100k miles for a coach award ticket, so I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere to transfer your TYPs for a European trip.

u/workthrowaway323 pointed out (thanks!) that you can actually book AA saver level award flights with your Guest Miles. Like AA, Etihad uses a peak/off peak system for economy award tickets. Off-peak dates between the U.S. and Europe are October 15 - May 15. Roundtrip economy redemptions will cost you 40k miles off-peak and 60k miles during peak times, while business class will cost 100k miles and first class will cost 125k miles. To redeem you have to contact the Etihad service center at 888-8ETIHAD ***at least 14 days prior to the intended date of travel***. 

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are quite good, it is important to remember that your TYPs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of TYPs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the second worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your TYPs!"

213,Advice on which programs to credit miles?,0,bnv954,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bnv954/advice_on_which_programs_to_credit_miles/,19,2019-05-13 02:44:07,"Hi all! I'm new here and enjoying learning from you all!

I am an international student from Asia and have been in the US for a few years. Most of my miles are with United (as I thought United has good coverage in the US and great alliance with Asian carriers). However, I've been struggling now as I moved to Philly and most flights are with American or Delta. My goal is to in the future redeem miles for economy flights, mostly within the US or to Asia. I only have Chase UR points, not AMEX or Citi.

Would love to get some advice on how to maintain multiple programs and which programs I should credit my future miles to.

* AA flights: Should I stick with AA or credit to others like Alaska that has partners? I do have \~30k with AA now.
* Delta: Similarly, should I stick with Delta or credit to others? I have only 3k with Delta.
* I have upcoming flights with Virgin Atlantic, Jetblue, and Emirates. This makes me even more confused as they have many partners as well. For example, for Virgin Atlantic, I'm torn between its own program, Delta, or ANA. For Emirates, I'm torn between its own program, Alaska, and JAL.
* I recently found [wheretocredit.com](https://wheretocredit.com) but I still have a hard time comparing programs. Any advice?

Thank you very much!"

I'm about to book 2 trips to Europe on 3 different tickets. Here's what I got so far: The travel dates are from 4/10-4/21, and 11/27-12/8.

28k on Delta, 100k Amex MR, 35k Chase UR, 150k AA + $600 in GC.

The plan is this:

* Use 25k on Delta from LAX -> FCO (April)

* Book a multi-city cash ticket on AA for CDG -> LAX, with a return flight in November. (So that I can use my gift card, approx $1.5-2k)

* LAX -> DUS, Germany (November)

* 57.5k AA miles + $500 in taxes and fees, LHR -> LAX 

I'm not thrilled with this plan, but so far it's the best I got. I want to use my gift cards sooner than later, which is why I'm planning on booking a cash fare. One way tickets are about double the cost of a multi-city ticket, which is where I got the plan to pair up my return flight and departing flight the way I did, despite the timing. 

I'm also not thrilled with paying the $500 taxes, but BA availability suits my schedule best so I don't see a way out of it for now. I was hoping by booking so far out in advance I could get an AA flight or something, but that doesn't seem to be the case. 

I could dip into my MR and UR points, but I want to set them aside for hotels for the time being. 

With all those considerations, how does this redemption look? I know it's not stellar, but it does achieve the goals of using up my gift cards and getting me to the cities I want to be in. 

Edit: Not sure if I'm blind or just a moron, but where do I enter gift card information on the site? I don't see it anywhere? [what I see at the check out page](https://imgur.com/a/qRa8S2O)"

The total added cost for this is the 130$ one way, and 50$ hotel room (splitting with SO).

  
My other option is paying 80k to book ANA through united from my home location, with one stop and one itinerary. Pros and cons? I feel as if saving the 20k miles is worth it because I am traveling with my SO, so it would be 40k miles total saved. Thanks"

Dad has 120k UR, ~28k AA, 26k United, just canceled the AA card recently.  They are expecting 38k SPG each soon.

Seems they have enough for a 1-way on AA or an alliance partner, though availability on AA is pretty barren and may go for J.  Just having a bed would be the main draw.  I keep hearing AA is bad so maybe I'll suggest JAL to Tokyo for a few days before flying Y to PVG.  What route would you recommend?  Could also consider HKG first before PVG.

They haven't gotten the main TY cards yet, Premier/Prestige, and don't have MR either.  Do you guys recommend TYP or MR for the return trip?  They probably won't want to jump through the hoops for the Prestige so may need to combine TYP and MR per ticket."

We were thinking of going to Oahu since it seems like it would be relatively easy to get around with a baby but were wondering if there's any other islands we should look into. We are not planning to go hiking or do any scuba diving. We are mostly looking for good dining, beaches, and sight seeing that can be accessed relatively easily. Also if we could find a hotel that has free breakfast (Marriott/SPG gold or club lounge from SPG biz access) that would be a plus.

222,New York to Nepal - lots of options (and questions about AS miles on CX),1,5tm271,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5tm271/new_york_to_nepal_lots_of_options_and_questions/,19,2017-02-12 18:55:43,"Looking to head out to Nepal for a month later this year, probably booking as two one ways because I don't know how long I'll stay. Preferably doing the whole thing in J but I'd be fine with Y in one direction if it makes more sense. Just myself flying, leaving sometime the end of October/early November. EWR/JFK preferred airports, happy to have multiple long layovers/complex routings.

* 100k BA Avios
* 150k MR
* 40k SPG
* 85k United
* 115k UR

My findings so far:

Economy:

* 40k MR -> Delta/Flying Blue for on Korean through ICN
* 42.5k UA/UR -> United on *A
* 45k BA Avios on Cathay through HKG

Business:

* 75k MR -> Aeroplan on *A (Turkish, maybe others?)
* 80k UR/UA -> United on *A (EVA, Asiana, ANA, Thai, etc.)


Can't do ANA because I don't want to book roundtrip and surcharges are high anyway. JAL is off because I don't have enough SPG to transfer. Can't find any J space for Korean through Delta/FlyingBlue.

So my questions are the following:

* Can I use AS miles to book CX? On the Alaska award chart it suggests it's 30k AS in economy or 35k AS in premium economy but when I called the agent said she could not see any availability from HKG-KTM on any day (even though BA shows availability pretty much every day), so I'm thinking there's something in the routing that prevents booking CX with AS from HKG-KTM?

* The Aeroplan website doesn't show nearly as many options as the United website, and United is showing some awesome options such as EVA/ANA/Asiana J availability. If I call Aeroplan and feed them the flights, will they be able to see them and book them? I just tried calling a couple of times but they are apparently so busy they won't even take my call.

Any other thoughts, suggestions, ideas or recommendations are welcomed! Thanks for helping out - you guys are awesome! :)

A friend is in Austria for a few weeks, and I've been tossing around the idea of going to visit while he's there.  It's not a must that I make this trip, but if I can find a good last minute award fare it would certainly make it more likely.   The days that I travel are fairly flexible to pick saver award availability, I just know I need do it in the next 2\-3 weeks.  I'm pretty well versed with options using United, and have found some decent options with them.  After doing an ANA F last year RT for 93k MR \(VS transfer bonus\), it's just hard for me to pay 70k United miles for 1\-way partner J to Europe.

Are there any ""tricks"" I'm not thinking of?  Thought I had been at this for awhile, but still learning new ways to book \(such as ANA via VS\) so hoping there might be something I'm not aware of to get to Europe on short notice.

Point balances are:

UR 290k

MR 200k

Delta 75k

United 25k

AA 125k

Avios 25k

Edit: I don't necessarily need direct to Austria.  I've looked for availability ORD\-MAD on Iberia using Avios, and Delta via VS to Paris, but given peak season no surprise there isn't anything.  I'm about out of creative ideas, so it may just be United/partners or nothing."

We went last year in early April and this time it was in early May.  Same hotels each time, but we received better rooms this year at each property.  Both islands seemed to be a little less crowded and it appears to be due to the gap between spring break and summer break.  Happy to answer any questions

FLIGHTS
Delta (ATL – LAX – LIH) and (OGG – LAX – ATL) (73,000 Skymiles roundtrip each; wife upgraded to Econ Comfort).  CPP = 1.2
We have flown ATL to HNL nonstop before; however, this was our first time laying over in LAX.  Layover was about an hour and uneventful.  The biggest surprise was that there were 83 open seats on the flight from LAX to LIH.  Many people, myself included, had an entire row to themselves to stretch out.  I can’t remember the last flight I have been on where there were 5 open seats, let alone 80.

Hawaiian (LIH – OGG) ($132 cash each for First)
Easy flight.  First is $40 more than economy and gets free checked bags and a small lounge.  It cost $40 to check two bags in economy, so we booked first for the 45min flight.  The lounge tiny, but it is airconditioned and quiet.

HOTELS
Grand Hyatt Kauai (25,000 Hyatt x 4 nights) CPP = 5.8
We booked as a “guest of honor” which allowed us globalist benefits.  We were upgraded to an ocean front club room on the first floor.  A higher ocean front would have had better views, but I was happy with the view we had.  Being on the first floor was also convenient getting to the pool/beach.  Breakfast in the Grand Club was nice and we enjoyed the light snacks in the afternoon.  Valet fees were also waived, although self-parking is just as convenient.  We were given a bottle of champagne at check in, but never had the chance to drink it.  

The upgraded room really made this a terrific redemption as ocean front club rooms were $1,458 including tax and fees (per night) for the same time!

Hyatt Regency Maui (20,000 Hyatt x 3 nights)
 As a “guest of honor” we were upgraded to a beachfront room on the 19th floor.  The view was great.  The Regency Club isn’t stocked quite as well as the Grand Club in Kauai, but it was more than ample for breakfast and the occasional beer at happy hour.  Valet fees were waived which was nice because you have to valet at this property.

CARS
Used AutoSlash to book rentals on both islands.  Reserved a convertible for roughly $200 on each island (even thought Kauai was for 1 more night).

* AwardHacker exists.

Have a 1-2 days of flexibility on departure and return if needed but would like to stick to those dates if possible.

**Balances:**
Singapore Krisflyer 110,000 (Expires Jan 24, 2019)

Aeroplan 142,107

AA 87,565

BA Avios 53,701

Delta 105,346

United 6,145

(Have UR and SPG to supplement if needed but want to use my airline miles I have now)

**Departure Plan Apr 5 NYC-BKK:**

**Avail:** AA award for CX JFK-HKG-BKK Y

**Desired:** Upgrade to JAL(Preferred) or CX hoping for close-in avail to open up for 70k AA.

**Return Apr 16 BKK-NYC:**

**Avail:** Thai-Asiana BKK-ICN-JFK on Krisflyer 97.5k.

**Desired:**

*Option 1:* Again hope for close-in avails to open up on EVA BKK-TPE-JFK or ANA BKK-NRT/HND-JFK

*Option 2:* Thai / Lufthansa BKK-FRA-JFK for 112.5k in F (close-in avail)

* Debating option 2 as Thai/LH F experiences are really well-reviewed. But the extra 12.5k points is enough for a shorthaul NA worth about $100-200 and have to pay $300-400 in surcharges I think for LH... Is it worth it? I know it's subjective... CX/JAL I've flown in F and while it was cool, wouldn't normally spend more points to go F over J on those airlines.

**Thoughts/Questions**

* I'm trying to reduce the random buckets of points I have. I'm trying to use AA (as there's no other way for me to use those) and Krisflyer as it has the hard expiry. But would welcome suggestions if I really should be using something else.

* I'm really familiar with last-min avails on AA with CX/JAL and feel pretty good about finding something within 2 weeks. But I'm not familiar at all with last-min on the * Alliance - EVA/ANA/LH/Thai. Is it the same as CX/JAL? Am I likely to be able to find F avail on LH/Thai or barring that ANA/EVA on J getting closer to departure? How soon should I be looking? Ideally I'm not trying to search avails during the trip.

* If I did choose to go F, I'd normally book the ""better"" cabin experience at the departure, not the return but I'm reading a big part of the appeal of Thai F is the lounge/departure services so I've put that on the return end.

* Noting also that Songkran is Apr 13-15 so I don't know if returning Apr 16 is going to be tougher to find avails.

* I've travelled on CX/JAL but not the other airlines mentioned but appreciate any tips, thoughts on the itinerary, airlines I'm picking, or anything else would be appreciated!"

We have decided that we want to spend the bulk of our trip in Africa and I'm trying to figure out the best way to do so whilst also stopping over in Brazil on the outbound and somewhere in Europe on the inbound.



We are looking to fly either business or first out of Toronto, NYC, or BOS. I found some potential itineraries on ANA, but can't seem to get the last few legs to work. I know ANA has some restrictions, but thought I could make it work with one stopover in each direction (I think I'm exceeding the number of legs??). I was able to get YYZ-GRU-JNB, SEZ-YYZ to work on ANA for 208k + $1200, but we don't want to stay in Seychelles for that long (7/14/18) and we don't want to head back on 7/11/18.



I have points in various programs

UR - 415k

SPG - 160k

MR - 175k

AA - 350k

Delta - 250k

TYP - 100k

AS - 65k

BA - 100k

My rough itinerary is below

6/27/18 -- YYZ-GRU (award ANA)

6/30/18 -- GRU-JNB (award ANA)

7/1/18 -- JNB-HDS (cash)

7/4/18 -- HDS-JNB (cash)

7/6/18 -- JNB-SEZ (cash)

7/11/18 -- SEZ-Europe (award)

7/14/18 -- Europe-YYZ (award)



Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I'm willing to pay cash for some positioning legs to keep the bulk of the trip on an award ticket. I'd like to keep the fuel surcharges down if possible and can also book an additional award ticket to position."

Anyone lucky enough to also grab one of these?

Earlier I wrote about choosing between United and Delta, but now this is making me heavily consider AA. Although I’m considering just crediting the flight to Alaska instead and sticking with Delta. "

We're relatively flexible on dates (fly out either Friday or Saturday, 8/9 - 16 or 15/16 - 23). I've got roughly 160k UR between my wife and I and approx 25k Delta skymiles as well. Not much else of everything else. 

I checked award hacker and it told me Korean air was cheapest, but there weren't any options when I checked their site. It wouldn't even let me search a domestic North America flight. Delta and other places are showing approx 80k for 2 people round trip. Is there anyway to do that cheaper?"

239,First award redemption - throw me your opinion!,4,5s1o32,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5s1o32/first_award_redemption_throw_me_your_opinion/,18,2017-02-04 20:01:27,"So I'm taking my girlfriend and myself to Rome this September and I had 125,000 Delta points.  I noticed the cheapest tickets after some searching on the Delta website was 70k each way.  I transferred 20k SPG points for the 25k bonus which took 24 hours.   So since I only have half the ideas planned, I did a one way JFK-FCO 2 business tickets 140k total with a 2 hour stopover in CDG (only $50 total in taxes.)  

This is on the Air France partner and I heard better things with their business product vs Delta One.  It also worked for me because we got 2 seats together (if reverse herringbone even allows us to see eachother)  and I was able to use my 320,000 Hilton points to get 5 nights stay at the Waldorf Cavalieri with the king room.

So fiddling with different dates I noticed some 5 night stretches at the hotel only let me select the twin double, which would of been terrible obviously.  I know how if something works, jump on it don't wait.. so I'm just curious if this was all in all a ""great"" redemption or just an ""ok"" redemption.  

I also noticed after I booked there was a fantastic redemption on AMEX points with Alitalia but I had 0 of those points so oh well!  Just figured I'd ask the pros so I can be mindful for the future.

Whatever the case, I have to now figure out what else to do in Europe since we plan to make this a 2 week trip :)"

I’m looking to go to Europe with my SO in late June 2019 for a two week trip. We live in the west coast and can fly out of sfo/lax/sea. We want to stop by Athens and Santorini for five or so nights, pretty open for other cities for the rest of the trip. Ive been looking for J availability to/from Greece and France and cant seem to find any on both United and Delta. Wondering what cities are more likely to have availability at that time as entry/departure points to Europe? 

I was really hoping to find TK but there’s absolutely no availability. Is this expected? I used to see tons of availability. 

Have 300k+ in both UR and MR. 

Thanks for the help! "

The place is awesome.

I also recently got the SW Companion Pass (We're in SAN). We have an upcoming scheduled trip to SFO in a month and I'm not sure if it's worth spending some points to stay there.

A loose plan on what we've got planned in the near future is: SEA, PDX & SJD for quick weekend getaways in 2019-early 2020. And a big trip to Japan in 2020 after the Olympics.

Here's a breakdown of our points right now:


Type | Points
----|------
MR | 87k
UR | 68k
AA | 74k
Delta | 19k
Southwest | 117k
Hilton | 153k



The lowest cash fare I'm seeing for 2 nights in SFO is $500. I'm not sure if it's worth blowing up my hilton points there, or potentially save them for an upcoming SW CC trip. I'm thinking that MR and UR will be valuable for Japan. What do you guys think?"

Looking to book a return upper class flight from Provance/Tuscany to Boston in June 2020.   I have a 3 day window to fly back, so its semi-flexible.

Available: 105k AAvantage miles, 100k Chase, 60k TYP, 115k Delta

Options (all around between 200-400 in fees) 

1) Delta One via Virgin Atlantic 47.5k (VA Miles).  Concern is i can only book London - Boston, so would have to have a 2nd reservation/itereray to get to London.    Booking via Delta (which would allow to reserve the intra-europe leg) is 80k

2) British Airways Business 57.5k (Avois OR AA miles) 

3)BA First (80k/per) (AA Miles & Avois)

&#x200B;

Essentially - is BA First worth 2x Delta One?  And - any issues with having two reservations to get back (one to london and the other delta one london-boston)?

&#x200B;

Anyone have any thoughts or other suggested airlines?"
