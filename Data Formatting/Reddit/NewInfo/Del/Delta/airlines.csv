According to [https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html](https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html)

""Passengers will be able to hold a reservation without payment, or cancel a booking without penalty, for 24 hours after the reservation is made, if they make the reservation one week or more prior to a flight’s departure date.""

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

So I disputed the $200 fee with my bank, and just now I've realized that I lost the dispute.

As for the 3rd party, if it was a 3rd party who booked this, it was an @travelersdesks.com email address who sent me confirmation. Does anyone know what company this is? I was in contact with them through Delta's direct customer service line +18002211212 from an agent claiming to be a supervisor."

3,My cellphone has been stuck in the guts of a Delta Airlines jet for a month,0,32ldps,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/32ldps/my_cellphone_has_been_stuck_in_the_guts_of_a/,19,2015-04-14 22:46:56,"So a month ago my cellphone fell out of my pocket on takeoff and down into the inner workings of Delta Airlines Jet.  They said they would mail it back to me when they were able to dig it out but it's been a month and other than the ""we received your complaint"" auto-response email I have heard nothing from Delta.  I am open to suggestions on how to resolve this properly.

This is the message I sent to Delta Airlines:  

To Whom It May Concern At Delta,

During takeoff on DELTA 2379 on the morning of 3/16/2015 my cellphone slid out of my coat pocket and fell through a gap in the floor that should have never been there in the first place. 

There are these plastic panels that are supposed to be attached where the floor of the cabin and the curve of the plane fuselage meet.  I noticed that in my window seat ( 39F or 41F, I can't recall exactly, only that it was a window seat) that the panel to the right of the window seat directly in front of me was completely detached and being propped up by the bracket the seat is mounted to.  You could easily see a couple feet down into the plane through the hole.  The panel next to my seat was still basically attached but was shoved in at the bottom leaving about a two inch gap.  A gap, as it turns out, that is big enough for cellphone to fall through.

I had initially assumed my phone was just on the floor somewhere after I dropped it and that I would probably have to  wait until we landed at Minneapolis-Saint Paul to look for it, given the confines of the seating arrangement.  It was only when I was unable to find my phone anywhere where it would be reasonable expected to be found given the layout that I noticed the missing and shoved-in panels.  I theorized that it had probably fallen through one of the shoved-in/defective panel gap(s) and I voiced my concerns as such.  The flight crew were all standing around discussing what could be done, even the captain had come back to see what all the fuss was about.  I was told they were going to get an engineer to look for it while the plane was being prepared for it's next and within the hour take off.  

After about 20 minutes I asked a Delta associate behind the desk if she knew anything about the lost phone, and was told, after she went back down the ramp to ask, that they had indeed found my phone and that it had indeed fallen through the gap in the shoved-in panel and into the ""guts"" of the plane.  After not being able to reach it with the tools they had I was informed that they, understandably, aren't going to hold up a plane to fish out someone's cellphone, and that they would mail my phone back to me when they have more time to get it out.  They took down my address and info and I left to catch my connecting flight to Washington-Reagan.

I've just spent the last week driving my afraid-to-fly daughter and her two cats from Washington, DC to Medford, OR.  a 3,000+ mile trip where a cellphone full of important family contact info and working GPS is all but essential.  I went ahead and purchased a cheap cellphone and a prepaid SIM card, there was really no choice in the matter.  The phone is unfortunately horribly inferior to the Samsung Galaxy 5s of mine that is (probably), still ""flying the friendly skies"" for free wedged deep down inside the plane.  

I still have not received said phone back nor heard a word from Delta about it and can only surmise that they didn't bother or were unable to actually retrieve the aforementioned glass and metal electronic device from inside the body of the plane.

So it comes down to this: were it not for the sorry and disturbingly-poor state of the floor panels my phone would have never gotten lost in the innards of this plane.  Had the cabin been properly maintained this would have never been the huge problem it has turned into.  It is not unreasonable to expect a plane to be maintained at least to the level were it is somewhat difficult for electronic devices to fall into it's inner workings.  If my phone is not returned within the next couple weeks I expect Delta to either replace it with the exact same model or compensate me for its worth.  This is generously-reasonable request given the circumstances.

I eagerly await your reply.

That is a huge difference, and I want to book it with Expedia but I don’t know if I should. And the layover at ATL is 1 hour as well. Should I stick with Expedia? Thanks for all the help! "
5,Fiance an I removed from Delta Flight due to glitch,1,4xyjyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/4xyjyw/fiance_an_i_removed_from_delta_flight_due_to/,16,2016-08-16 12:55:29,"So I've got a few questions here, I've already contacted the Department of Transportation in the USA, however I need to know about baggage. First you need backstory.

Basically my Fiance an I were 2 hours early to our flight, we were checked in and everything was good, itinerary, boarding pass, tickets etc all for the 9th of August. When it came time to board our tickets flashed red with an error about ""lack of flight crew"" or something, but the gate agent saw we had the right boarding passes and let us on.

Once on the plane a lady ended up getting the same seat number as me (she was someone who was changed over to this flight to Seattle because she had missed hers the day before). After about 10 minutes, the gate crew turned up and told my fiance an I that we had to leave the plane. We showed them our boarding pass, and tickets etc, and they just said ""you need to get off"".

We had no idea at this point what the hell was going on. When we got back to the gate they told us ""You booked your tickets for tomorrow, not today"". Red flags instantly went up, we were like ""hold on no we didn't?"" they wouldn't help us there, they told us we had to go back to the booking counter and sort it out there, so we did. Once there they told us the same thing ""you booked for tomorrow"". The lady who actually sent us through 2 hours earlier appeared and questioned why we were there, we told her and she said ""It said the 9th, their itinerary and everything is for the 9th"" that's when they went ""oops, it's just a glitch...you were meant to be on that flight"". I should point out that the flight had more than 10 seats left, so it was in no way full.

After 3 hours of piss arsing on their end, and explaining that I HAD to get back to Australia for an important VISA interview, they finally got us onto some flights. This is where it got even more stupid. They were unable to check our baggage in, and tried to tell us that we couldn't get on the flight because their system wouldn't let us check our baggage...until finally one of the guys was like ""We do have manual tickets you know"". So they got us manual tickets through the gate, and our luggage was put on there. Please note we had to fly to Seattle using Atlantic, because Delta had already left with no other flights for the day to Seattle.

Our next stop over from Seattle was to LAX, we arrived with 30 minutes to spare before we had to get on, and were assured our luggage was safely going to LAX.

So once we arrived in LAX, we had at least a bit of leeway with time, a good 1 hour and a half! To get to our gate. So we made it there, and turns out they gave our seats away! SHOCK! Well Delta did, at this point we were going to be flying through with Virgin, but it seems Delta didn't reiterate them our seats....eventually they sorted that out and we managed to get on the plane. We waited 2 hours....the plane wasn't leaving. Why? Apparently 22 passengers were missing from the plane, so they had to take their luggage off. Which was weird, because it sure as hell didn't look like 22 passengers were missing from the bloody plane.

Anyway after 14 hours we arrived back in Brisbane, and...no luggage. Nothing. In fact, it wasn't just my fiance an I, it was about 22 of us or so that lost our luggage. Turns out Delta's system didn't really relay to them correctly on luggage.

Anyway it took them 4 days to get our luggage back to us, now we've run into the issues in trying to get compensation.

Virgin Australia doesn't seem to have the option to make a claim for delayed luggage, in fact the details on my page are not up to date properly and seem to be reading wrong, not to mention they managed to screw up my email. On top of that we can't make a claim through Delta because we don't have a number for Delta's site that works.

So what I want to know is...what can we do? We had to spend about $200AUD just to get clothes and toiletries for the 4 days we had NOTHING. Do I call them? Or am I fresh out of luck?



Also they offered us absolutely NO compensation when they involuntarily removed us from the flight in the first place, nothing at all. They told us that we needed to come the next day....to flights that didn't even exist on their website or on their own database!"
6,What Airline out of these would you recommend most?,3,3ait97,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/3ait97/what_airline_out_of_these_would_you_recommend_most/,15,2015-06-20 20:35:22,"I'm not sure if this was the correct subreddit to post this on, but anyway, I'm planning on taking a trip to Miami, Florida the end of next week. The only reasonable flights are flying Frontier to and between Frontier, US Airways, and American Airlines flying back. I've only ever flown JetBlue before, and have only ever had good experiences with them.

My question is, basically, how are your experiences onboard with those airlines? Like, with JetBlue, you get free snack and beverages, and are also able to watch tv. Although, those things are not important to me, but they definitely make the trip more comfortable.

My friend(who is a huge enthusiast of anything aircraft and also works at an airport) recommended Delta over American. So basically, which airline/s out of the ones I've mentioned would you most recommend? I know it probably doesn't matter, but I figured I ask for everyone's opinion on which they prefer."

I took a flight from Calgary and when u arrived to go through immigration they told me my flight was canceled. I later went to a JetWest representative who said it was due to traffic control and something about weather at LGA (Sounds like BS) as I checked weather for New York and it is perfectly fine. I was told to contact JetWest for reimbursement and was told that I would not get ANY compensation because it was not there fault. This is ridiculous. On my way to Calagary, my flight to Toronto was delayed heavily and I missed my flight to Calgary. There, I had to wait 9 hours for the next flight and given no compensation. I can somewhat understand the departure flight issue and why I wasn't given anything but I do not understand why I cannot receive imbursement for my arriving flight to New York even if I don't take the flight as I am trying to take a rental car to New York. The tight grip that airlines have on passengers is aburd and something should really be done about this. 

EDIT:
I was told I can take a flight tomorrow from Toronto to Atlanta and then later that day from Atlanta to LaGuardia using Delta Airlines. That is the only option WestJet has given me. It is not a suitable option because I cannot miss another day of work. I also have to book a hotel now. "
9,An Open Letter to the CEO of Frontier Airlines,7,5jv6v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/5jv6v9/an_open_letter_to_the_ceo_of_frontier_airlines/,12,2016-12-23 07:26:50,"An open letter to Mr. Barry L. Biffle, CEO of Frontier Airlines.

Dear Mr. Biffle,
I thought you might be interested in knowing how well Frontier did this holiday season.

My family’s plan was straightforward.  I’m in the military, currently stationed in Australia, having served in Korea the year before.  I haven’t seen my family in 12 months, with the exception of two one-week windows during the summer.  Once when I was helping put my mother in hospice care, and again at her funeral.  This holiday season was the perfect time for a family vacation to Disney World.  My four year old is at the magic age where a hug from Tigger IS a hug from Tigger, and not a guy in a suit.  My daughter is a senior in High School, and this Christmas was going to be the golden time for one last family vacation before she pushed out into her adult life.  We even convinced my father to meet us down in Orlando, so he wouldn’t spend his first Christmas season alone.  When my daughter graduates, my family will join me in Australia, and trips to Disney, or even to visit my father, would be cost prohibitive.  This holiday season was supposed to be the time for me to have that family vacation where I could reconnect with my family.  We had a condo lined up for the week before Christmas at a beautiful resort (seven swimming pools!).  I flew in from Australia on the 15th, and would leave from Colorado Springs with my 17 year old and four year old on 17 December.  My wife and 13 year old son would join us on the 18th, since he was competing in the State of Colorado First Lego League Championships.  My father would fly down from Michigan on the 18th as well, staying at the same resort.  Maybe not the simplest, but a straightforward plan nonetheless.  Frontier Airlines seemed the perfect airlines to transport a family of five.  I wasn’t looking for frills, and I had never had a problem with them before.

There had been some weather overnight, and on the morning of the 17th, my wife checked your website to find the flight had been cancelled.  It seemed odd that it was cancelled so early, especially given other flights from other airlines didn’t seem to be cancelled.  But, the weather was bad, and I acknowledge weather can indeed have cascading effects on airlines.  Throughout that day, I spent a total of nine hours on hold.  You might be unaware of it, but the way your phone system is designed, it automatically disconnects when someone is on hold for four hours.  You might want to consider investing in one of those “call-back” systems, instead of subjecting people to four hours of Frontier propaganda on how great the airline is.  By the time I reached a customer service rep, I managed to get me and two of my kids booked for the 19th.  I’d also like to point out that I never received an email, or any notification the flight was cancelled.  In fact, your voice system was still tracking it as on time.  If my wife hadn’t decided to check the website, I wouldn’t have known until I arrived at the airport.  I was losing two days from my vacation, but I could live with that.  The worst part was telling my four year old we weren’t going to Disney that day.

The plan was manageable.  I called the condo and rental car company and let them know my wife wouldn’t be checking in until the 18th.  She and my son would meet my dad in Orlando.  They would spend the day shopping for food, getting Disney tickets, and preparing for me and my other two kids to arrive on the 19th  Not an ideal plan (I was paying for a night at the condo that wasn’t being used), but totally manageable.  As we loaded their bags into our van so I could drive them to the airport, my wife received an email saying the flight was cancelled.  This was a total shock.  No other airline was cancelling flights, and I had been checking the website all day; there was no indication it was cancelled until two hours and twenty minutes before the flight.  It was allegedly cancelled because of weather.  Yet no other airline was having weather issues.  Your plane makes an Orlando-Phoenix-Colorado Springs loop.  Weather at all three airports was clear.  I spend another three hours on hold, and finally get a customer service representative.  She tells me I can get a refund or reschedule the flight for the evening of the 23rd.  Which would give my wife and son a grand total of ONE day at Disney World before our flight back the morning of the 25th.  

The plan was expensive.  I got a refund, and managed to get two tickets via Delta for the morning of the 20th.  The tickets were a little out of my price range, but it was worth being together as a family.  I called the condo and told them to hold the room until the next night (again paying for a night that I wasn’t able to use).  I lost the rental car reservation, and am unsure whether I will be refunded the money I spent on the voucher.  My father was now alone in Orlando with no family.  I had just blown my budget for the vacation buying last minute tickets.  But we would be together as a family, and I wouldn’t have to tell my four year old we weren’t going to see Mickey.  It wasn’t an ideal plan, it had gotten very expensive, but in the end, everyone would be together and happy right?  I spent all day on the 19th checking not only my flight status, but the flight from Phoenix to Colorado Springs.  Both were on time for most of the day, but before I left for the airport, the website showed a 40 minute delay.  We pack our van up, load up me and two kids, and head to the airport.  We arrive at the airport, and check in.  The lady behind the counter says the flight is delayed, but when I ask if the plane is even in Phoenix, she says yes.  Having looked at the weather map, I know the weather between Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Orlando is good.  It looks like everything is on track!  My four year old is higher than a kite, almost impossible to control as he gets more and more excited about leaving.  He points out every plane through the window as we walk to our gate, absolutely sure that the plane he is pointing to is the plane that is going to take us to Mickey. As we get to the gate, a board notifies us that the flight will be delayed two hours.  I don’t understand why, since the plane is in Phoenix, and the weather is clear.  But ok.  Our bags are checked, every employee is saying we are going to be taking off.  I settle in, and work on occupying a hyperactive four year old.  Then all hell breaks loose.

The plan was a Cluster*#@!.  It started as a rumor, and quickly spread.  The flight had been cancelled.  No Frontier employees were around, but everyone pulls out their phone and checks the website, sure enough it reads cancelled.  People begin to call Frontier (interestingly enough, most people had that number handy).  No employees at the gate.  Zero.  Zilch.  People begin to line up.  As I go to get into line, my four year old begins to cry as he realizes he isn’t getting on the plane.  After about twenty minutes, three Frontier employees march up to the podium, and have the audacity to tell us the weather had caused the flight to be cancelled.  What?  For three days in a row, Frontier had cancelled a flight because of “weather.”  When it was pointed out that the weather wasn’t bad in any of the three locations, the employee stated that it was because the weather had prevented a rested crew from getting to Phoenix.  What?  The flight hadn’t flown for three days and you didn’t have a rested crew?  You couldn’t get a rested crew to the correct location?  This rings as untrue and disingenuous (heck, use a different airline and fly a crew to Phoenix).  It gets better.  Your employees state they weren’t even going to try to rebook.  You could either get a refund or call the toll-free number to try to rebook (but nothing was available until after Christmas).  And because the cancellation was caused by “weather,” no vouchers for hotels or flights would be given.  Apparently Frontier is effected differently by the weather than other (more reputable) airlines are.  So to sum up so far, I’ve paid for three nights on a condo that I haven’t used.  Lost a rental car reservation.  My recently widowed father is alone in Orlando.  I have two tickets to Orlando on Delta schedule to fly out on the 20th, but three members of my family with no tickets.

As I type this, my wife is trying to enjoy Disney World with my father, and our four year old (at $1300 for last minute ticket, I couldn’t afford for my whole family to fly).  From the pictures I’ve been sent, his smile is something to make the meanest villain smile and remember fond childhood memories.  For the last six months, I was looking forward to being with my family (and seeing that smile in person), and having one last family vacation.  Now I sit with my two teenagers binge watching TV (I should have never given the 17 year old the control of the remote), and missing out on the joys of my family being together.  Your airline absolutely ruined one of the (if not the) last family vacations I will have before my daughter leaves the house.  After 18 months away from my four year old, I missed an opportunity to bond with him, and a chance for him to be with his father on the happiest place on earth.  Your airlines brought stress, unanticipated expenses, and ultimately unhappiness to my family.  To be succinct, your airline sucks the joy out of life and turns the tolerable experience of flying into a living nightmare.

So why do I write to you.  Well for a few reasons.  One part of me wishes that investors see this, and realize what a sinking ship your company is.  This will in-turn prevent you from taking the company public, and as word of your crappy and unreliable service spreads, the private owners of the company will take a shellacking while the company goes belly-up.  Another part of me wishes that you realize how horribly your company is doing, and in a public relations stunt, you provide an all-expenses paid trip reuniting me and my family in Disney World.  Both unlikely, so instead, allow me to provide you some pointed feedback you need to make if you want your company to survive this fiasco.
•	Remember that travelers value reliability above comfort and price.  It’s great to only pay for what I want to use, but if you can’t guarantee that you’ll have me in the right place at the right time, then your airline is useless to me.  Yours was the only airline effected so drastically by the weather.  Most airlines had righted their ship within 6 hours of the storms.  Yours took longer than 72 hours, and still left people stranded.  You need to build up redundancy in your airline to anticipate weather/maintenance/mismanagement.  It might cost you more in operating expenses, but in the long run, you will keep customers coming back.  All the last 96 hours did was create thousands of people who will never fly Frontier again (and their families).  Ryanair, the epitome of no frills and cheap, is, at its core, reliable.

•	Have transparency when talking to your clients.  We are not idiots.  I know no other airline was affected by weather.  I know the weather at the three cities in question was flyable.  I know planes can travel over and around bad weather between cities.  Don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining.  If the other rumors that this was really caused by a sick-out/strike are true, then you need to tell people that.  If an employee said “hey, we can rebook you, but we think there is a sick-out going on, it’s up to you,” then I can make the choice if I want to risk it.  Instead you strung me along for three days, each day costing me more money.

•	Own your mistakes.  Weather may have provided the first wrinkle, but let’s be honest, your employees mismanaged planes and crews.  And you need to own that mistake.  And then you need to throw free stuff at people.  If you refunded my $1000 in tickets and gave me a $2000 voucher to use over the next two years, do you think I would be bitching right now?  No.  I would be telling people that Frontier had some major problems, but they went out of their way to try and make things right.  Instead I’m telling people I will never fly Frontier again, and they ruined my last chance at a family vacation after being apart from them for a year.  Oh, and since we both know it wasn’t weather, then there wouldn’t have been countless hours by your clients and employees rebooking flights that weren’t really going to take off.

•	Invest in some customer service infrastructure.  I spent over 12 hours on hold over a 48 hour period.  Hire another call center.  Or update your system to allow call-backs so I don’t have to wait with my ear to the phone.  If you do choose to ignore any of my advice, please at least change your on-hold message.  Plug in a radio station or comedy channel or something.  But for the love of god, recognize that four hours of your propaganda is cruel and unusual.


Mr. Biffle, your mistake was cutting so many costs that you couldn’t handle a simple (and expected) down turn in weather.  Whether it was lack of redundancy, mismanagement of resources, or alienated pilots, you’ve cut too many corners to try and stay cheap.  If you aren’t viewing the events of 17-19 December as an existential crisis of your airlines, then you are misreading the American public, and our tolerance for incompetence with high value items.  You are about to make Frontier the Schlitz Beer of the airline industry, destined to be a case study to MBA students on how to turn a viable company into a footnote.  I saw the lines at the counter and endured the hold time, there is a demand for your services, but people will never demand crappy service for hundreds of dollars, and that, sir, is what you are currently providing.

Sincerely,
B. Novak

The supervisor told her it was their fault and due to crew issues, but that they couldn't do anything because it was late in the day. The supervisor said that she may be able to get a hotel voucher at the airport of her connection, but arrangements could not be made ahead of time.
My mom didn't like the idea of flying and not having definitive plans for the night. I picked her up and will be driving her to the airport again tomorrow morning before work starts for me. My mother will also have to take another personal day. Given that this delay was due to crew issues and not weather or something beyond Delta's control can my mother get reimbursed in any way?"

Our flight was scheduled for early this morning, flying direct from Austin, TX to DTW.  We got emailed at 5 AM, just before we woke up to get to the airport. I called to ask about rescheduling, but the wait time on the phone was more than an hour, so we needed to go to the airport anyways.  We were told there was severe weather issues, but the only airline affected was spirit and the only flight affected was ours. All other airlines we're running and spirit was backed up all the way down the hall, we didn't move for over an hour. This same issue happened the day before, and the people in line behind us were ""rebooked"" for today's flight, which got cancelled again. We ended up going with another airline to just get home, and after the BS of trying to get a refund for 3 hours on the phone, will never fly with them again. Is there anything else we are able to do to avoid this in the future? Is spirit on the hook for anything more than just a refund since they gave us just over 2 hours of notice? We couldn't sit another 2 hours in line to get to the spirit desk, but in the hour we spent waiting, they moved just a couple of people to empty seats on a Delta flight, is there a reason they didn't move more people?  I know it costs them money but it seems like the cost of moving passengers vs losing passengers would be less.  Thank you for any info, veteran travellers!"

I went to the service desk and they got me on another flight with Delta but I had to connect at another airport (my original flight was a direct flight). My first flight in the connection was behind schedule and by the time we landed I had 10 minutes to get to my connection flight , which was at a gate on the other side of the airport (my connection flight was in ATL, and that airport is freaking huge!)

I went to the desk again, was told there are no more planes with seats available going to my destination, so I was given a flight to an airport 1 hour away from my destination and I am now in a very expensive Uber to my original airport because my car is sitting in the parking lot.

Just checked my CC statement and there is a charge from Delta for $150 on the day I flew with them. Isn't it United's responsibility to cover that cost because they were under obligation from the Contract of Carriage to get me to the booked destination?"

59,UPDATE - Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me and Delta Delayed My Bag,0,435b3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/435b3a/update_virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_and/,3,2016-01-28 23:58:40,"**UPDATE**

I have an update regarding my situation as [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/)

After advice from the comments, I haven't contacted Virgin Atlantic yet knowing that I have a weaker case against them.

However, Delta's claim officer called me couple days ago and said that since my flight plan was cancelled by Virgin Atlantic, it's not Delta's fault that they delayed my bags for over a week, so they won't reimburse me anything.

Here's the story about the lost baggage. Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. The whole experience has been super expensive and frustrating for me.

**December 14th, 7 AM** - I flew from PHL to JFK in Delta. 

**8 AM** - I landed in JFK. I was at the Virgin Atlantic's boarding gate for about 45 minutes trying to figure out my travel situation. The VA agents at the boarding gate told me that my bag has been pulled out of the plane and I can collect it from Delta's baggage claim.

**8:45 AM** - When I went downstairs to the baggage claim, I couldn't find my bag. I spoke to Delta agents and they said that *""yes, your bag was pulled out of the plane, but one of our staff made a mistake and put it back on the queue. But your bag is still in the JFK airport. We will have baggage handling guys pull it out from the queue and bring it back here. You can come back after 30-40 minutes to pick it up.""*

**9:00 - 9:30 AM** - I used those 30 minutes to step out to the lounge area and figure out the rest of the trip. I finally booked my tickets with United and made travel arrangements to go to EWR from JFK (neither VA nor Delta helped me here, off course).

**9:30 - 4 PM** - When I came back after 30 minutes, I found my bag was still missing. I checked again - and they said, they are having someone bring my bag to me and asked me to just wait. Now, this is almost 10 AM. I spent next 6+ hours at the airport in the baggage claim area trying to figure out where my bag was. Delta kept changing their story from *""Wait for few minutes""* to *""It's Virgin Atlantic's fault, talk to them""* (spoke to Virgin Atlantic staff but she didn't even bother to look into their system to find my bag), to finally Delta acknowledging, *""Sorry, we can't find your bag, but we know it's in JFK""*. Delta's baggage claim supervisor tried to find my bag in the system. He said the last time my bag was in Delta's system was at 10:30 AM in one of the racks but when he called a staff in the racks area to retrieve my bag, it was not there. And they don't know where my bag is.

**4 PM** - My flight to United was at 8 PM, but I still needed to take a bus to EWR, do security check up again and figure out if they were also going to refuse to board me. Delta's baggage supervisor said *""sorry we messed up""* many times. They acknowledged that it was their own staff who mistakenly put my bag in the queue AFTER it was pulled out from the VA plane. The supervisor asked me to fill out the claim information. I wrote down my Indian (Delhi) address and Indian phone number, and the supervisor said ""we will deliver your bag to your doorstep in Delhi in a couple days"". I got a tracking number and the supervisor told me to track my bag on www.delta.com/trackbag

**4:30 PM** - I leave for EWR. No issues while boarding there.

**December 15th 10 PM (Indian Time)** - I land in Delhi.  I check delta.com/trackbag. I see that the bag is on a KLM flight (Delta's partner) and is in Amsterdam. And it is scheduled to arrive in Delhi on December 16th. 

**December 16th** - I check delta.com/trackbag - no update in status. I spend entire day at my address to make sure I don't miss the delivery. I called Delta, gave them my tracking ID and my baggage tag number - they couldn't find any information about my bag. Asked me to call back next day when they have more information. Delta's 999 Baggage Assistance emailed me saying the same - they have no information but they are trying to find it. I have that email as a record.

**December 17th** - I check the website - still no updates. I called Delta again, they acknowledge that the bag was enroute to DEL through Amsterdam, but they have no current information. Asked me to give them one more day. Email asked for more details, but didn't provide any idea about what happened to my bag. 

**December 18th (Friday)** - I check the website - still no updates. I call Delta - they had no new information for me. They don't know where my bag is. At 4 PM (1 hour before the airline luggage counters close), I simply drove to the DEL airport. Walked up to the KLM luggage counter at the airport. Found my bag sitting there among a pile of other lost and found bags. The staff there asked me to sign my name before allowing me to take the bag home with me. 

**December 19th (Saturday India Time/Friday EST)** - Received an email from Delta - they still have no clue where my bag is. I told them that I found my bag.

**Fast Forward - last week** - Delta sent an email saying that they were sorry for the delay in my bag and that I would be eligible for any purchases I made during this time. Asked me to send them receipts, which I did.

**Couple days ago** - The Delta claim agent called, asked me to tell her why I got out at JFK. I just mentioned *""I didn't have the right documents for Virgin Atlantic, so needed a different flight""*. And before I could even further explain the rest of the story, she just cut me off and said *""sorry, that's not a Delta problem. We are not liable for delay in your bag if you change plans. You are not eligible for any claim. Bye.""*

So there's where I am right now. I paid a huge price for my one mistake of not checking the transit visa requirements. But tell me, what's the Delta's price for being just incompetent? "

61,Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it...,2,7ac8ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/7ac8ox/could_us_legacy_carriers_bring_back_domestic_3/,3,2017-11-02 19:26:46,"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?"

I was coming back to Dallas, TX from Spain and had several stops. I had spent a month in London (and booked my long-haul flights in and out of there) and then later booked the leg to Spain. On the day I was coming home BA wouldn’t let anyone check-in using their phone and instead had to check-in at the desk. When I went to check-in at Barcelona there was an insane line with 2 agents working it. The agents were doing the typical Spain’s thing and taking their sweet time, taking a break every 20 minutes, etc. Got up to the desk to check-in finally and they were like “oh yeah your flight closed, sorry”. Then had to go arrange to get on the later flight to London and BA made me pay $300 to do this. This made me miss my other flights which cost $795 to move to the next available flight. BA has not responded to me at all. I’m extremely pissed because it’s their fault their app wasn’t letting people check-in which would’ve let me skip being in a massive check-in line. And of course BA is making me and everyone else who dealt with this scenario suffer. 

Anyone have any tips on how to bitch to the right person? Calling is useless, formal complaint seems to be useless, and tweeting at them Trump-style isn’t working either. 

Word to the wise, don’t fly BA! Only flying Delta/Virgin from now on."

According to TSA policy, I am fine (80Wh batteries), however, they state that individual airlines can have their own policies.  TSA policy is:

>Drones, Airwheels, airboards, solowheels, hoverboards, balance boards, balance wheels, and mini-Segways are considered portable electronic devices with lithium ion batteries.

>The allowance for passengers to have portable electronic devices in their checked or carry-on baggage is determined by the size (Watt-hour rating) of the lithium ion battery as follows:

>1) Where the lithium ion battery does not exceed 100 Wh passengers may have these devices in either checked or carry-on baggage.

>2) Where the lithium ion battery exceeds 100 Wh but does not exceed 160 Wh passengers may have these devices in either checked or carry-on baggage, but approval of the airline is required.

>3) Where the lithium ion battery exceeds 160 Wh the device is forbidden from being in either passenger checked or carry-on baggage.

>Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.

I can't find any details on Delta, aside from referring back to TSA. Obviously my concern is someone arbitrarily saying No... which I guess could happen at any time.

Does anyone have experience/knowledge with Delta specifically?"

They randomly put me in a seat in the middle of the row of 4, but I'd prefer an aisle.  I went to Delta.com 2 days ago and clicked the seat selection button. The only seats I could change to were the one directly behind me or any open seats in economy comfort which they wanted to charge almost $1000 HKD each leg.  So I called Delta and they said there were plenty of seats but airline was holding them. I checked today for seat selection and ere are 23 aisle seats available.  Now they want to charge $380 to reserve one of those, even the one right next to me. I truly love how 2 days ago the only way to change my seat was to get Economy comfort for almost $1000 HKD when there were obviously all these other seats available, at a lower price if you were willing to pay. What a scam!!!  The best part is this is even how they treat their Rewards Club Members. I may not fly often but I feel when I called and directly spoke to somebody this problem should have been resolved. Just another airline  nickel and diming everyone. "

74,Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me After Flying Me From PHL to JFK and Refused to Refund My Money - What to do?,1,42hdq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/,2,2016-01-24 22:49:28,"Dear Redditors, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this question. 

I am just looking what's the best thing for me to do and some advice on how to proceed on this nightmare that I faced last month. Also, is there any hope to get any percentage of money refunded - either for departure or return tickets.

**Here's the story (sorry it’s long):**
Couple months ago, I bought a round trip ticket for last month from PHL to DEL (New Delhi, India) on Virgin Atlantic last month. The connecting flights were from PHL to JFK (with Delta - partnering with Virgin Atlantic), JFK to LHR (with Virgin Atlantic), and LHR to DEL (Virgin Atlantic). 

This was my first time flying with Virgin Atlantic. And here was my US Visa situation - I had an expired H1-B visa and I was flying to India to get the Visa renewed. Actually, the visa was already renewed by my employer, so I just need a new Visa stamp in an US consulate, which can only be done outside the US. I confirmed with a Virgin Atlantic customer service agent before flying that my Visa situation would not be an issue on the date of flying.

On the date of the flight, the Delta staff at PHL boarded me to JFK. Once I landed in JFK, the Virgin Atlantic staff at the JFK boarding gate refused to board me. They mentioned that I did not have an UK issued transit visa required for me to go through LHR. What bothered me most is that the staff there looked at all of my documents - my passport, current and expired visa documents - and falsely (I will explain why falsely later) claimed that I do not even have the right Visa documents for United States. They said “You do not have an US Visa or proper documents, you cannot leave this country and fly anywhere”. In reality, I actually did have all the paper work that I needed to leave the country, go to India, get my visa stamped at an US consulate, and then return back. 

I have been in United States for last 14 years, and this was the worst example of customer service I had ever experienced in my life. The staff were extremely rude, condescending, simply refused to help me, or find me another Virgin Atlantic flight that goes through other routes to DEL. 

When I called Virgin Atlantic customer service for further help, the staff on the phone couldn’t also help me with other routes. They had already flew me from PHL to JFK, so now I am stuck in the middle of my journey in an airport far from my home (Philly) without any help from Virgin Atlantic. If this were still in Philly, I could have just driven home and planned  something better. 

I called the customer service again - this time to cancel the remainder of my journey and they said that I needed to pay $200 more to cancel the remaining trip. I asked if I get a travel voucher instead - and they said that would also cost my additional money ($200+ more). When I asked if I can get a refund, they said the tickets are non-refundable and I needed to talk to my travel agent. I put Virgin Atlantic staff and my travel agent representative on a conference call. Essentially, the travel agent mentioned that the money is already processed by Virgin Atlantic, so VA needs to refund it. And Virgin Atlantic staff refused to proceed with any refund.

Finally, I had to purchase another direct flight on a different airlines (United) from a different airport (EWR) which cost me an arm and a leg. The tickets I bought for Virgin Atlantic were simply a waste since I could neither use them nor get any money for refund. 

In addition to all that, Delta lost my checked in luggage when I flew from PHL to JFK and they couldn’t find my bag in JFK airport. It took them more than 10 days to find my bag (well, more like after repeatedly calling them and trying to identify the location of my bag and unable to get any response from them, I simply drove to the airport in DEL, and found my bag lying near their airport counter, unattended).

Given the terrible experience with Virgin Atlantic, I did not take the return flight with them - so those return tickets were also wasted.

The United flight was a direct flight from EWR to DEL - the staff there did not have any issues with my documentations. And in the US Embassy in New Delhi, I got my Visa stamped instantly - the embassy staff there mentioned that I have been in US for long enough and I had all the right documentations for me to get it instantly approved - contradicting Virgin Atlantic boarding gate staff’s theory that I did not have the right US Visa documentations and hence their ground for refusal to board me. 

**tl;dr** - Virgin Atlantic (in partnership with Delta) flew me from PHL to JFK, before refusing to board me at JFK. Then they refused to refund my money and Delta misplaced my baggage for more than a week.

1) Flying from MCI to Atlanta and then flying from there to JFK. Both flights are operated by Delta and the baggage would be transferred. Pros: Cheaper price. Cons: about 9–10 hrs layover (from 12 AM till 9 AM) till my international flight.

2) Flying from MCI to Denver and then flying from Denver to JFK. MCI-DEN flight operated by Frontier, DEN-JFK — by Delta. 
Pros: I’d arrive around 5 AM having not a long layover till my international flight. Cons: costs 60$ more, the baggage wont be transferred, also not sure how reliable Frontiers are .

I have never had to stay at the airport for 9 hours at night, so I cant make up my mind. 

Which option would you choose?"
81,Delta free upgrade?,1,dkjwrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/dkjwrz/delta_free_upgrade/,2,2019-10-20 17:55:20,"2 years ago, I was on a Virgin Atlantic flight from London Heathrow to New York. When I landed in JFK I had a connection on Delta and I was in seat 11A comfort plus. I was booked economy for both flights but on Delta it seems I got upgraded. My connection on delta was an early morning flight and I had a overnight layover. Could that be a reason why and could this happen again?"

83,"Delta airlines, might miss flight",2,6pg2bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/6pg2bm/delta_airlines_might_miss_flight/,2,2017-07-25 17:20:38,"Hello,

I have an upcoming flight on Delta. My girlfriend's work screwed her over and is trying to make her work the day we fly out.(even though they approve her vacation before we bought tickets.)

She is trying to get someone to cover her shift so we can make it on time.  But she might have to miss the flight. And there won't be another flight out until the next day probably. 
We have insurance on the tickets.

Would it be better to call ahead and try to move her flight to the next day? Or show up a few hours late and try to get the ticket changed?

I will probably have to fly out on the scheduled day so I can arrange the car, rooms, and everything.

Also, will I be able to check her bags and get them there ahead of her?

84,Thomas Cook airlines [xpost r/travel],5,b187aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/b187aq/thomas_cook_airlines_xpost_rtravel/,2,2019-03-15 04:35:33,"I recently purchased a transatlantic flight through Thomas Cook Airlines. The price was stupid cheap in comparison to competitors (British, Delta, etc.), so I went with it. Any thoughts on this airline? The reviews seem average all things considered. The one thing that concerns me is it's a ""charter"" airline. Does that make it susceptible to cancelling flights if there aren't enough tickets purchased? Aside from weather is this airline like some of the other budgets airlines that cancel and delay like crazy? I can't really afford to miss that flight as I am going to a wedding. "
85,Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying?,1,aczkcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/aczkcl/reasons_you_should_check_carryon_size_limits/,2,2019-01-06 02:20:11,"Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying:

1. Always check allowed sizes before a flight (they can change). Slightly oversized bags may make it on most flights, but eventually someone at a random gate will tell you it can't go onboard, that it will have to go as checked baggage, and possibly charge you for it (sometimes between transfers).

2. Certain items damaged in checked baggage are not covered under airline policies. You should ALWAYS declare said items if stopped at the gate and either repack to protect it or attempt to work out another arrangement. Never assume personnel saying ""Don't worry, we'll take good care of it"" is enough to place liability on the airline.

3. Despite nobody doing this, ever, READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE you are agreeing to before a flight. Usually when buying a ticket or at the time of check-in is when you agree to abide by said terms.

4. DOT only oversees guidelines for bag damage, not airline excluded items. Items not covered policies are acknowledged as an agreement between airlines and the passengers by terms of service / policies.

5. You may go through the hassle of having to physically file your claim at the airport within 24hrs or less of arrival, fill out a lengthy claim form with proof of purchase and photo evidence, possibly receive a cookie cutter response from corporate that your claim was denied (without providing a channel to explain the scenario that occurred), and realize you may have a low chance of winning a legal battle / wasted most of your time because your bag was just slightly more oversized than the allowed carry-on size you agreed to at the time of ticket purchase or check-in.

6. None of that may even matter because they allow for oversized carry-ons to begin with (or purposely choose to reduce overhead cabin size to increase checked bag sales) reducing available space, leading to (if you're unlucky enough) having your within limits carry-on bag go as checked baggage anyways. But hey, maybe you'll have more legal grounds to protect your items if you still follow reason 2 listed above.

7. Maybe you shouldn't fly anyways because the seats keep getting more cramped, less comfortable, you might get unlucky enough to be placed behind a higher class that can recline their seat into your face, and you could experience the consistent marketing taunt some airlines love to torture you with of how much better your experience could be if you paid them the big bucks (talking about you, Delta).

Side Note: Home insurance doesn't cover travel damage. Always keep receipts for all purchases. Read your product warranties, they usually do not cover physical damage or purchases by 3rd party vendors (which do exist on sites like Amazon).


My questions are:

1. Do you think enough social pressure would ever cause airlines to change their policies to benefit society as a whole versus pursuing lengthy and costly legal battles?

2. Are you going to read all of this or post a comment that says, ""do you seriously expect me to read all of this?"" before realizing I just called you out and delete your post but then possibly re-comment since I called you out again, but ultimately leave it up to chance because I'll end it with saying there's a probably you will either comment or not and suggest you should comment about people needing to read the fine print or terms of service. Or if you didn't realize I did all of this, we should all reply something stupid that seems like it should make sense related to the comment you posted.

3. Will this be reported at first glance for having my questions down at the bottom while riding the grey area of having an airline question along with a warning? If it does get take down, can I assume that this is a fact of life that life's a gamble and I probably will never receive an answer to stated question anyways?

4. Should we be more concerned as citizens that airlines are becoming too consolidated and are [extracted because idk if this language is allowed on this sub-reddit] us over with money grabbing policies, or accept it as a necessary evil to chance having unrestrictive opportunity (from a law perspective, unless lawmakers have money riding on that airline) to fuel the advancement of technology such as tablets on the back of seats? What solutions do you propose would lead to favorable outcomes for us citizens (or specific class level)?

5. Why Delta, why?

Which airline would you say has the best app?  I only have the big three US based ones (because I fly those more regularly—the airline varies with international travel) and I would say Delta, hands down.  I like how easy it is to see PQMs and PQDs for the trip right on the app, plus the ease of tracking checked bags.  I really find everything about the user interface appealing.

There are some nice things United and AA have on their apps that Delta doesn’t, but overall, they’ve got my vote."

Alaska will charge $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for the second, in line with new prices at JetBlue, American, Delta and United, according to a new fee chart on its website. JetBlue set $30 and $40 as the new industry benchmark when it hiked its fee in August.

Alaska passenger face a bigger increase in the charge for a second bag than passenger on other airlines because Alaska has been charging $25 for the second checked bag, compared with $35 before the increase as other carriers.

Alaska is also increasing the price for a third checked bag, to $100 from $75. That is still below the $150 fee charged by American, United and delta.

Overpacking will cost Alaska passengers more, too. The airline increased the fee for an overweight bag to $ 100 from $75. All bag fees are each way, per person.

Southwest Airlines are the only U.S. carrier offering free checked bags. Passengers are allowed to check two bags for free. Weight and size limits apply."
