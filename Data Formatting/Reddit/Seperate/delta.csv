0,Scary/awesome landing today,45,dljr4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dljr4y/scaryawesome_landing_today/,16,1571787973.0,"Wanted to throw some love to the delta team today. Flight DL 2872 from SAN to SLC was diverted to LAX because our landing gear got stuck in the down position after take off. Let me tell you, no imagination suffices to express the fear that ANY problem with landing gear yields while airborne. The crew and the pilots kept the cabin amazingly calm and after a nice little tour (40 laps) above San Diego, we landed in LA due to their longer runway. The pilots absolutely buttered the landing and all was without issue (bonus points for a full emergency crew greeting on the runway). Never been happier to fly with a specific carrier than I was after we rolled to a stop and the pilot came over the PA to appraise us of what happened. Fly delta jets 4 life!
Anyhow, never take a landing for granted. Fly safe everyone.","['https://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL2872/history/20191022/1325Z/KSAN/KLAX for those interested', ""Wow, glad everyone is safe. That's a scary experience. There's never a good time to have stuck landing gear...but if it MUST happen, I'd much rather have it stuck in the down position rather than stuck in the up position."", 'Better down than up!', 'Had that happen to me once on my one and only AA flight. Horrible feeling. Glad everything went okay!', 'Reminds me of the JetBlue flight with a similar issue a few years ago. However, JetBlue offered live tv in-flight so the passengers got to watch the news coverage of that nail bitting experience while it was happening. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/RgnkY4xzaZE', 'Someone forget the pins?', '>  rather than stuck in the up position.\n\nAs far as I know, unless there is a serious problem, pilots can just open the landing door manually and the landing gear will fall by gravity to its position.', 'For sure!', 'And SNLs shot at it: https://youtu.be/yVXkR4Z4GSg', 'No clue. Does that actually happen!?', ""Yes, but still. If it's stuck and can't drop for whatever reason, that would be really bad. I remember hearing about the Gimli Glider, a 767 that lost both engines. The main landing gear dropped and locked in place, but the nose gear wasn't heavy enough to completely drop down and lock into place."", 'The pins have big red ""REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT"" streamers. And the pilots are supposed to see them on their walkaround. And the pins are kept in the cockpit, and the pilots are supposed to verify that the pins are onboard', 'It does', '""Lost both engines"" is a fairly generous way to say that they had a [fueling unit conversion error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider#Running_out_of_fuel) and were refueled with about half of the fuel needed to make that flight', 'Can confirm this does happen and that this is the process. \n\nIt is quite rare, and thus has still been drilled into our pilots head repeatedly.', 'Yes indeed. A terrifying experience that resulted from such a simple error. An amazing story, though, with a happy ending.']"
1,Question about flying with an Autistic child,15,dgmczv,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dgmczv/question_about_flying_with_an_autistic_child/,21,1570861812.0,"So we're thinking of visiting Chicago in April and it would be my son's first flight. He'll be almost 6 at the time but he's Autistic. He loves car rides so as long as there's movement he's good. We'd also bring his tablet and lots of snacks. The flight is relatively short as well.

Here's my issue:
JetBlue is usually the preferred airline option for most families with Autism. In our situation I weighed the costs vs pros/cons. My husband and I are both big - he's over 6 feet but we're also heavier. If we did JetBlue we'd have to get very specific flights so the plane was 3x2 or 3x3 so we'd be together, and Economy seats are pretty tight. 

The other option is Delta.

Delta has a Canadair Regional Jet 900 that they use for NYC to Chicago flights. In First Class that's 1x2 seats. 

Taking cost into account I realized the difference between Economy JetBlue and First Class Delta was only $150 difference! Delta would mean significantly more room, less people to possibly disturb, and a flight attendant much closer if we needed anything. I'd also inform the airline ahead of time that he has Autism.

My question is this: has anyone taken a First Class flight with a child? I know I'm paying for a service but I don't want to get nasty looks from other passengers, as that's a real issue when we're out in public. He's pretty well behaved in that it's not like we let him run around screaming and hitting people, but he could potentially get scared during takeoff and landing and he could stim at times.

Is it generally frowned upon to seat a child in First Class? 

Has anyone flown with an Autistic child on Delta? If so, how was your experience, especially if you've also flown JetBlue.","['So let me say, I’m probably an expert here.  I have a son who’s 5 who’s autistic as well. I am also a diamond medallion with delta.  Due to my status when me and him fly we are always in first class.  I’ve only had one issue in all his flights, 50ish, but that was just when we had both boys and it was 10:30 at night and they were a little fussy boarding and I got a couple of looks.  They fell asleep shortly after.  \n\nI usually let the gate agent and flight crew know what’s going on when we see them and they are just over the top amazing.  \n\nMy son prefers noise canceling headphones, not sure how you do with noise.   \n\nMake sure you get a good photo in the Cockpit as I’m sure the pilot will welcome him in.  \n\nThe 2x1 FC on the 900 is good.  I’d probably suggest get the bulkhead seats. \n\nAlso there is Wings For Autism event for those with autism to go through the whole boarding process with TSA and all on Oct 27th in Binghamton NY if that happens to be close \n\nhttps://thearc.org/our-initiatives/travel/\n\n\n\n#teamdelta!', 'The CRJ900 will have a forward lavatory as well. Have your child say hello to the flight deck too, we love having visitors. I would recommend getting the first row bulkhead. Delta first class sounds like the best option.', 'Absolutely not frowned upon to put a kid in First. I see it all the time - do it. If you can afford it and it’s the best option for you and your family, there is no reason why you shouldn’t.', ""I think you're probably worrying about this a little too much. I'm in First Class a couple of times a week, and I see babies and autistic kids all the time. In all those years I've only ever seen one person who made a stink about an unruly kid, and when I told her to stop being a bitch she just sat there and sulked the rest of the flight.\n\nDelta flight attendants are trained on your situation, and as long as you let them know, they will handle it without a hiccup. If you're really concerned, take them some cupcakes or chocolate chip cookies (they don't get much time to eat between flights and love getting snacks) and they'll love you. There are usually two flight attendants on the CRJs."", 'FC in a 900 is not as roomy as the mainline jets. Just to let you know.', 'What’s your routing?', 'Flown with my kids (both on and off the spectrum) when that young in first-class multiple times. I wouldn\'t worry about dirty looks, etc. Tell the crew what\'s going on and if you\'re worried about the ""waiting"" before departure (and for the motion to kick in), you could always board at the very end. Delta, in general, has amazing crews. They\'ll look after you :).', ""That's pretty darn close but we're actually doing a fundraiser for him that day! Thanks so much for the info though, I'll keep looking for more events.\n\nHe's actually a sensory seeker so noise doesn't bother him. I plan on giving him a decongestant in case his ears hurt (and probably some melatonin too - he had a medical procedure in August and we used it to 'sedate' him so he was calm but not really asleep - it worked great for about an hour or so, and if he falls asleep it's a bonus) so that should help.\n\nI think the bulkhead seats are taken already for our flight of choice but not for the return.\n\nI was mostly nervous about the flight crew - you hear so many horror stories that it scares you. We actually drove 12 hours in August from CT to NC just to avoid a plane, but he's been doing so good since school started that I was thinking it might be time to give it a shot."", ""Thanks so much! Bulkhead is already taken for our flight of choice there but available for return. We were going to go with row 2 on the way there.\n\nMost of my nerves come from other people's potential reactions. My son hates long waits but otherwise is pretty well behaved for a 5 year old (nevermind one with Autism) as long as he has stuff to occupy him."", 'I can guarantee the flight crew will do their best. We’re trained to simply ask for what you guys need vs assuming. I always ask “if there’s anything I can do to help you out, let me know, otherwise I’ll just leave you to it and make sure everyone is safe.”', ""Thanks! I was mostly nervous about flight crew and other passengers since there's been so many horror stories the past few years."", ""Thank you. Everything new with him is something to worry about. I plan like crazy so I have multiple back ups if something goes wrong.\n\nThanks for the snack tip - I'll bring a couple goodie bags with sweet and savory snacks for them."", ""JFK to ORD. BDL is closer but the flights are more expensive and there's less of them."", ""Thanks so much! I did plan to board last for that exact reason! Once we're moving he's fine but he's terrible at waiting."", 'I think you got this!', ""Honestly as long as you as the parent aren't completely ignoring the situation if he does get riled up, people will likely be understanding"", 'People can be dicks and this is exacerbated on airplanes. You should still do what’s best for you.', ""Honestly, people are totally understanding these days. Don't stress yourselves out about other people's potential reactions. I've never had a problem flying with understanding people on Delta flights. Whether it's a crying baby or something, it just comes with flying. Now, I haven't had to deal with an emotional support horse on the plane, but maybe that's for next time. :)\n\nHave fun in Chicago with your son! He's gonna love First Class."", ""Thank you! I figured since it's a short flight, Spring Break, and a Saturday morning flight that should hopefully limit the older businessmen on board (which I'm guessing would be our biggest complainers)."", ""Thank you! No one has ever actually said anything to us (my husband is pretty scary looking!) but we've received looks. My husband usually glares back and tells people to mind their own business.\n\nI heard someone once brought a peacock on a plane, claiming it was for emotional support!"", 'Don’t worry about the complainers']"
2,Is Comfort+ worth it for a short domestic flight?,3,dlbeku,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dlbeku/is_comfort_worth_it_for_a_short_domestic_flight/,7,1571740708.0,"Normally when I travel domestically, I stick to JetBlue or Southwest. However, I managed to snag a great deal on a Delta flight even considering the $30 bag fee. Anyway, the trip is RIC->ATL then ATL->MIA, both of which are between 1:30 and 1:45 long. Is it worth paying $35-60 for each leg (or even one leg) given how short the flights are to upgrade from Main Economy to Comfort+? I see a lot of people talking about it as an upgrade or for a much longer and/or international flight, but not really in my situation.","[""I enjoy the dedicated overhead bin space and free drinks, but on short flights like that you aren't going to get many, if at all."", 'Only if you want to make sure your bag makes it on and in a bin, and/or if you want to down a couple of alcoholic bevvies', 'Probably not. You get a little more recline and legroom, but unless you are pretty tall that isn’t worth it.  The seats are normal economy otherwise.  You do get free drinks if that makes a difference!', 'Thanks everyone. It sounds like from the  responses, I\'m better off giving it a pass. I\'m already checking a bag, so if I need to check my carry on, it\'s probably not the biggest deal. I keep my meds, travel docs, and a change of clothes in my backpack anyway so lost luggage isn\'t an issue either. The price tag for ""free"" drinks sounds kind of stupid on a flight that short.', 'How many free drinks?', 'They only do one service, but you can ask for more. It’s not like first class where they come to you and ask if you’d like another though.', 'No limit. Free wine, beer, and spirits. Somewhat upgraded snacks as well.  Slight caveat: the complimentary goodies are only on flights >350 miles.']"
3,Trying to switch,4,ctnmj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/ctnmj9/trying_to_switch/,6,1566452761.0,"So, I decided that I would look into switching loyalty from Jetblue (I'm Mosaic) to Delta. I'm NYC based and fly approximately 12x a year all over, usually one international trip. I have the Delta Amex reserve and have already hit the MQD waiver.  JetBlue has been frustrating with their labor issues (causing delays because of lack of personnel) and their limited footprint - especially International. So I started switching to Delta and have been pleased until today. I am booking travel for a meeting in Palm Springs in November (11/17 not Thanksgiving) and my wife will be accompanying me on this trip. The best fair in Comfort + -was $2200 (with a change in SLC). before booking, I looked at JetBlue and found direct for $689 and then upgraded to even more space (I used points because I'm mosaic  - but would have cost $360) for a street price of about $1050. I dont fly enough to split airlines and keep status on both, not sure if Delta is a good fit. ANyone have any tips I might be missing. Thanks","['Ask Delta for a Status Match?', 'MQD waiver for what status with Delta?  Because there’s also a MQM or MQS component to make a status with Delta. \n\nAnd (I may be wrong about this, as I’m currently airborne on a DL flight) but I don’t think DL will March status with JetBlue. \n\nAgain could be wrong but I seem to remember reading that.', 'Thanks, maybe Ill give that a try after January with 2020 travel', 'I think they give Gold Medallion for Mosaic status:\n\nhttps://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/skymiles/medallion-program/status-match-challenge.html', 'Thanks - see above - good idea.', 'I would say since mosaic is a top tier status they’ll match to platinum.']"
4,Lyft/Delta Skymiles Bonus,20,9uj9nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/9uj9nc/lyftdelta_skymiles_bonus/,18,1541492247.0,"I linked my Skymiles account to my Lyft account to get the $1=1 Skymile (and 2x on airport rides) because I am a twice daily lyft rider. Why the hell not right?

Today I noticed that my skymiles balance was a couple thousand higher than is should be so I checked the account activity. Two Lyft ""Holiday Partner Bonus(es)"" totaling 2500 Skymiles. Not a ton of miles but I appreciate the the thought. I always have loved this partnership.
