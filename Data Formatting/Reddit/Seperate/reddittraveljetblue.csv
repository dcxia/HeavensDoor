1,How can the fares on JetBlue be so different,0,70qde2,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/70qde2/how_can_the_fares_on_jetblue_be_so_different/,1,1505712170.0,"SFO-JFK-MBJ-JFK-SFO

If I book the whole route (1-connection) (one ticket) the cost comes up a $4,100.  If I book two separate fights on JetBlue, the total cost comes to $2351.01.  All the same class of service.

As well, the same flights came up on Priceline at $1,900.

How can this be?",['Ask on /r/travel or somewhere.']

* They have a handy menu of their drinks and snacks in the seat-back pockets.  On some flights they also read out the list.  I recommend the Doritos Munchies Mix.  
* The seats are comfy!  (leather-like, not hard at all, lots of give)
* Don't expect to borrow a blanket or pillow for free.  You have to buy them for $7.  And if the plane's not full, it will be cold!
* They have cable TV and satellite radio, unlike other airlines with movie selections.  Don't forget your earphones; theirs cost $2.
* You can watch a sneak preview of a tv pilot if you want (at least you could last week).  Called something like ""Modern Family.""  Up to you guys, but I tried a few minutes and found it to be god-awful.

Some things I'd be curious to keep track of:

* How many pilots crack jokes?  (mine were 1 of 4; on my last flight the Pilot said, ""We have two of our best Flight Attendants with us today.  And we have Stephanie.""  That put a big grin on her face as she repeated for people in the next 10 minutes that yes, she was Stephanie.)   
* How much of the time do they use their little map-channel where you get to follow where the plane is?  (3 of 4 on mine)  
* How often were flights delayed?  (none of mine in any way)  
* How often did flights land early? (I think 2 of mine did.  Between 10 and 30 min early)","['I like their ""blue"" potato chips which are *actually blue*.

A rough network of collaborators helped to make this happen. The conductors of this railroad risked their livelihood and, most likely, their lives to look beyond societal norms of the day and set out to inform and rescue those who needed it most. The unnamed stations that served to hide those who desired freedom. 

We now have a chance once again to rescue those who yearns for freedom from the daily doldrum of modern living. For the lifers who wake up early in the morning before sunrise and look out to the night for some sign of inspiration that never seems to come. For those who zombies through the daily grind of life, whether it be coursework or corporate, hoping to be reanimated at the end of the day only to be pitched back to the brainless life once the alarm goes off the next day. For they who grasped at their final chance to experience a nomadic life that comes once in a lifetime...or in this case, for the past 2 years. 

I propose we make a _Reddit Crosscountry Highway_ for those who have taken the the JetBlue Challenge and is using it to live life simply on the road. To allow those who want to escape or just to enjoy a new way of living for this brief period.

**For Travelers:**

* *Meeting stations:* Suggest an airport hub or prominent city location to act as a meeting spot for those who desire to travel with another redditor for one leg of the journey and/or beyond
* *Waypoints/Points of Interests:* Suggest a point of interest or event you know coming up that other people taking the journey might enjoy
* *People of interest*: Introduce people you've met on your journey that doesn't use Reddit/don't know about this Highway to those that come to the city after you. (This might need to be done exclusively through PMs as a protection barrier)

**For those not on the journey but inclined to help the travelers:**

* *Agents* to act as guides, willing to show those who visit around their city or even just to offer suggestions on where to go
* *Rest stations* for those who are weary at the end of day: A generous redditor willing to offer up their residence to those who are traveling for the night


Suggestions needed and are quite welcomed.

* Saydrah [asks for more donations](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9c83c/do_you_want_to_send_not_one_but_two_redditors_on/), so that two travelers can be sent, instead of just one.

If you want to be considered to receive the unlimited Jet Blue ticket and spend a month running Redditors' errands and eating bacon in exotic locales, please contact me on AIM (same as my Reddit username) or PM me for an email address. I will want to talk to you by phone to confirm you're a real person. I'll also ask for a picture of you holding up a doodle of the Reddit alien or something like that in order to make sure you're not just human but also who you say you are. Finally, and most invasively, I'll need some personal references who can vouch for your sanity and tendency to behave yourself as a guest.

Yeah, it's a pain, but we're giving you a month-long trip of awesome for it. If you're worried about me using your personal information for evil rather than good, you can ask Redditor Lycurgus to confirm that I'm real and sane.

Edit to Add:

You can now email reddittravel@gmail.com to get in touch with me.

EDIT2: If you choose the email option, please include your username on Reddit and a link to any post you've made in this subreddit stating your case for why you should be our traveler. Thanks!

It is clear that this project is incredibly popular. An entire forum (subreddit) has popped up in the last 12 hours, devoted to making this trip the best it can be: http://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/ .\n\n> I hope JetBlue will consider contributing an additional All You Can Jet pass for a cameraman and companion, or providing other support to our traveler. reddit.com receives over 6 million unique visitors monthly, and a small gesture from your company would have both high impact and high visibility.\n\n>Thank you,\n>My Name\n\nThe original email:\n\n>Reddit.com, a Conde Nast/Wired web property, is one of the largest social news websites, with a vibrant community of young, affluent, largely US-based readers and members. There was a post on reddit advising other redditors of the All You Can Jet Deal, and a reddit member proposed an interesting idea. Reddit members will raise funds to buy a $600 unlimited flights pass on JetBlue, then fly one individual, selected by the votes of members, on a month of adventures, facilitated by reddit members in the various JetBlue destinations. The individual will be required to document his journey through a blog with photos and video, and his destinations and activities will be selected by the reddit community.\n\n> I believe this presents an opportunity for JetBlue. If JetBlue matched donations or provided some other financial or logistical support, this has a greater chance of being a success. Having a second individual financed to be the cameraman would be an example of great support that would increase the quality (and therefore popularity) of the content produced. Reddit's demographic is JetBlue's target demographic, and this project would provide great exposure at one of the centers of new media.\n\n> We only have three days until the deadline for purchasing a ticket, and we're working to get this off the ground as fast as we can.\n\n>Thank you for your consideration,\n> ME\n"", ""Zaidy's?

So a few years ago, like in 2007 or something, I had purchased a round trip ticket from Jet Blue from Long Beach, CA to JFK or LGA (I forgot which it was, but it was NY).  I was scheduled to return to Long Beach on Monday, leaving at 6am in the morning.  At around 11 pm at night, as I am sleeping, I get a phone call.  I finally decide to answer it but it's already gone to voicemail.  Turns out to be a recorded message saying ""due to weather conditions, your Jet Blue flight has been cancelled.  Please check jetblue.com to reschedule your flight"".  So I immediately log on to jetblue and discover that ALL the flights to Long Beach are booked until WEDNESDAY.  So i call them and beg them to get me on a flight because I have to get to work on Monday.  Sorry, they say, we are booked until Wednesday.  What's that?  Oh, sorry we don't partner with other airlines so we can't get you on another flight with anyone else.  What's that? Oh, I'm really sorry, I know it's not raining but it might be tomorrow morning.  What's that?  Oh, don't worry, we will refund you the unused portion of your ticket. 

God I was pissed.  I had to go to Delta to get a flight out at 5pm and got back to Los Angeles at 11 pm and I paid $800, that was the CHEAPEST one way ticket they had for Monday.  Jet Blue refused to re-imburse me for it.  The worst part of it was that Delta is based out of LAX.  So after I got back, I had to hail a cab to drive me to Long Beach to pick up my car at Jet Blue.  They even refused to pay for that!  I was so mad I called them after fuming about it for a few days and they gave me a link and told me to fill out my complaint (or send an email to someone, I forgot, it was a while ago) so I did that and they sent me a $50 gift voucher for a future Jet Blue flight.  Sorry, that's the best we can do sir.  

It was the worst experience I ever had with an airline.","['You are totally in the wrong place. ', ""That's not with this subreddit is about.
