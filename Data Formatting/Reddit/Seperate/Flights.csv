0,JetBlue lost bag. What should I be expecting/do?,10,cyb6ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/cyb6ns/jetblue_lost_bag_what_should_i_be_expectingdo/,1,1567379916.0,"Arrived at baggage claim, but my bag was not there. The JetBlue rep I spoke too wasn’t sure if my bag left my departure point or not. It’s also possible it was stolen. Hopefully it turns up soon, but it was a huge duffel bag with virtually all my clothes in it, upwards of $400-$500 worth of clothes. Almost none of that am I going to have receipts for.

I dont mind paying a little more to fly with an airline that is generally going to provide a better experience.,"['It all depends upon what you purchase.  For domestic flights, if you\'re going for First Class level, all three of the major airlines (Delta, American, United) are similar enough and will generally give you a good experience.  JetBlue has ""Mint"" service on some routes that is also very nice.  Note, though, that if your flight is less than 3 hours, it really isn\'t cost-effective to pay extra for First class.  In economy, again, the three biggies are similar.  But, Delta tends to rise just a bit higher with a tad more room, IFE, and just a generally better experience.  However, they also tend to be a little more expensive.  Alaska Air and JetBlue also have a good economy setup.  You can spring for ""Comfort Plus"" or ""Economy Extra"" (or various other names for the same service) that will afford you slightly more legroom but in an economy seat.  American and United just give you more legroom in this section, but no other amenities.  Delta, in their Comfort +, gives you more legroom and additional amenities like priority boarding, free drinks,  upgraded snacks.  \n\nLCCs, or ""Low Cost Carriers"" like Spirit, Frontier, and others, give you the worst experience.  They\'ll get you to your destination, but often at the expense of your comfort and convenience.  Many times, because they charge extra for things the others include in their fare, the price may turn out to not be as good of a bargain as you\'d think.  Also, be sure you\'re not getting a ""Basic Economy"" fare on any of the airlines.  Those are rarely a real bargain as you\'re often limited on what you can carry on, can\'t select your seats, board last, and are often stuck in a middle seat away from your travel mates.\nSo, my advice: pick any of the major airlines (Delta, American, United, JetBlue, Alaska) and if the flight is around 3 hours or less, just get an ""Economy Plus"" (Comfort +, Main Cabin Extra, Premium Economy, etc.) and enjoy your trip!', 'First class', 'All the major US Airlines (American, Delta, Southwest, United) are fairly similar in quality.

Especially if you could fly with Alaska airlines, because they allow you to use the airport lounge prior to your flight- there are free snacks and free flowing drinks, which is nice. In the event there’s no Alaska, or no first class (or if first is too prohibitively expensive), a great middle ground is to fly in an economy plus seat.

The trip is about 3 months out.  JetBlue had nonstop options, good times, and decent prices.  However, once I settled on the dates and times, the prices kept creeping higher.

They claim that the price often rises, but falls back as the dates get closer.  

Help me not panic that I missed the best deal.  So far, the best times and dates for us have risen by $500 total.  Also, since JetBlue doesn't really have a deal for round trip, should I grab the return flight now that it is at a good price and monitor just the outgoing flight price?

30,Travel Card vs Airline Card,4,9j6sdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/9j6sdm/travel_card_vs_airline_card/,3,1538026474.0,"Hi all,

Just looking for third party opinions about having a travel card vs an airline card as your main credit card. I'm not really interested in jumping between a bunch of cards based on transaction A vs transaction B. I have the option to upgrade my Chase Sapphire Preferred to a Reserve, and I'm wondering now that I've achieved Mosaic status on JetBlue, if I should keep using my JetBlue Plus card. I just achieved Mosaic status this month because of spend ($50,000). I didn't earn it via flying. But I like having status, given I don't really have status with anything.

&#x200B;

So, in your mind, anecdotally and purely based on your gut feelings, Chase Sapphire Reserve + Chase Freedom Unlimited combo (most likely with no status) or continuing using my JetBlue Plus card and maintain my Mosaic status now and forever?","[""Chase UR points open up a lot more travel possibilities than an airline specific card. Most flights, rental cars, some hotels. The points are very valuable. And since you just got status it's the perfect time to grab something new. \n\nQuick comment on upgrading your card: have you had it more than 4 years? if so, it would be better to downgrade the card and apply for a new Chase Sapphire Reserve so you can qualify for the 50k UR welcome bonus (worth $750 when redeemed for travel). (need to downgrade first because of Chase 1 Sapphire rule and gap between Sapphire bonuses was just extended to 4 years). \n\nChase has a whole family of other UR earning cards that work together very nicely. I'd point you in the direction of r/churning for a subreddit all about getting credit cards and traveling for free. \n\nIf you'e spending $50k a year, you could easily be raking in a lot of free trips. (most cards require $5k spend in 3 months). "", 'You don\'t fly, so you want status not for benefits, but only to ""have status""?', ""I fly roughly once a month for work to Las Vegas (from JFK). So, I do fly, but not often enough to achieve a meaningful level of status with someone like Delta. Even with the occasional personal flight (maybe once a quarter, if that), it seems like legacy airline status is out of reach. Generally speaking, you have to fly 30 segments or 25,000 miles. New York to Las Vegas 12 times a year (and that's if I were to fly every month without fail, which isn't the case), wouldn't be enough. Even with the occasional odd trip for pleasure.\n\nThe dilemma is admittedly driven at least in part by a feeling of frustration whenever I fly with colleagues. They've undoubtedly earned their Delta stripes and as a result, get upgraded to first class just about every time we fly together on Delta. I believe they all have Platinum status. I am fully aware of how ridiculous that sounds. I know: Why should I care? But nevertheless, I do, and it’s a factor.\n\nPart of attraction for JetBlue is that it's kind of a class-less airline. Unless you're on a Mint route, everyone's more or less on even an playing field. So, there's less FOMO. I also just like their brand's values. And finally, as a Queens-native, I LOVE that they're a Queens, NY-born airline. There's an intangible X-factor about that which I love.\n\nThat being said, I hear you, DrCalamari. I think our high spending is a big reason why I've been considering the switch. The Reserve's 3X for dining and travel makes it difficult to ignore. Preferred's 2X was tough, but easier to pass on, consider JetBlue Plus also gives 2X on dining (and groceries — which I spend more on per month than travel).""]"
31,Advice on which rewards plan/airline to utilize,4,9crzp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/9crzp1/advice_on_which_rewards_planairline_to_utilize/,14,1536060220.0,"Hello,

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

​

​","['Rule out JetBlue because they only fly to JFK and BOS from SAN, so while they might work for your northeast travels they won’t help you for the midwest. \n\nSouthwest is the dominant airline at SAN but they don’t have extra legroom seats and lack power ports which might make it hard to work through the flight. \n\nPretty much all airlines with extra legroom seats will let you book them if you pay extra for them. Are you looking for one that will let you book the extra legroom seats for free once you achieve an elite status level in their frequent flyer program?', ""Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, but I'm not seeing the differences between the airlines you mentioned regarding their approach to seats with extra legroom. If you don't have status, you have to pay for it. So this isn't a deciding factor. But basic seats on JetBlue tend to have slightly more legroom. "", 'Thank you for taking the time to comment. I apologize for my lack of clarity. After discussing with another commenter I realized I was confused about the ""Extra"" packages and that they\'re similar across all main airlines. And since domestic travel is apparently insufficient for status, though I am planning on doing some international traveling next summer, I am unsure if there is any value to sticking with 1 rewards program. With my situation, do you think this is the best course of action?', 'Sorry for the confusion, some airlines let you buy exit row in advance, unbundled with ""premium"" features without being status (i.e. American), while others don\'t (Alaska, United, Delta). But I am willing to stick with one of the latter airlines if their rewards plan or coverage is much better. Do you have any advice on that? \n\nThanks!', 'I read through the other conversation too. You\'re right that to get the extra legroom seats with Delta, you have to buy Comfort+ as a separate class of travel, whereas with United you can buy a regular Economy/Coach ticket and then choose and pay extra for an Economy Plus seat, which sounds like what you want. I think American does something similar with Main Cabin Extra, though I don\'t know how much of their domestic fleet has MCE as something more than just the bulkhead and exit rows. Be wary of American\'s ""preferred"" seats, which are regular seats but towards the front of the plane. No extra legroom or anything with those.\n\nAlaska looks the same as United with ""Premium Class"" seats being economy class tickets that you pay extra to choose those seats.\n\nOne thing you might consider is United offers a ""subscription"" to Economy Plus, where you pay a one time fee ($499 for domestic US excluding Alaska and Hawaii) and that lets you select Economy Plus seating for an entire year. You\'d have to consider if you\'ll fly enough to make it pay off to do this rather than buying Economy Plus each time, and that also means you\'d basically be dedicated to United. https://www.united.com/CMS/en-US/products/travelproducts/Pages/EconomyPlus.aspx\n\nOne thing to watch out for is Basic Economy fares. You\'re not going to get the option of an extra legroom seat with those.', '> domestic travel is apparently insufficient for status\n\nThat depends entirely on how much you are traveling.

In contrast, Westjet lets you pay say 30$ for booking exit row but gives you the same economy experience. Because I will not have status, upgrades are expensive, so I want airlines that just let me pay for the seats.\n\nI checked for AA for SAN to LGA and I could buy a seat for 75$ while Delta was 120$.

If you're going to be price - sensitive, just book the cheaper flights. Collect points, of course, but you are unlikely to achieve status with repeated domestic flights. *Maybe* you might achieve first tier after ten transcontinental flights, especially if you have a foreign address to avoid United and Delta's spending requirements. "", ""Thank you for clearing things up for me, I realize now that I was not reading things properly. I have a Canadian address but if domestic flights don't do much, then I guess there's no point overthinking it. Will try to stay economical and maybe consider which airline CC has a better offer. "", ""It's not so much that domestic flights themselves don't do much. It's just that the main US airlines (AA, Delta, and United) instituted spending requirements to reach status level, and it's usually tough for leisure travelers to achieve. However, if you are not a US resident (ahem), then you can be exempt for Delta and United.\n\nWith first tier on all three, I believe you are entitled to free extra legroom seats at check-in. That's the only benefit somewhat worth it there, as you can get a credit card that gives you (almost) everything else. ""]"

It’s doable to get 5 tickets for under $1000 just need to watch the airline prices and research for the best time. Obviously your choosing to fly during the worst week being Easter week/spring break. Would recommend maybe doing something more towards late August or early September if possible. ', 'Spring break.  Tickets are cheap from after new years until the end of Feb.

Need to get from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Kharkiv, Ukraine (HRK). Go to Google Flights. Find the perfect trip I need.

Depart on Nov. 13 from Pittsburgh to Boston, Boston to JFK on JetBlue. Then I board Turkish to Istanbul, Istanbul to Kharkiv. 

Return Dec. 13 from Kharkiv to Istanbul, Istanbul to Boston on Turkish. Then I take a JetBlue from Boston to Pittsburgh. 

I call Turkish, they tell me to book online to save $50. I hang up, try to book through Turkish website, it's $3002. So I call back and talk to another woman. She now says that Turkish can't book the JetBlue flights. So I call JetBlue, they say to book through a travel agent.

So why does Google Flights give me this option as a 1-ticket trip? Is Turkish lying, or is Google lying? Is there any other options?   

UPDATE: Got the flight book. Used my Russian travel agent who had access to book it all on 1 ticket.

I bought the ticket on JetBlue and the BOS->BHB leg is on Cape Air, a codeshare partner (so all 1 ticket). When I bought the ticket weeks ago, I had a 40 minute connection in Boston. I just got notified of a schedule change reducing it to a 10 minute connection, which means I'll probably need to reschedule. 

My question is, what can I expect JetBlue to do for me? 

I'm already on the earliest flight I can get to BOS (on any airline). The next flight to Bar Harbor is 4 hours later, and hotels near BOS are looking really expensive, so flying in the night before isn't really an option unless I could get JetBlue to pay for it. If I get stuck with the 4 hour delay, could I get some sort of compensation?","[""You don't need much preparation for this. Just call them and ask.\n\nYou are free to ask for some sort of compensation, but I'm not sure why you think you're entitled to anything. A 4-hour delay is not particularly long and can happen for a number of reasons. You at least have the benefit of getting advance notice. If there is something mission critical you were hoping to get to, you can take a refund and book alternate flights.\n\nThink of it this way. Let's pretend that you didn't book your flight until now.

But, since there's not much I can do about in either case, that's not much of a benefit.\n\n> Let's pretend that you didn't book your flight until now. You'd be left with the same options.\n\nNot necessarily. I wouldn't be tied to Jetblue for the first leg. They're not Cape Air's only partner, and not the only airline with nonstops between CLE and BOS, just the earliest one, which no longer matters. If another airline offered a significantly better price, I may have made a different choice. \n\n> There is no reason you'd be entitled \n\nJust wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

She's flying with JetBlue from RDU to JFK, then TAP from JFK to France via Portugal. We booked the flights as ""one itinerary"" so they are all classed as connecting flights, to my understanding. We booked everything with TAP.

JetBlue just emailed us and said the first flight is cancelled due to the weather. I phoned JetBlue and they said ""our system is down, we can't help you, you booked entirely with TAP; go to them"". Their online function is broken to change flights.

I phoned TAP and they said ""well our flights aren't cancelled, that's your problem if Jetblue cancels"" - even though we booked entirely through TAP.

I have absolutely, no idea where to start. I'm in JetBlue's 30 minute+ telephone queue right now, any advice urgently would be appreciated on what to do here.
