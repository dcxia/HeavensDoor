8,(Relatively) Frequent transcon Flyer out of JFK debating status - worth it at my level?,2,d7yn3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/d7yn3r/relatively_frequent_transcon_flyer_out_of_jfk/,13,1569225533.0,"I've been flying for business more frequently for a little over a year now and reflecting on the numbers, I'm wondering whether I should more seriously pursue some level of status with an airline for 2020 (I got geeky and made an Airtable base to track flight mileage).

I didn't take it too seriously before and have mostly flown JetBlue because I don't/didn't think I'd fly enough to get any worthwhile status on another airline, but am reconsidering and would love some thoughts from the group here. I really like their product and service all around and the frequency/timing of direct flights from JFK to the west coast, but realizing even if I hit Mosaic status, it's not really helpful as you don't get upgrades with it, and with no alliance/without many partners, I mainly get more JetBlue flights.

I also have heard from many people (and here) that since there are so many hardcore business flyers out of JFK, the odds of getting regular upgrades on my routes at a lower tier of status are pretty slim. Would consider opening another credit card to speed up/amplify benefits/miles earned. Currently use my CSR for everything.

My priority is to make my primary travel (to the West Coast) as comfortable as possible, but miles and upgrades for my vacations and other trips would be a nice bonus, just not sure I'll get any of them. I like JetBlue & Alaska (experiences, product, companies), am indifferent to AA/Delta, and despise United (plus don't want to be stuck with everything being out of EWR).

I like Delta's ~~transfer partners~~ alliance a bit more and my recent research makes me think I'd do okay with them. How's the product on the transcon flights on the 757? Would I actually \_get\_ any upgrades with Delta gold? (Maybe could even squeeze out Platinum if I shifted some of my other travel).

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

Stats:

* I'm based in NYC, my preferred airport (by a long stretch) is JFK.
* Generally, I fly to the West Coast (SFO or LAX) for work at least 6 times a year, as well as various other ad hoc trips. Most domestic, but occassional international popping up as well. I'd generally be in Premium Economy but can sometimes get Business Class fares in my range.
* For personal travel, my future MIL is based in LA, so we usually go out there at least 2 more times a year. Plus other trips/vacations (3-4 times a year, sometimes domestic, sometimes international- South America and Europe recently and the near future).
* I'm on track to fly a little over 55k miles this year, likely the same or more next year as well.","['You should scope Alaska. Based on your mileage, you’d be at least mvp gold which would get you upgrades to first class at least 30% of the time I would guess? Plus people flying with you would get those upgrades too. Their international partners are solid and mileage is accrued based on miles flown. Plus they match status easily.', 'There\'s no such thing as Delta ""transfer partners"".', 'I find that having status makes it worth it to focus on one airline. \n\nFirst, estimate your yearly spend on airfare and see whether it’s going to meet the qualifying dollars threshold at the gold level at least. For Delta, that’s $6k. Entry level elite status is not worth working toward. If you can hit the qualifying dollars mark easily (and keep in mind that taxes and fees don’t count toward the total) then if you fall short on the miles (50K for gold) you can take some cheap overseas vacations to earn more miles. \n\nFor me, the most reliably useful elite perk (I’m a United Platinum) is being able to switch to an earlier or later flight with no fee. And the nicest perk is to always get the extra legroom seats. You’ll want to examine the Delta and AA perks to see how likely you are to benefit. United, for you wouldn’t be an option since their hub is EWR.', 'The AA 321T (JFK-LAX & JFK-SFO) is excellent, even in economy. Other AA equipment I’d rank just below JetBlue for product quality. \n\n55K miles per year will just clear platinum status on AA (assuming $6k spend also).  You will rarely get upgrades on those routes at platinum status and if you do, you have to pay with 500 mile upgrades - so 5 of those each way out of pocket ($200 if not gained through flying). You will get MCE selection for free though, which is worth something. \n\nIf you fly odd hours/days or change planes, you may pick up an upgrade here or there and never, ever on a transcontinental red eye. \n\nSince it is close to the end of the year, fly as many of your top picks as you can and judge based on what is important to you. I did this when I started and ruled out United pretty quickly. \n\nIf you fly Premium Economy on AA metal, you will get 150% EQM credit. So a JFK-LHR RT will get you about 10k EQM. \n\nIf you choose AA, you can add the Citibank card that gets you into the admirals club and can get you another 10k EQM with $40k spend/year.  Not many other ways out there to pad EQMs unfortunately. \n\nAlso, there is the tried and true mileage run to bump your status.', ""Alaska has you covered. You'll easily earn status with the amount of flying you plan to do. Is it meaningful? On these routes, probably yes--Alaska has far fewer elites so you'll likely score the occasional upgrade. The main reason to do it isn't upgrades, but because you'll accrue so many valuable Mileage Plan miles. They still give you a Mileage Plan mile for every mile flown, and their chart is one of the best and cheapest out there. You'll also get a considerable earnings multiplier based on your elite status."", ""The ability to hop on an earlier flight is a reason to maintain even basic elite status on AA or United. If you fly transcon, there will often be flights every hour. It's been a godsend for me. I'm not in control of my schedule so I typically book a latish flight, then just move to an earlier one if possible. It makes such a difference."", 'Keep in mind you can also work around some qualifying dollars requirements through credit card spend. I rack up all my miles on cheap overseas fares and get the requirement waived by spending 25k on the United Visa card every year.', 'I was thinking this but it seems they added a number of segment requirements- am I misreading this?', 'In CC points mode, corrected.', ""I flew on the AA A321T last year and agree, the product was very good. Also since it's a three class cabin on a small plane, I noticed how not crowded it was (so boarding was fast, service was really good, etc.).\n\nThanks for the feedback on upgrade availability- I figured as much.\n\nWill definitely be trying something new on my next trip!"", 'Alaska also allows same day changes.', ""You are.

9,San Juan trip in January,6,d7wijq,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/d7wijq/san_juan_trip_in_january/,8,1569215072.0,"My partner and I are going on a cruise in January that departs from San Juan on 1/4, returning 1/14.   We booked the cruise in cash via Costco Travel (very happy with the deal we got there), but we now need airfare and pre-cruise hotel.  I have some options but I'd love to know if there's something better.  I have \~100K each Chase UR points and AMEX points, and \~75K CapitalOne points.  Gold Status with United and Marriot, but not many points banked in either.

**Flights**

RT travel PHL -> SJU, 1/3/2020, returning 1/14/2020.  2 people, economy is fine.  

Outbound flights appear to be \~double the cost of return flights.

AA is hubbed in PHL and flies direct, \~$560 cash -> 76K Chase points via Chase travel.  I don't have enough AA points to book through them directly, and I don't know of any way to transfer in.

BA only offers reward flights for the return, non-direct (8h vs 3.5h) for 36K Avios total = \~25K MR points at current rates.  Then I could book the outbound leg via Chase points for \~48K, total price 73K.  That helps me use some MR points (which I've been having difficulty doing) but is a much crappier return flight.

I can't find any United Saver availability, and JetBlue and Delta would each take close to 100K points for the trip.  SW doesn't fly there on our dates.

Short answer, I think I need to book with Chase UR points.  I know the 1.5 cent value isn't the best I can get, but I don't think I can do any better on this trip.

&#x200B;

**Hotel**

Marriott has one Category 3 hotel in San Juan, a Courtyard, which is bookable for 17.5K points, or 14K Amex points with the current transfer bonus.  The hotel is currently booking for $250 per night, which seems par for other hotels in downtown San Juan.  This seems like a slam dunk - anybody see any downsides?","[""If you have any UR left, you could do Hyatt Place San Juan or just book in cash.

Usually, the first couple weeks of December and January are the lease expensive cruise periods. \n\nI assume you\'ve looked at trying to book AA saaver space using BA Avios. That would my best suggestion. \n\nYou could do Spirit or frontier for less cash but no points options. Remember the bag fees will add with them though. \n\nMake sure to check to book 2 one-way tickets or awards for options. For example, you might find awards one-way but not the other or better pricing that way, etc. \n\nAlso, check Momondo and Skyscanner besides Google flights for cash options. Checking other nearby\'ish airports like NYC might be a thought as well. Good luck and enjoy your cruise. \n\nOh and remember that some of the cruise lines may use the Pan American Port East of downtown and not the main downtown traditional port. You likely know that or will find it on their website, etc. RC, NCL, Disney, and Celebrity do this at times. Just guessing on the dates it looks like you are on Celebrity Summit. I cruised this ship last October and it is very nice. We did dock at the Pan American port on that cruise.', 'Indeed.

19,Offered free Gold Status on AA for 3 months even though I typically fly United. Worth booking upcoming flights on AA instead of United?,17,c2bqfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/c2bqfl/offered_free_gold_status_on_aa_for_3_months_even/,45,1560942346.0,"I checked my e-mail today and found American Airlines offered me free gold status until 9/25. The promotion is to maintain gold through Jan 2021 by spending $850 EQD and going 7,000 EQMs by 9/25.

This came as a surprise as I am not a loyal AA flyer. I fly somewhat often for work, ranging from 3-6 days a month. I have 9.9K miles on AA, about 6K flown this year from trips to Vegas, Miami, and Boston.

&#x200B;

My upcoming trips (none of are booked yet):

\-RT DC to Madison for work (highly likely)

\-RT DC to Orlando for work

\-RT DC to San Francisco for work

\-1 way DC to Boston (other way is  on Jetblue, this was a personal trip so I went with who was cheaper)

&#x200B;

Looking at my trips above and roughly calculating cost, it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation. (I'll likely have one other work trip thrown in, but these are confirmed) which would get me to gold on AA through 2021. However, I typically fly United since I grew up near a hub and tried to stay somewhat loyal when convenient and/or affordable. I have 27K miles on United but not any status (and a RT flight to Spain booked on United). I was planning to book all of my above trips on United for this reason, to keep accruing miles.

&#x200B;

So my question is:

1. Should I switch plans and book all of my upcoming trips on AA instead of United to hit the promotion? Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?
2. Would it make sense to abandon loyalty to United and start flying AA going forward? I feel like if I switched to AA with the promotion I'm dividing up my miles and not really highly accruing on either (I'dbe about even on both airlines by Sept.)

&#x200B;

Some Notes:

\-I care more about being able to accrue miles (maybe to book a free trip in the near future) than say upgrades. The extra legroom perk would be nice since I'm tall but I wouldn't give up accruing more miles on one airline for that, especially since I can expense it for work flights on longer trips anyway.

\-I don't have a travel credit card except the Uber Barclays Card (3% cahs back regardless of brand).

\-I live close to DCA (an AA hub). United also flies out of DCA and has a hub in Dulles which isn't so far

\-I don't have strong feelings one way or the other about the brands. I've generally never had a problem on either.

\-For what it's worth, I'm silver on Marriott which has some kind of partnership with United

&#x200B;

Any help from those who are travel savvy or better understand the point system is appreciated!","['Stay with one airline. I am a loyal AAflier - 150+ flights last year, but we are suffering from lots of mechanical delays due to union struggles and there have been lots of weather issues. Also, not enough planes with Max grounding and the MD-80s coming out of service. I see no reason to diversify under the current conditions. Plus, with the combo of AA and US airways - gold means nothing, pretty much. So many people have status.', "" *it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought bonus/elite miles didn't count towards EQM, that's fixed."", ""This doesn't answer most of your questions, but Marriott status only gets you elevated United status if you're titanium elite or above, which is a long way from silver."", ""I agree with most other people in that AA gold isn't anything to get too excited about especially based on the perks you do care about. One thing worth considering is status match. If you can get AA gold, what would united match it to and since its your preferred airline would that be worth losing 7k+ miles for?"", '>Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?\n\nOne thing as /u/totallynotabotAF mentioned is your calculation for EQM is off. EQM is not the miles you accrue as 7x per $. That\'s just miles. EQM or ""Qualification Miles"" is different- it\'s equal to the physical miles flown between places. [http://www.gcmap.com/](http://www.gcmap.com/) is a great resource for calculating physical miles for your trips. For example, here are some numbers:\n\n \n\nDCA-MSN: 707 miles one way\n\nDCA-MCO: 759 miles one way\n\nDCA-SFO: 2,442 miles one way\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if you want to calculate the EQMs from the above trips, add them and multiply by 2 (round-trip). In your case, it is 7800 which is above 7,000 threshold. In general, coast-to-coast flying is the one which matters the most domestically to get EQMs.  $ 850 sounds doable for these 3 round trips easily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ""promotion"" you have been targeted for is called a status match in general, although it\'s not very common to be offered unless you already have a status with another airline. I like you don\'t care too much about upgrades etc. The only appeal of status to me is accruing more miles. I don\'t have strong opinions on accruing miles for 2 different programs vs. 1. On the negative side as you said it\'s fragmenting the miles, and when you need to book a free trip you don\'t have enough miles on either airline. On the plus side, a lot of these airlines devalue their points a lot. So if you have 100,000 United miles and suddenly they devalue it tomorrow, your points are worth a lot less suddenly. So then you can do more with your other miles. Although in US, it\'s common for all these airline programs to devalue it in sync (except Alaska which still has an excellent mileage program, but doesn\'t make sense for someone living in East Coast).', ""Gold isn't worth much tbh but the thresholds they've set you are pretty low.\n\nAlso not sure I agree with your loyalty to United (ex IAD I assume) vs American from a purely airport perspective.

38,Airline Award Booking Basics,329,aox4xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/aox4xe/airline_award_booking_basics/,64,1549777563.0,"#Airline Award Booking Basics
Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say “Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what?”

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program’s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program’s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline’s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won’t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don’t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE’s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR’s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let’s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don’t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are “Savers” awards, and “Anytime” awards.  

“Savers” are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline’s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

“Anytime” are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I’m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay’s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it’s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It’s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United’s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let’s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don’t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won’t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don’t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can’t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don’t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven’t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let’s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline’s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like “Use Miles”.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let’s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn’t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline’s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people’s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for “Mixed Class”, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can’t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let’s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it’s own, but I’ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people’s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don’t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline’s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip…

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can’t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You’ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don’t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you’ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state “On Request”.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to “Ticketed”.  In the past, I’ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline’s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline’s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don’t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn’t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don’t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

39,RTW full time traveling,5,btkk41,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/btkk41/rtw_full_time_traveling/,24,1558982830.0,"Good morning guys! Has anyone done full time travel around the world and used points to offset the cost of it? My SO and I are planning to do this March 2020 for a year or so so we’re in process of planning it right now. 

I’m curious if anyone has done something like this and how they used their points. Did you do ANA RTW tickets or use points for individual flights as needed? 

I’m sitting on about:

140k UR
135k MR
66k TYP
135k Marriott Points
45k IHG
118 Hyatt
162k Delta
28k JetBlue

Will be getting more cards for signup bonus from now till departure to maximize on points for this long trip just trying to find the best strategy. 

Thanks for any input!","[""I'm doing this, yes. No major strategy really. I just continue to accumulate points and redeem them for point to point travel as needed."", ""This isn't a very good points bank to accomplish what you're after. I helped a couple do a similar journey and we spent about a million Amex and Chase points along with a healthy Marriott points balance (air+hotel package). Nearly all of the flights were in first and business class, along with some luxury hotel stays (which my clients booked on their own--we don't do hotels). They took an epic journey through Asia (including a lot of places off the beaten path in China we helped them discover), visited Fiji, went all over India, and lots of places in Europe as well.\n\nI recommend you step up your game--a lot. Churn literally all you can. And when you're ready to plan your trip, do consider using an award booking service. This is the kind of trip where services like ours really shine. We're pretty good, but so is our competition. Anyone you work with will likely save you much more than the fees you pay. It's also good to get travel planning advice from people who have experience with your planned destinations. There are a lot of places *just* off the beaten path that are amazing to visit, but can also stretch your budget a lot further."", ""I did this/am doing this.  \n\n\nIt's mostly just a matter of always checking all the options. In many many places, cash tickets are so cheap that it isn't worth the points. I've mainly ended up using points on trans-oceanic flights (7 trans pacific flights from AA, 2 with ANA, 1 trans atlantic with Delta, 2 Trans Atlantic with Air France)."", ""I did 6 months from LA to Melbourne to Johannesburg to Spain to NYC to LA. There were other flights in between that I paid cash (anything under $400-500; like a crazy $200 cape Town to Athens via Cairo!). \n\nI prebooked all the major transcontinental flights early. Off-season awards and advance planning forces you to somewhat set your itinerary but also is the cheapest use of miles. \n\nWe camped a lot but also tried to use hotel points on offer deals that give you points back (like IHG 5000 points for x amount spent) that usually paid for itself. \n\nI think most importantly, pack light. \n\nMy recommendation for travel: fly to joeburg, rent a car (pay the proper state cross fees) drive through Botswana to Namibia and end in windhoek or make the drive down to cape Town. It'll be the best part of your trip."", 'I am also doing this currently (\\~9 months). The biggest takeaways I\'ve had to date:  \n\n\n0) Make sure you\'ve applied for any mileage credit retroactively if (like us) you were too lazy to put your FF number when booking :)\n\n1) Cards with immediately accessible numbers are worth their weight in gold.\n\n2) Not all banks are compatible with Google Pay (I don\'t know about Apple Pay).  \n3) Since this sort of travel is highly variable and flexibility is important to us, we employ a strategy I affectionately call ""war chesting"". Basically, figure out the minimum viable point value for an alliance to be useful (eg 40k Asia -> Europe economy oneworld via AA) and target those as minimums when picking the next card to apply for.\n\n4) [deltaairbnb.com](https://deltaairbnb.com) (and all the other clickthrough online portals) are FANTASTIC. I wish I knew about these when we were buying stuff for the trip.  \n5) I never bother with hotel cards, they seem largely more complicated than they are worth.  \n6) When redeeming, I generally just look for a value around or above the commonly cited cpp (eg 1.3cpp MileagePlus, 1.2cpp Skymiles). Since you\'re just keeping cash in pocket, it\'s not worth waiting for a perfect redemption.  \n\n\n/r/churning is also a great resource, if you have not been there already!', ""I've been traveling since September but mainly in Southeast Asia where AirAsia is so cheap that using points hasn't made a ton of sense. In the beginning, I spent a lot of time running all the numbers and comparing prices vs points to see what worked. In general, I found it hard to use my airline points for flights unless I booked way in advance which isn't my style. I probably plan out 6 weeks in advance if that. \n\nI know that using airline points for hotels doesn't always make sense but after doing a lot of budget hotels, every so often, I want a splurge. So for example, I booked the Grand Hyatt in Macau using some United miles. It was totally worth it for me as it was primarily a cashflow issue. I didn't  really have $600+ to spend but I did have a ton of miles. I also figured it I was going to do Macau, I should splurge a bit.\n\nChase Sapphire Rewards is great for the Priority Pass membership. I've spent more time in Priority Pass lounges than I ever thought I would. Such a great benefit. Just make sure you set it all up before you travel. (I say this because friends of mine thought they could just show their credit card and it doesn't work like that.) \n\nMake sure you also register for all the bonus offers. For example, IHG is always having small bonuses for x stays in y months but you have to register. British Airways is doing double-Avios right now but you have to register. So every month or so, I go through all my program emails and make sure I'm not missing anything. \n\nWatch expiration dates. My Hilton points expired before I could use them. :( \n\nLastly -- make sure you know which flights will qualify for which miles/status. I just assumed an Eva Air flight would qualify for United status....I got the points but they were non-qualifying which bums me out because that was a long flight!"", ""Currently doing this since January. Went to Peru and Uruguay to visit family when I left the US. Then to Europe where I am currently. I use miles for long-haul business tickets, points for low category hotels, cash for airbnbs and cheap short-haul tickets. I'm sitting on 4.5 million miles and points. Burnt about 1.5M since I started churning 3 years ago. I keep getting cards but at a much slower pace and went from $20k/month MS to $0. I don't miss it though.

Since it's so far in the future, we have plenty of time to earn more points and miles before actually booking tickets, but right now I'm trying to figure out a general itinerary. 

Between the two of us, we have the following:

* 380k UR
* 270k MR
* 35k ThankYou
* 56k Southwest
* 31k Delta
* 10k United
* 36k Alaska
* 162k AA
* 18k BA
* 9k JetBlue

plus additional hotel points. My husband has an additional 50k UR pending. He is under 5/24, and I am not.

We want to spend about 3 weeks in Europe. We want to focus on Germany, but probably visit one to two other places while we are there--I'm thinking perhaps Amsterdam, somewhere in Belgium, and then cities in western Germany, but this is very flexible at this point. He has family in Stuttgart that we would consider visiting. We went to Switzerland in December 2018 and don't have any serious desire to return this soon. 

We will be traveling with at least two children--they will be 15 and 9 at that point, so visiting locations that they will enjoy will be key. We may also have an 18-month-old at that time, but whether he/she comes with us or not is also in question. (Baby is not born yet.) My husband and I want to fly in business and the 15 and 9 year old will fly economy. If the 18 month old is with us he/she will likely be a lap infant. Since the kids will fly economy, I'm open to booking their tickets with cash if we can get a great price on the same flights my husband and I would be on. We fly out of TPA but can easily get to MCO and can less easily get to MIA. We would prefer to go in early June, right after the kids get out of school.

I'm hoping one of you can give me some simple advice. 

Here's the deal: I earn a decent amount of Amex Gold reward points (about 500/month). I live near an American hub, but AMEX doesn't transfer directly to AA, so I've been transferring them to BA, because I've read that you can then transfer them to Iberia and then AA (or something like that? -- like  I said, it's confusing to me).

I started doing a bunch of research about ways to book business or first with miles/points but am getting pretty overwhelmed, hoping someone may be able to steer me in the right direction. 

We have points spread across a number of different programs, listed below, broken down by mine (P1) vs hers.

Basically we are looking for: 

* Boston to Tokyo R/T
* Business or First
* approx. 11-15 days total
* Earliest possible date we could leave is ~10/16/2019; we’d consider anytime Nov/Dec, possibly Jan, depending on availability, pricing etc, but preference is late Oct / early-mid Nov
* We would plan to travel around Japan, rather than spending the full 2 weeks in Tokyo. But I assume Tokyo round trip is much more economical than open jaw?

Marriott | 62k | 70k

Can anyone provide some guidance as to what I should be looking for, the best way(s) to search for availability, or any other general tips? Since there aren’t as many direct Boston to Tokyo flights, am I better off searching for award bookings from other cities, e.g. Chicago or LA to Tokyo, to get a better idea of actual cost of the main leg? Also I noticed that a lot of possible Bus/First flights I found were deceptive since the short leg, e.g. BOS-ORD was first but ORD-NRT was Economy. Are there other ways to weed those out? But I wouldn’t mind flying Economy on legs within the US (and am not opposed to 1-stop itineraries)

Or, would you recommend using some sort of award booking service to assist us with all this?

These are some of the best Y seats you can get to cross the pacific in. (Esp. when you think about how CX is switching their 777s to a 3-4-3 nightmare)\n\nThat, plus Japanese service, plus the volume of AA point you have right now is worth the risk to me.

72,Going to be doing a lot of NYC to Washington DC travel and looking to maximize points/gain status,10,abq1lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/abq1lc/going_to_be_doing_a_lot_of_nyc_to_washington_dc/,26,1546433634.0,"I'm going to be going back and forth from NYC to DC relatively frequently (maybe 4-6 flights a month? Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

Any help is appreciated.

In all but the best of cases, Acela will beat waiting for a delayed or new flight from NYC - DC.\n\nHotels: SPG/Marriott is definitely the way to go, especially as long as they hold transferrable points.

Looking to travel to Maldives, Singapore, Japan, Bali, and possibly Sydney. Sometime in September/October 2019 for 3 weeks w/ 2 people. Hotels I have covered through Hilton & SPG credit cards. My paralysis comes from the crazy number of options and combinations for flights (High likelihood I'm overcomplicating it). It seems like I can be leveraging excursionist/stopovers/open jaws, but for some reason they aren't slapping me in the face. Very open to positioning flights to LAX or JFK.

Couple Requirements: SQ Suites at some point, Business Class International, Either beginning or ending in Maldives (too hard to do in the middle of a trip)

Points: 320K+FNCs Hilton (Diamond), 100K Hyatt (Explorist), 500K+ Marriott (Plat), 300K Avios, 300K UR, 150K MR, 200K United (Silver), 120K Jetblue (for domestic)

My Thoughts were something along the lines of 

F1 Positioning: SFO-LAX (if needed)

F2: SFO/LAX-HND-SYD (Stopover in Japan)

F3: SYD-SIN-Bali (Stopover in SIN?)

F4: Bali-SIN-MLE

F4a: Seaplane Transfers (Covered by Amex GCs via Delta)

F5: MLE-SIN

F6 SQ Suites: SIN-FRA-JFK (NYC)

F7 Positioning: (NYC)-SFO


My Questions - 

1. Can I put two open jaws together to form a ""RT"" to get a stopover (I.E. F2 & F7, F1 & F3). Does anyone have advice on the first half of this trip (Is it even realistic to get 2 stopovers?)

2. Can I book SQ Suites from Maldives and combine F6+F7 (MLE-SIN-FRA-JFK). When I searched on Krisflyer, anytime I added MLE in the leg, it forced me into Biz Class search.

3. Can I use Avios anywhere here (minus the fuel surcharges etc.)

4. We are open to pushing the trip back a month or two in case I need to get a couple AA cards, but I'm hoping to find some combination with my current stash

Thanks!","[""Simplify, simplify, simplify. This isn't a mileage run, this is your honeymoon. If you have 3 weeks, pick 3 places to visit, 4 at most.

I can’t imagine this + Sydney, Tokyo, and Bali in another week and a half. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’d do all that travel again to be back in the Maldives, but it was definitely exhausting. ', 'I would drop Sydney totally.  It over-complicates everything.  Go LAX/SFO to NRT/HND (although you only said Japan, not Tokyo).  It is a lot easier to get on flights to KIX versus NRT/HND in my experience.  From Japan head to Bali; Bali to Singapore; then Singapore to Male; that leaves Male back to USA (not sure of those options other than EK/EY/QR).  Alternatively go from Japan to Male; then Male-SIN; SIN-DPS; DPS-back to USA.', 'Couple thoughts here:\n\n* As someone else pointed out, this seems like A LOT of flying for a honeymoon. We love to travel and wanted to go around the world for our honeymoon as well (and we\'re going to), but we simplified it and are still going to do an amazing trip. FWIW, in Feb we\'re going LAX-SIN-USM-BKK-MLE-AUH-LAX. All are non-stop and all are in first or biz. F3 and F4 just seem unnecessary and would cause you more pain than it\'s worth.\n* Addressing #2 of your questions, Gamesst is incorrect in their answer. The reason why you can\'t see first online is because MLE-SIN doesn\'t have first class, but only business. Since all of your legs  in your search aren\'t first it sort of bumps you down to business. You should be able to book that no problem, but you will have to call in to do it, and they will charge you first class redemption charge for all legs. \n* For #3, you can use Avios for flights on Cathay. Most likely will have to do J instead of F, but absolutely look into that.\n* You may want to look into getting some AA miles as well so you can redeem for F on Etihad. Should be plenty of F award availability to/from LAX, and they have flights to MLE as well. \n* Just reiterating what I said before, try and narrow down your list. SYD, FRA and Bali all seem excessive. I get that you want to fly the SQ suites (as did we), but not sure it\'s worth going completely out of the way for. ""Standard"" SQ in F is still better than 99% of anything else you\'ll fly. I would skip SYD since it\'s WAY far out of the way, and focus on SE Asia, MLE and then either going to the UAE or Europe.', 'Can you explain F4a? Seaplane via delta gift card.  Are you referring from MLE to a property in the Maldives? If so which?', ""As others have said, this is WAY too much travel for a honeymoon. 1 destination per week, max.\n\nAlso worth noting that the Maldives are easy to include in any Star Alliance trip that includes a stop-over, generally something like SFO-IST-MLE-SIN will do the trick. ANA or Aeroplan would both cover what you're looking for."", '1) Question isn\'t really clear (what\'s ""F8""?). Krisflyer allows stopovers on one way saver awards (two on anytime awards, FWIW). \n\n2) Krisflyer awards are restrictive with their allowed routings and typically what\'s shown on the site is what\'s permitted by their call centers. \n\n3) Avios only has obnoxious surcharges on their own metal and typically only through the UK. It won\'t be the lowest miles redemption but you can totally do SFO-HND and HND-SYD on JAL  metal with Avios (also nominally SFO-LAX is good with Avios, due to their distance based award chart. Note they\'ve now bumped up all intra-US flights to at least the 7500 tier though).\n\nSince Avios are by far the most annoying of your currencies I would definitely strongly consider using them in that way.\n\n4) You should have enough with your current stash to book this trip for two people.

[you can check out this trip report for details](https://reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/67ajc9/trip_report_3_week_honeymoon_japan_singapore/)\n\nFor SQ you have to call in to do a mixed class itinerary, it will be the first class price. So search availability MLE-SIN seperately in J then the rest of the itinerary in F then call in to book and ask them to waive the fee since you can't book it online."", ""Thanks for the advice - I think you're right that Sydney is the odd duck here, and we could probably do an Australia trip all by itself with SYD/MEL/Brisbane."", ""This is why I come to the experts haha.

As far as travel goes I'm not too particular on any specific airline. I prefer direct flights because I've missed too many transfers and being stuck in lounges is annoying. I also prefer SNA and LGB the most, but if LAX/ONT would help I can make that work too.

I see JetBlue runs LGB to BOS and has TrueBlue with some associated cards, and United runs LAX to BOS with several cards that help accrue MileagePlus miles. Which of these programs would be better?  Are there any other carriers I should be aware of?

I currently have a Chase card (CSP) with a few points. I'm open to joining new cards and mileage programs (haven't opened new credit cards in years now).

Plus, jetBlue's economy product is much nicer than United's. The JetBlue Plus card is currently offering a 40k point bonus after $1k in spend, which is enough for two LGB-BOS round trips. The all-time high offer on this card is 60k miles after $1k spend, but who knows if that will ever return! I'm not sure that the other benefits of the card make it worth keeping beyond the first year (I'd see if Barclays will downgrade it to the no-fee version). Although Mosaic doesn't officially include the chance at complimentary seat upgrades, it does afford you the opportunity to use your earned TrueBlue points to purchase seat upgrades at pretty favorable rates."", ""ONT has no directs to Boston. You will stop at either JFK/SLC/PHX/DEN or DFW for a layover. LAX you can find a direct, but depending on where you live, you will get tired of the traffic in short order.

* I can redeem miles on any airline in an alliance regardless of the airline loyalty program they were accrued in (I know exchange rates, availability, etc. vary)

Couple of other things to note:

* I have to use a company credit card to pay for company travel
* My company prefers Delta and UA domestically (AA is out of policy)
* I have two international trips coming up, one in September to Japan (business class), the other to Scotland in October (likely flying economy w/ BA).

So

* For my upcoming international trips, should I bank miles in BA or AA or someone else?
* For my ongoing domestic business travel, should I accrue on UA and Delta or pick international carriers to apply miles to?
* What other questions should I be asking?

Thanks in advance for your help. Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this, but it sure looks like you guys know your stuff.","['How much flexibility do you have in which airlines you choose? Since you are not flying AA that makes the BA flight to Scotland a bit of a waste in terms of elite status and mileage accrual. If you’re looking at only UA vs DL here is my 2c. \n\nDL is the superior airline in terms of customer service, consistency and quality of planes and crew, better operations and better management. From BOS you’ll connect quite a bit through LGA and occasionally JFK. JFK is a pain in the ass and in my experience more prone to delays. Unfortunately though, their FF program is probably the least valuable in terms of points, their alliance is the worst for flexibility, and they are almost always the program that will find ways to cut costs first (which UA will eventually then copy). \n\nUA is mediocre at customer service and a mixed bag with quality of planes and crew. They still haven’t fully merged the old CO operations in and you can often tell which FAs worked at CO and which are legacy UA. From BOS you’ll do lots of connections through EWR and IAD. EWR is fine, but IAD is a mess. United though has a pretty decent FF program and the best alliance. They have the most options to Europe, decent options to Asia, and much more reliable value for their points.  \n\nThe people I know who fly UA consider it a love/hate relationship, but enjoy the ability to use their miles much easier and to more places than DL. The folks with DL loyalty tend to love DL when flying, but hate that their points are harder to spend and DL constantly slides in devaluations. ', ""So, what's important is firstly understanding how you're going to use these points after accrual. Obviously you'll want to take advantage of a program that's most beneficial to you--which airline has the most flights out of your home airport?\n\nI personally live in the Atlanta area, so Delta is a no-brainer for me.\n\nYou also should try to use airlines that are sister programs with your airline of choice. For me, international flights via KLM all count towards my Delta Skymiles.\n\nI'm sure others will provide a much more in depth and overall better answer, but these are some considerations for you."", 'All three of your assumptions are correct.\n\n>My company prefers Delta and UA domestically (AA is out of policy)\n\nIf your home airport is a hub for one of those I would pick whichever one that is.  If it is a hub for both then I would pick whichever of the two has a hub domestically/internationally for wherever you could see yourself repeatedly going for award travel.\n\n\n\n>For my upcoming international trips, should I bank miles in BA or AA or someone else?\n\nI would use the alliance member of whichever domestic airline you picked (probably Lufthansa or Air France).', ""I'd take a few things into consideration.\n\nThis might sound obvious, but which airline has direct flights to where you work? For example, I used to fly a route route weekly where Southwest was the only direct option. Had I chased after something like United, it would have added several hours to my commute every week. Ultimately you're also going to benefit most from status/loyalty on your bi-weekly flight, so I'd concentrate on making that trip better.\n\nOf course, depending on your airport, you could have a lot more flexibility. I had a coworker that was based out of LA, so he switched from Southwest to American, and still had direct flights available. This was mostly done for upgrades/international awards. I know AA is out of your policy, but it's just an example.\n\nPersonally, I'm a big fan of Southwest for domestic flights. With the amount you're flying right now, you probably have Companion Pass within reach with the help of a credit card. I know some folks prefer assigned seating/upgrades waivers, etc. I guess it comes down to what works best for you.\n\nI'd also keep in mind matching partners for vacation purposes. I believe Alaska gives a status match on Southwest. I'm not sure what your hotel situation is, but Platinum Marriott gets reciprocal United Silver status. I'm not totally sure about JetBlue, but I imagine there is something similar there too.\n\nI suppose if you have options, where do you want to go for award redemptions? Seems your company likes UA, and UA would get you international options. "", ""Your assumptions are correct, but unless you're flying long-haul business class, you're not going to rack up a ton of points flying 10-20 times a year.\n\nI know you say you don't care much about status, but it *can* make a big difference, depending where and when you're flying.\n\nFor example, if you have a lot of connections through Detroit or Chicago in the summer or winter, then having status on Delta or United, respectively, can make a HUGE difference in how quickly you get re-routed when you inevitably get diverted due to weather.\n\nIf you fly often out of a small regional airport, then even mid-level status is likely to result in a lot of free upgrades to business class. As a Delta Gold, flying out of a city of 600,000 people, I get upgraded for free about 90% of the time."", 'The most important piece of information is where you live.', 'Thanks, everybody, for chiming in! I\'m beginning to get a better picture. What I\'m hearing is that I should be considering the long game here. Making a few strategic sacrifices now will pay off in better treatment and a better experience in the long run. \n\nI wanted to fly BA to Scotland because they\'re nice and they offered the best price for a daytime flight. I thought I could string together a BA flight to Edinburgh and a JAL flight and maybe get a free flight on oneworld out of just those. To truly maximize though, I should book those on a DL or UA sister airline so that I can get both status and add to miles on airlines that I fly domestically. \n\nFor my domestic travel, BOS isn\'t really a hub for anything these days. (Everything I read says it\'s a Delta ""focus city"" whatever that means, but they never seem to be a legit option for me.) I travel to DEN, CHI, PHL, MCO most frequently for work, so United is probably my best bet (what do you guys think?) and I should look to book my international trips on a Star Alliance partner as opposed to oneworld to get the most bang for my (employer\'s) buck. Is there a big difference between flying United and BA to EDI? \n\nAlso, doesn\'t status reset at the end of the calendar year? Does that change the math w/r/t my upcoming international trips? \n\nThank you, thank you, thank you for walking me through all this. ', 'Thanks! Your response was extremely helpful in putting the tradeoffs into perspective. ', ""Thanks for taking the time to reply! \n\nFor cashing in, I live in Boston so my airline of choice has been JetBlue because my non-business travel is generally domestic, and I mostly have to connect to get anywhere good anyway. My top priority for using my points is to get one or two free international flights out of it, not so much an ongoing benefit thing. \n\nI'm not going to be pulling in 6-digit elite level miles, but I am going to get a bunch of miles from international travel over two months, then a constant stream thereafter. So my question is, should put these miles towards a domestic loyalty program and then redeem to a sister airline once I've got enough to go somewhere good OR should I bank them in BA or another international carrier that has better exchange rates or whatnot. Or am I going about this all wrong? I'm so confused."", 'He/She already said, Boston', ""> Is there a big difference between flying United and BA to EDI?\n\nNo.\n\n> Also, doesn't status reset at the end of the calendar year? Does that change the math w/r/t my upcoming international trips?\n\nNot exactly. Any status you earn now will carry forward into next year, and then starting January 1, 2019 you'll begin working towards requalifying for the 2020 program year. \n\nFor example, I hit Delta Silver status a couple months ago. I'm Silver now for the rest of this year and all next year regardless of my future flying. I can still potentially earn Gold or higher for next year, but on Jan 1, all my totals will go to zero and I'll have to start working my way towards status again by Dec 31. "", 'I’m gonna go against the grain here and suggest JetBlue. While they aren’t in a global alliance, they’re the only airline that goes direct to all the domestic destinations you listed. Their coach cabin is also very nice.\n\nFor your Scotland flight I’d also consider Aer Lingus thru DUB as they have the least backtracking involved and US preclearence. You may be able to bank JetBlue miles on this as they partner on some routes, but you’ll have to check. ', 'PS, Marriott has some great synergy with UA. high status on one gets you status on the other.  ', 'It totally depends on what you plan on doing with the miles you accrue. Take some time to sit down and get a general idea of your work travel plans for the next year or two, figure out how many miles you\'d earn with each program and what the realistic availability/miles cost/fees are for places you\'d actually want to go with them, then make your decision. Trust me, it\'s best to do the research now and start working towards a goal rather than just crediting miles to somewhere because it seems like the ""best deal"" or because that\'s what others say is the best value but with no real plan in mind.\n\nOtherwise, I\'d bank them in domestic programs. Pick one and stick with it as much as you can. That BA flight to Scotland is not going to help with United or Delta but if you must stick with BA then I\'d say credit it to AA. Any chance you can change it to a United flight through EWR?', ""I'm basically in the same boat for you work wise in the number of trips, but nothing international.  For me I do Southwest for the Companion Pass and use Chase UR points for international vacation travel.  Harder to do if you can't use your own credit cards..."", ""JetBlue has been my go-to for a while now. My company doesn't hate them like AA, and I can usually justify choosing them over UA or DL because of the direct flights as you mentioned. Maybe I should just stick with them when I can. I'm going to do a little research to see if I can get something out of the two international trips coming up, too. I didn't realize that JB partnered with international carriers like you mentioned. Thanks for the tip!"", ""Sage advice for sure. As Yogi said, if you don't know where you're going, you'll end up someplace else. ""]"

I need to travel from LAX (Los Angeles) to JRO (Kilimanjaro airport in northern Tanzania), and from ZNZ (Zanzibar, Tanzania) to LAX. The lowest cash prices I'm finding are around $10,000.

* I can depart ZNZ any time on 1 January, 2019.
* I am only looking to travel using major carriers. KLM and Qatar Airlines are the only two that have flights with just one layover stop.

**Current Stats, Programs and Cards:**

* I have an excellent (over 800) credit score.
* I do not have status on any airline.
* I have an American Express Platinum card with 68,783 Membership Reward Points.
* I have 32,049 JetBlue True Blue points.
* I currently hold the following credit cards: American Express Platinum, American Express Blue Cash, Citi Double Cash, Chase Freedom.

Costa Rica Feb 2018 | Hyatt free night along with some points and 50k Skypesos | My annual free hyatt night was coming to expiration. I really wanted to put it to full use at the Andaz in Costa Rica. Moved some UR over to make it a long weekend trip. Blew a bit more skypesos than I’d like but I really wanted to get away for Prez weekend. The Andaz was a beautiful property. The base forest room was really nice with a shower that opens up to the patio. Delicious mangos and really fun cocktail and ceviche class. Highly recommend people to burn their free night here. Love to come back.

Hong Kong May 2018 | **75k Aeroplan Eva Air, 115k AA Cathay Pacific F** | After two months of no flying, I really wanted to get the hell away for Memorial Day weekend. CX F availability finally opened up from HKG-JFK. I really wanted to try out EVA Air J so this was perfect for 75k Aeroplan. Booked everything on a Monday, flew out on Thursday. Drank so much on Eva, that I didn’t even made my seat lie flat. I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in HK. The location couldn’t be more perfect. Easy to get around. My last night I blew my IHG free night at the Intercontinental HK due to a friend’s recommendation. Gorgeous fuckin lobby but the location was a bit further away and I felt like the rooms were a bit outdated. The bathroom was huge though. The main reason I went to HK, was to fly on CX F. I lounged hop all of CX’s lounges. The Pier and The Wing was best. Love the Cabanas tub/shower. The food was great. And wow the CX F seat was wide as fuck. Sleeping in it was so comfy too. Much more comfier than SQ Suites. I do think the tv monitor could use an update.
Cancun June 2018 | 2 free hyatt night, 25k hyatt | My bro had his hyatt night’s expiration coming and so I moved my points over to make it 3 nights. Took him to Hyatt Ziva Cancun. I honestly really like this property better than Zilara. All the kids there don’t really bother. So much more food options. I think I gained an extra 10 lbs with all the food I ate. Would come back here instead of Zilara. Blew some Delta gc and Jetblue points to get/leave CUN.
Chicago June 2018 | 6k Jetblue, free Hyatt Stay | This was an extremely spur of the moment trip for me. One of chefs I follow, Wagyumafia was having a pop up in Chicago. I flew out on a Saturday morning to Chicago, dined with him at 1am, flew out the next morning. Stayed at the Hyatt The Loop. Got a corner room, huge ass room. Def recommend this hotel. Forgot how much points I paid for this.
Jordan and Egypt July 2018 | 25k Merrill, BA Avois, Cash flight | Went on this trip with some churning friends. Found a great cash deal from CAI-JFK on Air Italty’s converted old Qatar planes for $500. Booked using my Merrill(I love you). I knew if I wanted to do Egypt, I needed to do Petra, Jordan as well. Got a cash flight to Jordan. We spent a couple days in Jordan and did Petra, Wadi Rum and Crown Plaza Dead Sea. Highly recommended it. Spent a night in Sun City Camp in their Martian Bubble Tent. The stars were beautiful. Dead Sea was nice and holy shit did it burned all our eyes. We used Avois to get to AMM-CAI, forgot how much. Egypt isn’t my favorite place but seeing the Pyramids in person was nice. Air Italy’s J seat wasn’t bad at all but not really to write about.
San Diego July 2018 | Delta Companion Cert | My yearly trek to SDCC. Used my delta companion cert with a friend. Tamed SDCC year due to no Marvel Studios or GoT. 
Buenos Aires August 2018 | **48k Skypesos**, 20k Park Hyatt | I didn’t get a chance to make it to South America last year in my travels so I had to make up for it. Months ago, Delta had a flash sale for South America. I could not resist. Nice getaway from the humid NYC Weather but man I did not expect it to be that cold in BA. Stayed at the Milhouse Hostel, a great party hostel, shitty beds. All my dorm mates were making fun of me cause I went out to eat steak almost every night. My last night, I booked Park Hyatt Buenos Aires because I could not turn down a chance to stay at a Palace. The PH BA has two buildings, the palace and the tower. Roomed at the tower with a corner view of the Palace. They offered me a room with twin beds and asked they can make it a king bed, wtf? What they really did was just push the two beds together which ended up even better because it was wide as fuck. Ended missing my flight out due to traffic but luckily I had enough avois in my account to book on AA the next night out. Burned 30k IHG for a night stay at the Intercontinental. Room felt outdated but whatever, I needed a room for the night and it was free. Went back to the hostel party and club afterwards and flew out the next night.



- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends. Except for Buenos Aires, spend 10 days there a bit long for me.
- 6 trips in the last 4 months was fun. 
- How much points do I have left? Idk, I know its over a million across the board but under 2 million. Still got 400k UR, 340k AA, 300k MR off the top of my head.



The next trip I have booked is St. Regis Maldives again in Feb 2018. Managed to catch the 340k marriott during the merge. Was hoping to go this year since I’m Plat due to the Ritz for free breakfast but Feb will give me a longer time to save money. How to get there? Idk yet.

Trying to do my first award booking here! Hoping to fly one-way from NYC to Brisbane on UR points. I've found a couple options, mentioned below, one of which is decently good, but I still feel like maybe I'm missing something. Can anybody chime in if I've overlooked something obvious?

Thanks in advance!

**How many people will be travelling with you?** Just me alone


**What have you found so far?**

*Option 1:* Transfer UR to KLM, end up on China Southern Airlines business class:

    CZ300	NYC to Guangzhou, Departs: Tue 23 Oct 
    CZ381	Guangzou to Brisbane	
    Cost: 144,000 points + 114 Euro

    CA 820 Newark to Beijing		First class	
    SQ 807 Beijing to Singapore		Economy	
    SQ 255 Singapore to Brisbane		Economy	
    Cost: 130k miles, note the dreaded ""mixed cabin""

*Option 3:* Transfer UR to TrueBlue, end up on Hawaiian airlines

    Cost unclear, requires phone calls
    Possibly economy only
    But could try to upgrade with more points?

*Option 4:* Try to transfer UR to Marriot and then SPG, to get more options?

103,First time redemption booked! Looking to learn for future redemptions.,9,8lm9ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/8lm9ia/first_time_redemption_booked_looking_to_learn_for/,15,1527133199.0,"Post-booking critiques welcome:

Right about at my 1 year churniversary I've finally made my first long-haul premium bookings with SO on points.

Leg 1: JFK -> IST 
LH/ J (~1 hr layover FRA to GVA, then GVA to IST (on TK)). 
The FRA-> IST direct TK leg wasn't available so I had to call UA to manually book as FRA->GVA->IST. 
Booked via united for 70k each + ~63$ tax. 

Hotel: Doubletree Istanbul - Sirkeci for 4 nights, paying cash (its ~$100/night). It's a short trip in IST so I picked this over the other istanbul hotels primarily because of location.

Leg 2: IST to ASR (cappadocia) 
TK Y (1 hr flight) booked via united for 8k each + ~6$ tax.

Hotel: Osmanbey Cave Hotel. It was about $90/night x2 nights so I paid cash. There weren't really any deals via CSR 1.5x on hotels that were in the area we wanted to be in.
Booked Hot air balloon ride via CSR 1.5x though for 24k UR.

Leg 3: ASR to MLE (via IST) 
TK J 
Booked via united 55k each + ~33$ tax. 

Hotel: Conrad Rangali, booked 95k/night x3 nights + 1 weekend cert. 
I have diamond status which ohopefully well help with upgrades. I have 2 nights beach villa 2 nights overwater villa, but I haven't quite decided exactly what I should finalize them as.
I would have done 5 nights on points to get 5th night free, but due to PTO I didn't want to sacrifice more time.

Just signed up for spark biz 1k that I plan on using for the sea plane $$$. 

Leg 4: MLE to IAD via DOH. 
QR in J. 
The DOH-IAD leg is in Qsuites which I think will be nice with SO.
I think QR provides a free hotel since the DOH layover is >8 hours. I need to confirm this. 
Booked via 70k AA miles each, + ~$70 tax which I will use part of my biz plat AA incidental reimbursement to cover, then use CSR to cover the rest for trip delay etc.

Since home airport is JFK, I'll be booking an IAD to JFK on jetblue for about 5k points each. 

Total costs:

MILES
266k UA (mostly transferred from UR)
140k AA
11k Jetblue

POINTS
285k Hilton + weekend cert from Ascend spend

$600 on the cash hotels.
$1100~ for seaplane
$1200-1500 Anticipated on the food in rangali (we don't drink so no need to worry about those costs) 

Only relevant cards included... I have spend and built miles via freedom and other MS too so the bonuses may not exactly have been the direct result of the booking:
CSR 100k
CIP #1 100k
CIP #2 100k
UA 40k

Amex HH Ascend
100k bonus + 200k MS'd

AA Plat biz 70k
AA Plat pers 70k
Jetblue Personal 40k
Spark $1000 bonus

This trip is for next month and I did all the booking over the past week, so availability was tough, otherwise aeroplan via TK probably would have been a good option to save a bunch of UR/UA miles. I could have done aeroplan anyway and paid taxes but it was basically the equivalent in taxes as it was for miles and I can build UR very easily via MS etc so I made the decision to burn them.

I would love to hear the experts' thoughts on the bookings so that I can learn!","[""QR does NOT provide free hotel for award tickets, only for revenue tickets. The business lounge in DOH is very nice and has some semi\\-comfortable, semi\\-private cot things that you can sleep on. When you enter the lounge, turn right and the sleeper area is back behind the lockers. Bring earplugs as it's very loud.  Depending what time your layover is, Qatar offers free tours of Doha several times per day. They have a booth in the airport where you can sign up when you land."", ""That's an impressive redemption, congrats! Make sure to report back on how everything was!"", ""Great redemption, and high degree of difficulty for a first redemption.

Also, really good redemption on QR using the AA miles.', 'If you did not get your QR PNR at time of booking via AA send them a DM on twitter and they will provide it.\n\nQR is well known for switching aircraft products.

They have been very inconsistent on who they allow to select the seats ahead of time.\n\nDoha, there is a Marriott that is less than a $10 Uber to and from the airport that is 10k points and pretty solid (if you are flying J getting to the airport 1.5h before your flight leaves is fine). Taking an Uber to the Islamic Art Museum/Souq is less than $5.', 'You would probably be able to get away with spending less on food.  My wife did 5 dinners and drinks every afternoon after snorkeling and only spent $700 total.', ""looks like a pretty good plan! i can't wait to hear back because i'm looking to do something similar!"", ""That's an excellent redemption!

There's also another station nearby, so you can easily explore other parts of the city.\n\nThere's also a terrific and cheap kebap place (Shezade Cag Kebap) and dessert cafe (Hafiz Mustafa for Turkish delights and baklava) just 1/2 a mile away. \n\nStop by theTK arrival lounge and explore the departure lounge if you can.

The $250 in hotel credits is like cash to you if you're staying at the Conrad, so it's a $200 AF for a weekend night certificate, $500 in air credits, and 100,000 points.\n\nI'd be willing to bet something about the card gets nerfed in the next couple years (air credit, I'd bet), so getting it now is a decent wager.\n\nIf you want diamond status in the future and you don't hold the card past a year it could potentially be a break-even situation to apply for it even without the signup bonus depending on how exactly the credits get clipped or if they do.

We were still building up my girlfriend's points, so weren't able to book until now. I know it's very short notice. I'm a little panicky myself!

We each have 140k UR points.

I was hoping for F/J on ANA using UR to Virgin Atlantic deal, but there's no availability that I could find. Nothing shows up for LAX \(not sure if I'm doing it wrong\), and everything for JFK is waitlisted.

It's 150k pts \+ fees for mixed j/econ class flights elsewhere on United's site. 80k \+ $50 for economy.

I've found cash economy tickets for $700 though, so it doesn't make sense to use 80k pts. I'd love to have business class, at least one way, but cannot find anything. I'm not sure if I'm just missing something huge or what, but I'd love some help.

106,Trip Report: 14 trips in 14 months,29,7tn6se,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7tn6se/trip_report_14_trips_in_14_months/,20,1517203088.0,"**Trip Report**: [14 trips in the last 14 months](https://i.imgur.com/IWwCqkq.gif)X-Post from r/churning

tl;dr: I finally started burning through my points last Jan 2016. On my second trip in Feb 2016, I was drunk at the hostel bar and challenged myself to do 12 trips in 12 months. It just so happened to be 14 trips because I took a trip in Dec 2015 and Jan 2016.

Detailed Trips or as best as I can remember it.

| Location/Date | Cash/Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
Tokyo Dec 2016 | **60k Skypesos** on Delta Y, JFK-MSP-HND | Delta had a flash sale promoting their MSP - HND route. JFK happened to be on that promotion, JFK - MSP - HND. I wanted to go back to Tokyo for sometime now and figured a long weekend in Tokyo would be fun. I stayed at a capsule hostel, partied and ate my weekend away. Hoping to do this again sometime this year.
Singapore, Maldives, Tokyo Jan 2017 | **93.k SQ miles** on SQ Suites JFK-FRA-SIN, One way cash flight to MLE on tigerair, **75k Hyatt** for Park Hyatt Maldives, **15k Avois** MLE-CMB-SIN, **40k UA miles** on ANA F SIN-NRT, **80k AA miles** on JAL F | So this was my biggest goal and redemption. So this was my biggest goal and redemption. For years I’ve read about SQ Suites and my #1 goal in churning was this and I got it. Stayed in a hostel again in Singapore and man was it humid. I figured since I was in Signapore and the Maldives was so close, why not try and go for it. Park Hyatt didn’t have free nights available for my certificates but it was available for 25k per night. Booked 3 nights and paid for a cheap tigerair fight out. In hindsight, the tigerair was late at night, didnt get to PH until 1am. That was a waste. I’ve never been to a resort before and this was beautiful. Oh yea, used my Arrival miles to pay for the transfer fee. For this trip, I wanted to fly out of Tokyo either on JAL or ANA. I flew back to SIN using avois on SriLankan Y. I found a cheap 40k UA miles one way on ANA F. Hell yea I’m taking it and to my surprised it on the BB-8 plane. Spent another weekend in Tokyo, ate and drank away. JAL opened up and I took it home from NRT-JFK for 80k AA miles. I flew around the planet in 11 days.
Rome Feb 2017 | **60k Skypesos** on Altalia Y | I was itching to go away again and went to Rome for a long Prez weekend. Stayed at the Yellow Hostel, which I recommend to everyone. Toured, ate and drank away. I’m not religious by any means but man the Vactican was impressive. I’d love to visit again. During this weekend, I was drunk at the hostel bar and figured to myself why not try and do 12 trips in 12 months for 2017. 
Cancun Mar 2017 | **6k Jetblue** one way JFK-CUN, Cash flight Delta with gc CUN-JFK, **2 night free Hyatt Cert** at Hyatt Zilara | Used my 2 Hyatt free night at Hyatt Zilara Cancun. Beautiful property, great good. My friend and I ate our way through this weekend. Sushi was trash.
Puerto Rico April 2017 | **25k Merrill points** | This weekend happened to have a big storm in NYC. My flight delayed for 2 days. Tested out the trip delay insurance and hey they approved it even tho JFK was my home airport. Spent 2 days in Puerto Rico. Wish I had more time to explore.
Iceland May 2017 | Cash flight | Went to Iceland for a long Memorial day weekend. Stayed a hostel again. Man Iceland is f’king expensive. I could not be the foodie like I wanted to because it was so expensive. Went on a tour that took us to a natural hot spring, that was cool. Didn’t do blue lagoon. Made a hostel friend and tagged along his ride for the day. Love to go back when I have some extra extra money. The daylight at 2am was insane. Definitely messed with my head
Havana June 2017 | **SW CP to Havana** | Made a churning friend and we went to Havana. Humid af, didn’t understand all the hype about it. Would not go back.
Tijuana July 2017 | Walked over to Tijuana | Ok, this one I cheated a bit. I was in town in San Diego for Comic Con and to make sure I was out of the country, I walked over the border to Tijuana, ate some tacos and walked back over.
Thailand August 2017 | **120k UA miles** on Asiana F going, **80k ANA J** back. | So this was booked over Thanksgiving 2016. My friend’s biggest goal was going to Thailand and we were researching ways to get there. He wanted to fly any J class and we found 80k Asiana J one way. Impulsively we booked it roundtrip. Over the course of 2017, I moved over another 40k from UR to UA and upgraded myself to Asiana F. The look on my friend’s face when he realized I was flying F day of, was priceless. Of course I invited him down to my suite and we drank some whisky. We paid cash for our hotel stays in Thailand. Have to say, the Hilton gold came in handy for breakfast. Went to Bangkok, Chang Mai, Phi Phi Islands and Phuket. Love to go back and explore more of the islands. I hope that russian milf is doing well.
Bahamas September 2017 | **25k Skypesos** on Delta Y, **40k Hyatt** at Grand Hyatt Baha Mar | Delta had a flash sale to the Carribean for 25k and I moved over 40k UR and stayed at the new Grand Hyatt Baha Mar. Also used a club room cert to get access to the club lounge. I love free food. Another beautiful property and nice pools. Though wasn’t worth 40k points for the weekend.
Oslo & Bergen October 2017 | Cash flight on Norweign JFK-OSL and SAS BGO-OSL, **25k Merrill** points on TAP Portugal J OSL-LIS-JFK | Went on a trip with new churning friends. One of them found the cheap J fare from OSL-LIS-JFK on TAP Portugal, now we just have to made our way to OSL. We blew $300 each at Maaemo, a 3 michelin star restaurant. That was delicious. Drove our way up to Bergen from OSL, great views along the way. Took a flight back to OSL from BGO and flew back on TAP Portugal J. TAP was ok, nothing really to be excited about.
Singapore & Maldives November 2017 | **120k SQ miles** on SQ Suites, JFK-FRA-SIN. Cash at Marina Bay Sands. **15k Avois** SIN-CMB-MLE. **205.5k SPG** points at St. Regis Maldives. $100 flight MLE-DXB-JFK on Emirates | Sometime during 2017, Emirates had a mistake fare for MLE-JFK. Friend and I took advantage of that. He was jealous I went to the Maldives and the one way I’m going back is if I can get the St. Regis. Good thing for still living at home, I took advantage of my family(with their consent) a built up a stash of SPG points. Booked 3 nights overwater villa at 58.5k a night over Thanksgiving. No more availability for extra nights but cash and points were available for a garden villa for $300/15k points a night. Spent 5 days in the Maldives but shitty weather. Backtracking a bit, since I was transitting through Singapore, I wanted to try a fly SQ suites again. I didn’t get off the waitlist until 5 days before. I was adamant to take advantage of everything on the flight but I ended up sleeping through most of it. Met up with my friend in Singapore and we spent a night at Marina Bay Sands. Pool was beautiful but shitty weather.
Brussels & Paris December 2017/NYE | **60k Skypesos** JFK-BRU RT | This was my last trip for the year and I wanted to do NYE in another city. Figured lets go to Europe. Found a 60k flight RT, JFK-BRU. I didn’t want to spend all my time in BRU and so I went down to Paris for NYE. Stayed at a hostel, made some friends and partied into NYE. Went back to Brussels for a night and flew out.
Jamaica Jan 2018 | **15k Jetblue miles**, JFK-MBJ. Cash flight back. **2 Free night at Hyatt** Zilara Rosehall | This time my friend comes through. He got 2 free hyatt nights as well and wanted to go to another Zilara so we can pig out. I moved over enough points to cover one night so we’d get 3 nights. Got upgraded to a large Butler Suite. Property overall was not impressive. The jerk chicken and french restaurant was nice but thats about it. The pools were cold af. Would not come back here.


Overall, 2017 was my best year living life. Even though I traveled for mostly freeish, my bank account hurts. 

**Notes**

- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends, usually Thur-Tues. I also transferred over a decent amount of vacation days in Jan 2017 which helped out alot.

- Still living at home, which helps my bank account and I run through all our bills through my cards.

- Player 2 and half of 3 with family members, which helped me alot

- Still have 500k UR, 170K AA, 130k Skypesos, 100k SPG, 170k MR and others

120,Hawaii Trip,1,7ihst6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7ihst6/hawaii_trip/,25,1512794311.0,"I know there are a lot of posts about Hawaii...so here’s another one!

My fiancé and I are getting married in April 2018. We're planning a delayed honeymoon - probably August - October timeframe. Our leading candidate for destination is Hawaii. I've spent the past few days researching all the different ways to get there with points. I have the following points: 260k UR, 130k MR, 40k United, 120k SW, 70k JetBlue, 140k Hilton, 130k Marriott, 80k SPG.

I realize that the cheapest way to get there with points is probably transferring to Korean Air. However, I think I want to book the tickets before we're actually married and I know they have restrictions on that. I know there are a few other cheap options (Air France, British Airways, etc.) but I would really like to fly at least one way in first class. It seems like the best first class going to Hawaii is on Hawaiian Airlines. If we're not flying first class, I would at least like a plane with 2-X-2 seating. I believe that leaves either a 767 or A330. All of Hawaiian's flights appear to be on an A330 with 2-4-2 seating. The only reasonable option I see for a 767 is Delta metal booked through Air France but the availability is a pretty iffy. Also, I'm thinking of using the UR points on hotels. It doesn't seem like MR points transfer as well to hotels.

This is the itinerary I came up with and points/cost for each leg.

* TPA > JFK on JetBlue (Coach for 7.3k or $119 per Person)

* JFK > HNL on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First 80k MR Points per Person)

* HNL > OGG on Hawaiian ($73 per Person - I will try to see if I can get the Amex Plat Reimbursement on these.)

* OGG > SFO on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First $567.33 per Person)

* SFO > FLL on JetBlue (Mint for 33.7k or $449 per Person)

* FLL > TPA on Southwest (8k or $134 per Person)


Total:

* 73.8k JetBlue (for 2 People w/10% Credit from JetBlue Plus Card) ~1.84 cents/point

* 160k MR Points (for 2 People) ~2.09 cents/point

* 16k SW Points ~1.67 cents/point

* $1,280.66 (for 2 People)

121,Award Ticket Basics Part I - Non-Airline Miles Redemptions,52,5t5l93,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5t5l93/award_ticket_basics_part_i_nonairline_miles/,35,1486734438.0,"##Award Ticket Basics  Part I - Non-Airline Miles Redemptions

Feb 8th, 2017

As more and more people get into churning, more and more folks find their way to r/awardtravel, and basic award redemption questions are popping up daily.  While we have some great guides on the sidebar, It looks like we are missing some pointers on award tickets.  This article will discuss some of the basic concepts in award travel.

###What is an Award Ticket?

The concept is pretty simple here:  Award Ticket is a airline ticket that you get by redeeming Airline Miles, Airline Points, Bank Miles, or Bank points.  The ticket usually is paid for entirely via your points/miles, but you may have to pay for taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges separately.  Notice that I listed multiple currencies that can be used for award tickets, and this is where much confusion and complexity comes into the picture.

###List of Different Award Tickets Types

I’m going to start by listing different But common award ticket types.  I’m trying to be complete, but I’m sure I’m going to miss some.  Feel free to leave me a note to add to this.

- Using Chase Ultimate Rewards Point in Chase Portal
- Using Citi Thankyou Points in Citi Portal
- Using AmEx Membership Rewards Points in AmEx Portal
- Using Barclays Rewards Points 
- Using Capital One Venture Reward Miles
- Using Southwest Airline Rapid Rewards Points
- Using JetBlue TrueBlue points
- Using Airline Miles to redeem Saver Awards
- Using Airline Miles to redeem Anytime Awards
- Using Airline Miles to redeem for Saver Awards on Partner Airlines

In Part I, I’m going to cover all the non-airline Miles redemptions.  In part II, I will be covering Airline Miles redemptions, award charts, alliance partners, etc.

### Using UR/MR/TY Points in a Portal

This is probably the most simple award ticket type.  When you are booking a ticket through a bank portal, you are effectively redeeming your points at a fixed value, and buying the desired ticket.  For example, if you have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card, then redeeming for a ticket at the UR portal will give you an exchange rate of 1.5 cents per point.  This means that if you find a flight listed for $300, you will need to spend 20,000 UR points for that ticket.

#### Pros:

- You are not dependent on airlines making award seats available on the desired flight.  Since you are effectively buying a ticket, as long as there is a seat left on the flight, you can redeem for that seat.
- Since you are effectively purchasing the seat, if the fare class earns miles, you will earn miles after you complete the flight.
- You are basically booking through a travel agent, so you don’t have to study award charts or other complications.
- The redemption cost typically is all inclusive.  Fees and taxes will just be paid for via points as well.

#### Cons:

- Some fare class earn little or no miles.  If you redeemed for the lowest cost ticket, you probably shouldn’t count on earning lots of miles for the flight.
- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your redemption cost just went up as well.
- Bank Portals don’t always have the lowest price tickets. A common complaint is that people can find a cheap flight elsewhere, but unable to match that price in the Portal.
- The high prices for premium class tickets means those redemptions are often out of reach.  A $7,500 First Class ticket would cost 500,000 UR points, and very few people can accumulate that many points via churning. 

#### When should you redeem through a Portal

- When the airfare is low.  If there is a $600 RT ticket to Asia, that will only cost you 40,000 UR points, and that is lower than every other redemption choices.
- When you MUST fly on a certain flight.  If the flight you need do not have other award seats, you are left with buying the ticket.  It becomes a choice on whether you will pay cash to save your points, or pay with your points to save the cash.
- When you can’t find a better deal by transferring your points to a particular airline.  If your goal is to travel in premium class, your best bet is to save these points to transfer to an airline program.

### Using Barclay/Capital One Miles/Points

You’ve seen the commercials, how Capital One miles can be used on any airline anytime.  Well, that is because while Barclay and Capital One call them “Miles”, they are basically Points that are worth 1 cent each when redeeming for travel.

For both of these banks, the points are very easy to use, and they have the added bonus they can be used to redeem for any expense coded as Travel.   For example, I have redeemed Barclay Award Miles for the cost of a bus tour, as well as tickets for a train ride.  To begin the redemption process, just purchase your travel/airline ticket either through a website or a travel agent, and pay using your Barclay/Capital One card.  In a few days, the charge will show up online in your credit card account, and you can redeem your Award points against the travel charges as statement credit.  So if you bought a $200 airline ticket on your Capital One Venture card, you can select that $200 charge, and “erase” that charge by redeeming 20,000 Venture Miles.

#### Pros:

- You are not dependent on airlines making award seats available on the desired flight.  You can find the cheapest ticket that works for you, and just buy it.
- You are purchasing the ticket, and if the fare class earns miles, you will earn miles after you complete the flight.
- You don’t have to study award charts or other complications.
- You can usually pay for Fees and taxes as well if they are part of the same charge.
- You can redeem for other travel charges, such as train tickets, rental cars, etc
- You can pay for a ticket to help with meeting minimum spend on a card, then use the point you earn to get statement credit for the same ticket.  This is one of few cases you can use your bonus before you actually earn them.

#### Cons:

- Some fare class earn little or no miles.  If you bought the lowest cost ticket, you probably shouldn’t count on earning lots of miles for the flight.
- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your points don’t go as far.
- There are restrictions on redemptions.  For example, Barclays Arrival Plus card requires the charge to be at least $100 before you can redeem miles against it.  That means if you have only 9,900 Miles, you can’t redeem the points at all.  The Arrival card has a lower limit of $25.
- The high prices for premium class tickets means those redemptions are often out of reach.  A $7,500 First Class ticket would cost 750,000 Venture Miles, and very few people can accumulate that many Miles. 

#### When should you use Barclay/Capital One Miles

- When there are no other points that can be used.  For example, you can use Barclay Arrival+ to pay for a train ticket, and later redeem the points to reduce the cost.  You can’t do that with other points/Miles.
- When you find a great price on a ticket, but the price is not available through a bank portal.

### Using Southwest/JetBlue points

Southwest and JetBlue points are sometime referred to as “fixed value” redemptions, even though they actually aren’t fixed.  In both cases, the amount of points needed to redeem for an award ticket is directly proportional to the price of the ticket being sold at that time, but the exchange rate is modified by the airline for various reasons that they don’t publish.  Typically, both Southwest and JetBlue points are valued between 1.4-1.7 cents per points.  To be clear, I have bundled these two points program together in this discussion since they are similar, but Southwest points can only be used to fly on Southwest, and JetBlue points can only be used to fly on JetBlue.  JetBlue points can also be used to redeem for flights with Hawaiian airlines also in a fixed value fashion.

To redeem these points, just goto the respective website, and search for the flight you want, with the option set to Use Points.  The airline website will tell you how many points it will cost, and as long as a seat is available and you have the points, you can redeem for it.  

#### Pros:

- As long as a seat is available, you can redeem points for it.
- The valuation is typically in a tight range, so you know how much your point is worth.
- You don’t have to study award charts or other complications.

#### Cons:

- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your points don’t go as far.
- Since the valuation is fixed, you probably won’t find any outsized redemption options.
- Ticket paid for by points will not earn additional points.

#### When should you use Southwest or JetBlue points?

- When you are flying Southwest or JetBlue, and you have enough points to redeem.  There is very little reason to hold these unless you have bigger plans for those points, such as a possible future JetBue Mint redemption.

I have to make a payment of about $8400 on December 1st via PayPal to cover point rental: here is what I was contemplating.

I will be under 5/24 in September... Open Ink Preferred and CSR. Put $5,000 onto Ink via Paypal - 80,000 pts Put remainder on CSR via Paypal and charge whatever else to meet $4000 minimum spend - 50,000 pts

We will need to cover about $1500 in airfare via JetBlue plus $500 or so in upgrades to leg room - do you think the 138,000 UR pts will cover this if I book via the Chase travel portal with the pts? JetBlue is the only airline we'll consider flying for this trip. ALSO, do we get 1.5x back on all 138,000 or so pts even though they all weren't earned via the CSR?

What have you found so far?
awardhacker has flights on american airlines in economy for 35k rountrip and business for 55k roundtrip. The route should be JFK - SJU - EIS. Anyone with experience booking this route?

It looks like AA does not have direct flights to SJU from JFK when searching individual segments on the AA website. I have thought about doing a jetblue award flight (obtaining 3k jetblue miles is not a problem) for 2 people from JFK to SJU for 52,000 JBLU points (around 1.56 cpp). Then calling in to book AA partner flight on seaborne from SJU to EIS for 2 people roundtrip for a total of 30,000 AA miles, would like to use up my AA miles.

Jetblue Flight 1804 7:21PM departure from SJU, arrive at 10:27PM at JFK

How troublesome is it transferring between two airlines on one trip? Any concerns with the timing of the connecting flights?

I have seen commonly that people will fly into St thomas and it is a PITA to travel from there to EIS where the scrub island ferry will pick you up. I am trying to minimize the transfers reasonably.

Any tips on 7 nights in BVI would also be appreciated. Counting on ""breakfast amenity"" since program merger will go through of SPG and Marriott and I have platinum status.

Also, if anyone has any insight on what is the best way to book a flight from LAX to JFK, depart December 14, 2018, returning December 23, 2018 with the least amount of points, it would be appreciated. I am seeing some availability on the 14th for 12.5k points through airfrance, but remember reading some time ago air france will freeze accounts with no other activity on them. The problem I'm seeing is availability going back to LAX.

133,Award Tickets 101: How To Find The Best Redemption,129,4aymw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4aymw5/award_tickets_101_how_to_find_the_best_redemption/,40,1458341776.0,"One of the questions that seems to come up a lot lately on this sub is “how do I find the best redemption to X destination on my points/miles?” Since we have been getting the question almost daily, I decided to put together a 101 type of post on one of the processes for finding the best/least expensive redemption. You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your URs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your TYPs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

Airline | Alliance | Total Mileage Balance
:--------:|:--------:|:---------: 
Delta | SkyTeam | 109,000 Miles
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 110,000 Miles
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 65,000 Miles
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
American Airlines	 | OneWorld | 54,000 Miles
British Airways | OneWorld | 109,000 Miles
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 44,000 Miles
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 110,000 Miles
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qantas | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 175,000 Miles
United Airlines | Star Alliance | 99,000 Miles
EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for “yyy Award Chart” (with ‘yyy’ being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you’re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this – Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control – regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA’s award chart – not LAN’s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

Like I said, it makes more sense than the process I've been using.\n\nThank you!"", ""I'd be interested in seeing this!"", ""And the list of those would take forever to learn.  Want to fly on Philippine Airlines?  Use ANA miles.  How about Ukrainian Air?  Use Flying Blue miles.  Stuff like that.  It's hard enough just trying to keep track of Alaska's partners."", ""First off, welcome to the sub! Nothing wrong with asking questions and it's good that you're looking at both the earning and redemption side early in the process. \n\nYou generally cannot transfer miles between airlines (and in the extremely limited situations where it is possible, you take such a hit on the transfers that it's not worth it). The significance of the alliance column is that alliance members can almost always book award flights amongst themselves. For example, if you have United miles, you can use those miles to book award flights on Lufthansa, ANA, Thai Airways, etc. You'll pay the award price of the booking airline, not the operating airline, so it's important to keep that in mind. For example, if you booked Lufthansa flights with United miles, you'd pay according to the United award chart. Each airline has their own award chart so just because you can book the same flights using United miles that you could book using ANA miles, doesn't mean that the award price is the same. \n\nThere's definitely a lot to learn in the redemption world and I'd recommend you read up as much as possible. The wiki and sidebar/booking guides are great resources to start with. Happy travels!""]"

I'm looking to fly on a specific day (oct 6) from SFO to NYC.
Looking to fly in a lie flat preferably a red-eye/ evening flight.

I have 120kSPG, 600k UR, 200k MR.

So far I saw the jetblue mint for 37k UR via the CSR portal.
I also saw an AA flight for 25k in F to EWR also. 
I haven't flown transcon on any airlines and usually fly econ domestically but last time I flew to California i was exhausted after the flight. 

Any thoughts/suggestions? Any airline better than another for transcon? I was a bit unsure, but could I book that AA flight via BA using UR?

Thanks for all the help!","[""Aa to ewr will include a stop and be in a regular domestic first recliner seat. They don't fly sfo-ewr directly.\n\nB6 mint is probably your best bet.

My home airport is JFK/EWR - I'm assuming I have to connect to get to either of these places, but I'm wondering which airline to try and get a business class ticket for through points.

Obviously these are measly point balances right now, but I hope to fatten them up before I book the tickets.

MR - 55,000
UR - 60,000
JetBlue - 57,000 (dunno if this helps, but I know they have some sort of partnership with Emirates & Singapore Airlines).

I would also like to try a carrier I have not flown international business class with. I've flown JAL business before - whilst it was the best flight I've been on (so far), I would like to try out another product.

So which carrier should I be dumping points into? (At the moment, I only have miles accounts with British Airways (oneworld), Flying Blue (SkyTeam), and Singapore Airlines (Star Alliance) - but creating an account with another MR/UR partner is no problem).

I don't mind using USD to pay for flights between Asian countries, but if there are good redemptions, I would love to use that. 

If there is a super cheap redemption to an Asian country, I don't mind checking that country out either. I'm very flexible and just open to new cultures/countries.

Could use some help or advice with booking a flight.

Passenger is my mother. She flies once a year from SFO to TPE so she's okay with economy due to the frequency, but if there's a good redemption and/or value for business/first, I would prefer to book that for her.

154,Overview of Getting to Europe Using Amex MRs,34,49tbmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/,22,1457643658.0,"I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I'm going to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex’s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The “high season” is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 “high season” will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The “low season” is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “low season” and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the “high season”. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “low season” and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the “high season”.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe – especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions – Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore’s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic’s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al’s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al’s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (“WS”) is January 1 – March 24 and November 1 – December 31, while the Summer Season (“SS”) is March 25 – October 31.  El Al’s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan – from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!","['Oh this is Very Nice!

Looking for help on my first award redemption, flights only. I have been accruing in anticipation of a late May 2018 honeymoon. We’re open to destinations if anyone wants to suggest anything. Departure airport would ideally be JFK but we could also do EWR/LGA. We’re really looking for 3-4 days to sit on a beach, 7-8 days of travel to a new country, back to LAX for a family event 1-2 days and then returning to NYC.  I am still in single-player mode but hoping this trip will awaken the fiancé to what churning can do. We're looking for economy the whole way to maximize the points. 


Here’s what we’re working with:


160k UR


89k JetBlue


67k Southwest



Based on my searches in UltimateRewards portal I know we're tight on the UR balance, but I'm thinking its better to book this early and pay a minimal cash fee rather than waiting closer to the dates.

She's a bit flexible with her dates so that's a plus. Her friend is also having a wedding during this period so she needs to be down there for 6 nights and have time to get to the rehearsal dinner and wedding between Thursday Nov 2nd, 2017 - Saturday Nov 4th, 2017. So as long as she there's for those dates the arrival and depature dates can flex a bit as long as it doesn't go over 6 nights.

I'm currently working with these points:

UR - 16k
MR - 31k
AA - 206k
Barclycard Arrival Plus- 57k 

I've tried pricing this out on Jetblue or SW (was thinking about picking up their card and using my arrival plus points for the other ticket) but the prices are the same. 

Unfortunately it looks like all the saver award space has been taken so flying out of Richmond with 1 stop on AA and back looks like it's going to cost me 55k + $110 in fees (I also have $200 in AA giftcards so that should take care of fees)... so 2x that'll be 110k + $220.. 

It looks like if she flies back Nov 8th or 9th the return tickets could only be 12.5k each, but unfortunately that'll mean she'll have to fly out the day of the rehearsal dinner and if something were to happen she'd miss it. I feel like 55k is a lot for one RT is pretty high... is this as good as it gets or am I (probably) missing something? ","[""Southwest has not released their schedule for those dates yet.

The availability for my Hyatt Zilara Montego Bay trip is junk all-around.  Trip is booked for April 2nd (Sun)-6th(Thur) of 2017.  I have about 50k UR after a whoopsie mistake with United, but 133k in AA.  No access to SW cards at the moment unless my SO applied, but she wants to wait until January 2017 for CP from 1/1/17-12/31/19.

It looks like AA availability is just as bad.  Economy flights (15k) will only get us into MBJ on Monday, April 3rd and back to BOS on Fri April 7th, which doesn't work.  Business/First Class (25k) flights work for both the 4/2 and 4/6.  So, for me and my SO it would be 100k AA.  That leaves me 33k in AA left and then I'll get another 100k between Citigold and Citi Business, so no real loss there.

Has anyone used Biz/FC on AA before?  This is something I would have preferred to use on a longer flight but neither of us have flown Biz/FC before and this doesn't sound like the worst time to cash in on it.  Just looking for some feedback.  Thanks!","['Options do indeed look pretty grim. Look at flying just to an AA hub with cash then award flight to MBJ, and using UR transferred to BA. This lets you save the AA miles, but costs a little more cash.

For some reason that 1 day is more expensive cash wise than the whole rest of the week. Have you thought about moving the trip 1 day forward or back. Zilara cancellation/change policy is strict but I think its only 60 days so you should be able to make changes. I would never go through 100K AA to get back and forth to MBJ. That is almost a true INTL J class to Europe. ', 'Don\'t waste the miles on that flight. As a leisure route it tends to get the shittiest aircraft in the fleet.

If you\'re flying from PHL or CLT, you can expect the old US A320s, which suck. \n\nIf AA is your only choice, then AA is your only choice, but prepare to feel like you wasted miles.

There is no cost other than the mileage difference (and sAAver seats need to be available) to upgrade from a coach award to a business award. Domestic first isn't much to write home about, and the meals to/from the Caribbean are usually not as nice as other domestic meals as it is a low yield destination.\n\nOn the departure, I would wait at this point. Worst comes to worst, you'll likely have the Southwest cards by January and can book a companion fare to MBJ.\n\nIf you want a safe bet, for the return book the 11:40a MBJ-PHL-BOS option (returning to BOS on Friday). AA allows changes as long as the origin and destination stay the same, so if/when 2 seats on a Thursday evening PHL-BOS open up, you can switch to that flight without worrying about finding availability to/from MBJ again. If an option via MIA/CLT open, you can switch to those as well.""]"

Santiago to NZ/Austalia or maybe HKG. Get to HKG somehow. HKG to Europe. Europe back to USA. \nAlternatively you could do East Coast to Europe through maybe Dublin with Avios.

I've got 155k UR, 65k AA, 68k UA, 33k AA, 60k DL, 3k Jetblue. I also have 40k SPG, but I want to use that for our hotel.

Points and prices are for 2 tickets.

* SFO>JFK 12/22/16 Jetblue - transfer 38,500 MR points to Jetblue, $11.20 in fees (or pay $444)
* JFK>MSY  12/29/16 Jetblue - transfer 31,250 MR points to Jetblue, $41.65 plus $11.20 in fees (or pay $408)
* MSY>OAK 1/3/16 Southwest - transfer 35,000 UR points to SW, $11.20 in fees (or pay $518)

Total:
69,750 MR
35,000 UR
3,000 Jetblue
$75.45 in fees

versus paying $1,370 in cash

And, if you have any destination suggestions besides New Orleans, I'd love to hear your ideas! The only things we rejected are Mexico beach towns, ski vacations, and Europe and Japan since those are our other planned trips.","['> Do you think this domestic itinerary is a ""waste"" of award points?\n\nYes, but that\'s just me. I think almost any domestic itinerary is a waste of points.\n\n> I know that\'s subjective, but I also know this isn\'t a high value use, but we don\'t care about first class redemptions - we\'d earn and burn for as many trips in economy as we can. \n\nFair enough, but at 1.3cpm I\'d say that\'s bad value. \n\nIf you have tons of miles to burn, that\'s cool but at ~105k miles, that\'s an SQ F flight to SIN one way or almost enough for a RT in J to Europe.\n\nI personally would pay cash for that routing.\n', 'if your finances can afford it, I\'d pay for these expenses out of pocket and save the ""burn"" your points on a better redemption.', 'Well as you mentioned this is all subjective... but I would rarely consider using points for less than 1.5cpp. ', ""I'd probably pay with points plus cash using the UR portal or TYP portal (i'm not sure you have any points in this program). You can get decent value and split it up. With the 1.25 redemption you could spend around ~60k-70k UR points plus around $500-$600. That way you can still earn some points for the flight, use pints and still pay a little out of pocket since the redemption rate is a little low (if that bothers you at all)."", ""Even internationally, we put our points toward economy seating. It just doesn't bother us to fly that way, and we'd rather get more trips for the same points. It means our cpm is usually lower, but since we'd never pay the going rate for a first class ticket, first class cpm values feel artificially inflated. Different strokes.\n\nBut yeah, the fact that the MR to Jetblue transfer isn't 1:1 is diminishing the value of this idea of mine."", ""We have money, but it's easier for me to get more points than more cash. But, then again, there's the points we could earn by paying cash for these flights.\n\nUgh, I need a better spreadsheet for these calculations!\n\nBetween the two of us, we fly 10-15 coast to coast domestic roundtrips a year, plus a few shorter hauls, so I guess I'm dealing with the temptation of offsetting the cost of some those flights (Southwest companion pass doesn't work for us). Those domestic flights are our biggest annual expense outside of basics like food, rent, health insurance, and self-employment taxes. It pains me to see that item so big in our budget.\n\nThanks for the food for thought!"", ""Thanks, it's helpful to have that number as a standard."", ""Completely agree. It's all about how much value you get out of it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you feel like you've gotten a good deal, that's good enough. I've taken one too many trips to Asia in coach and if possible will not do so again."", ""This is my personal opinion, but to me, cash is king. If you can get mediocre return on your points (about 1.3cpp), its a lot better than paying cash. Nobody can predict when you will need that cash, emergencies, etc. Knowing that you don't plan to travel in the next year anyways, you will have time to recoup those points. Just my opinion. Churning is a way for me to not use my cash, not get the best return on my points."", ""Interesting! I've had the opposite reaction. The more I travel, the less I care about the flight. It probably helps that most of my international travel is for long trips, I'm short, don't get jet lag, and can sleep even in economy. The hours on the plane are easily forgotten after that much time traveling.\n\nThat said, I found a VX first class international flight that was a bargain low number of points (one of the few upsides of their revenue-based redemption). VX's first class apparently isn't all that impressive, but since that's the flight at the end of a relaxing beach vacation and I had no other use for those points in the next year, I decided to splurge."", 'I agree. There\'s also the seemingly constant point devaluation problem, hence my earn and burn approach. And, $1,300 buys a lot of bignets! \n\nI\'m starting to feel like we have enough points we can be a little ""wasteful."" We still have plenty of credit cards we can get, too. Among other things, husband\'s only at 4/24 so can try for the Ink+ and he doesn\'t have ANY Amex cards yet. He also just got approved for the 70k UA card, and combined with points we already have, we\'re swimming in UA points that we\'re planning on using for our Europe 2017 trip.', 'We (family of 4) are headed to CPH, AMS and DUB next month by opening 2 CSPs and 1 Ink+ with a little of MS thrown in. Booked all our flights through UA, going there is LH metal and back is UA metal. Going for a full month, should be interesting with a 2 and 5 year old, but we are bringing a psuedo nanny.', ""Wow, sounds great. Did a UA redemption for 2 last summer, SFO>JFK stopover>DUB, then ZAG with 24 hours in MUC, back to SFO. Dubrovnik is utterly jam packed with tourists but still beautiful. Lokrum was a worthwhile half day trip from there, and would give the kids space to run around.\n\nNext summer we have a wedding near Florence, and we're thinking of adding on Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, and/or Copenhagen for 3 weeks total (we've been to Italy a couple of times). We'll open jaw, and do travel by train and cheap European flights in between. Unfortunately we'll burn our UA award stopover in New York to see family, but that means we don't have to do NY as a separate trip some other time. UA award routing is so great for how we like to travel. I'm already looking forward to it!""]"

* Are there any Platinum card benefits that will make booking this easier? 
* Is there any way we can leave via LGA so we can check out the Centurion Club?

You\'ll have to either find someone on here more knowledgeable than me who knows Korean air (or other airline) change policies, but I think you could figure something out. It would have to be within a year of your first leg of the flight though. United stopover rules come to mind (how you can end your trip with an open jaw, basically come back to home location and then continue on to another spot in the US at some point. So like nyc - Australia - nyc, then 300 days later you could ""finish"" the trip with NYC - Florida or something, basically netting you a free one way ticket in the US. ']"
174,Newbie needs suggestions,5,4oa9jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4oa9jz/newbie_needs_suggestions/,11,1466060748.0,"We are about to embark on a major renovation which is going to take months. They are saying 3, but you know how it goes. Might as well double that. 

At all times the contractor is saying we can continue to live in our place -- we just may not want to, especially during the week. So I have been researching alternatives like airbnb, to fill in the times we may want to vacate the premises on short notice. I already travel a fair amount for business (about 40-50%).... and it occurred to me like a big d'oh that I could play this points game for free hotel stays... in our own town. 

I.e., no flights, just hotel stays, is our goal. We don't even care that much if it's a fancy hotel, as long as it's spackle free and close enough to work. 

Though I travel for work I have never really been interested in collecting points because long ago I used to be a couponer and I burned myself out on that game. I figured points were similar. But now I have motive... if even just for the short term.

I don't have a lot of points to start (about 40K Jetblue, 5K SPG), but I do have some travel coming up and will continue throughout the reno period. For work I nearly always stay at either a Starwoods or a Marriott. At home, we live in a big city with just about every option. I just signed up for Marriott Rewards and submitted some recent folios hoping they might comp me. I also signed up for the MR CC for the 80K points. I otherwise have little interest in becoming a churner. 

So... if you were in this situation, how would you play this?  What would your strategy be? ","[""Wow, for one of you are traveling for work close to 50% of the time you could have some great status that would bet you some nice rewards. To be honest I'm not that well versed in hotel points other than Hyatt/SPG but even then I have aimed for more expensive hotels rather than something to stay on for weeks at a time. Best of luck and please, please sign up for rewards programs. "", 'My strategy would be to sign up for all the main hotel credit cards (SPG, IHG, Hyatt, Marriott) and use your remodeling expenses to hit the minimum spends, then turn around and use those points for hotel stays during the rest of the renovation period.', ""Don't forget to sign up for other cards that can transfer to hotels as well. Chase UR can transfer to Hyatt, Marriott, and IHG. Hyatt house comes with a full fridge and kitchen so you wouldn't have to eat out everyday. Their hotels also start at 5k per night. "", ""If you can get your hands on an IHG card for 70-80k points after $1k spend and then use the IHG share forever promotion to earn/ offset your stays that may work. You can also check IHG point breaks for 5k nights in your town though they aren't pervasive and change quarterly. "", ""If you really don't care about anything other than a clean place to sleep, and hotel prices are reasonable in your town, I'd be using that as an excuse to do a one-time season of mattress running to earn a crapton of points for future travel.  It sounds like you might be in a perfect position to hotel hop - it's a hassle on trips but if you're close enough to home where you don't have to lug your stuff around...  Single night stays usually offer the best earnings.  I'd also look really hard at all the chains that offer free nights, points, or credit for BRGs - IHG, Choice, SPG, Wyndham, Hilton, Best Western...  They vary from being able to book one per week per person to one per month per household.\n\nWyndham has a couple promos right now that can yield 22k points per person for six stays with $100 of that being paid by gift cards from one of the promos.  Choice is probably doing the 4k points per stay promo that they run regularly.  Marriott will usually offer a challenge, and I think you can still request that they offer an easier one based on stays instead of nights.  Definitely check out their deals section to see if anything in your area offers a decent chunk of points per night if the idea of switching hotels bothers you.\n\nCheck out frequentflyerbonuses.com for current promo listings - fair warning, some there are outdated - because the frequently available 3k airmiles per stay at a cheap hotel can be quite a bargain.  \n\n\nYou can message me directly if you want some help with options but don't want to publicly state your location. "", ""Yeah, I know, right? It's only been the last 2 years with that travel schedule. I did sign up to SPG ages ago, I was just sloppy about giving my # to get the points. I did submit a bunch of old folios and they credited me recently, which was nice. I only just signed up for Marriott though. \n\n"", ""I second this - if you're on the road that much, you should already be rolling in the points!  All my travel is out of pocket, and I still had enough points to put my SO up in hotels for two months after a recent move for work.  "", ""You left out Hilton.  Heck, maybe sign up for Club Carlson, Fairmont, and Wyndham too -- it all depends on what's available at a good points rate in your town."", 'Well the good news is spg has a 3k per night category if you can find a hotel in that category. Also working your way up to platinum can be quite nice as well. ', ""Wouldn't it make more sense to just choose one or two to focus on, to rack up the points? Rather than spreading out the points among multiple programs?

175,T5 Lounge Options at JFK,8,3nm0gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/3nm0gi/t5_lounge_options_at_jfk/,24,1444101731.0,"I got a killer deal ($130 r/t on Jetblue) on a flight out to Lake Tahoe do to some snowboarding in February. I'd guess that the flight will leave out of Jetblue's T5. What is my best bet for Priority Pass lounge? I can't find much on it and only saw a mediocre pay-per-entry lounge in T5. How close it T4 or T1? 

On the same note, does Reno/Tahoe INTL have any lounges? You'd think a ritzy place like that would have some, but I can't seem to find any.","[""I did the round trip from T5 to T4 a few weeks ago. It took about 15-20 mins to get there and through security. This was at 3:30pm on Sunday of Labor Day weekend, so not a heavy traffic time. You may need more time if it's busier. We went to the Wingtips lounge in T4, and it was fine. Security at T4 will tell you that you are in the wrong place, just tel them you are going to the lounge, and they will let you through without hassle. You will have to do security again at T5, so make sure you have enough time. If you got Global Entry from Prestige, make sure JetBlue has your KTN, so you can get pre check, that might save you some security time. "", ""Do you have the AMEX Platinum?  That gets you into the Airspace lounge for free at T5 - it's the pay per entry lounge that you found.  You get a $10 credit towards food or drink with your entry.  I'm going to try it out on Sunday.  I wouldn't pay to get in, but I'll for sure check it out for free, especially since the two of us will get $20 worth of stuff for nothing."", '...howd you get that deal tho', ""I got back from my trip and am reporting back, as promised!  The Airspace lounge was ok.  As expected, it was very small, although I didn't realize just how small.  There are probably only 40 seats.  Luckily for us, on a Sunday afternoon it was empty.  I think there were only eight other people besides the two of us, and three of them were in the closed off tv room watching the pre-football show.  With our $20 credit (they put it all on one card) we ordered a cheese plate and a charcuterie plate.  They were both pretty good, the charcuterie being the better of the two.  We also got some of the chex mix and put it in a paper cup with a lid so we could take what we didn't finish onto the plane with us as a snack.  We didn't get drinks, but they do offer one of our favorite red wines, which we may have gone for if it had been a bit later in the day.  The only bad thing for me was the bathroom wasn't as clean as I would have liked.  I'm going to be going back again next month for a flight to Vegas - I'll probably hit the same lounge and maybe get some wine instead of food next time.\n\nAs for precheck, it was awesome!!!!  I had input my KTN, but my boyfriend hasn't gotten his yet.  The tickets were both booked by me and we both ended up getting precheck both at JFK and MCO.  We screwed up initially at JFK, getting in the even more speed line (we'd upgraded to even more space seats).  We got to the front of the line quickly with only a couple people in front of us, but a decent line of at least 10 people waiting at each of the security stations.  The TSA rep was very nice and told us we should have walked down further to go into the special precheck lane, about 50 yards further down.  Since there was a line, they opened up the ropes for us to let us out and we walked down there.  There was only one person in front of us in precheck and then we walked right through the scanners.  Done in less than 3 minutes.  At MCO, it was even better.  There was a long line for regular security - over 100 people.  For precheck we walked right up and then only had to wait behind five people to get scanned.  Getting through security quickly is usually a stress point for us, so having the precheck was wonderful. "", ""Good to know. So maybe give myself 30 minutes each way since it is a Thursday night at 5pm? How did you like the lounge?\n\nI've heard that even with GE, one might not always get selected. In your experience, do you get it most times? What if you're with a traveler who doesn't have it?"", ""Let me know how you like it! I don't have AMEX Platinum right now, but plan on possibly getting it next year. I'm full on Citi Prestige TYPs and working on generous retention offers. I don't fly Jetblue a lot; they are the only airline in that terminal, right?"", 'Well, Jetblue offered those $30 flights on Halloween so I was just searching other random dates and there are a lot of cheap flights in the next few months. I bought 10 tickets for a big trip with family and friends. ', ""That's awesome! Thanks so much for taking the time to check back and report on your experiences. It sounds like the lounge was decent, but was it worth the price would you say? If you had to pick that or transit to T4 and back for a free nicer lounge with Priority Pass, which would you choose?\n\nCan we add our KTN to a ticket we've already booked? Also, I booked ten tickets for a bunch of family as we got a great deal on a Lake Tahoe trip this winter. Any chance we could all get precheck on my KTN? lol. \n\nWas the precheck a random thing or was it automatic? You go right up to it after they check your boarding pass?"", ""This was my first time at JFK, I've heard it can get pretty busy. 30 mins sounds good to me, but I'd check with others on security line times. I'd hate for you to miss your flight because of a long line! \n\nThe lounge was fine, they didn't put out any hot food until right as we were leaving, at 5 pm, so I just had a basic sandwich and a few beers. Chairs were comfortable, but just a basic lounge. \n\nI got pre check on both of the domestic flights I've taken since having it. It's new to me, so I can't make a pattern, but from talking to other Pre people, I get the impression that they get it most of the time. "", ""It's primarily JetBlue, but I believe Hawaiian and Aer Lingus also use T5.  It's a pretty good terminal even without a lounge.  We fly out of there a few times a year and the food court options are better than most - make your own salads, Boar's Head sandwiches made to order, etc.  Definitely better than some of the other terminals we've used.  This will be my first time flying after getting my Global Entry, so we'll see how that goes.  I had to update my reservation online with my middle name and KTN - hopefully they took.  My boyfriend doesn't have it yet since he's in the process of renewing his passport and we figured we'd just wait a few weeks until the new one arrives.  We'll see if I end up in pre-check and he doesn't....."", ""I feel like I'm stalking your thread, but wanted to chime in on that great sale!!  I got a non-stop flight out to Vegas from JFK next month for only 4k points, which is unheard of.  Now I just need to figure out my way back.  The sale didn't cover my return date, but I have a few other options."", ""We got into the lounge for free by having the AMEX Platinum card.  I wouldn't pay $25.  Transiting between terminals sounds like kind of a pain, but if you get there really early and want to enjoy a lounge experience, I guess it could be ok.  I'll consider it for my trip in Nov, but I don't check luggage, so I'd just start at T4 for the lounge and then head to T5 for the flight.  Do be aware that JetBlue closes the plane doors 15 min before the departure time.  We left the lounge a little late and my boyfriend stopped off to buy food.  When we got to the gate between 20-25 min before departure, almost everyone had already boarded.  I think only the standby people boarded after us.\n\nI added my KTN after I had booked this trip - it wasn't an issue.  I also had to update my JetBlue profile to add my middle name so that it matched perfectly with my goes profile.\n\nI have no idea if they'd give ten tickets all the precheck.  You'll find out if you got the precheck or not when you check-in to your flight and get your boarding pass.  So we both knew about 24 hours before the flights that we had precheck since we checked in using the phone app.  \n\nYou enter into a separate line for precheck.  If you're taking the airtrain between terminals at JFK, you'll walk through a bunch of long hallways to get to T5 and then take an escalator down.  You'll pass the check-in/baggage drop area and then see the security entrance.  You skip that one and keep going way further down.  The precheck line is way at the end.  You could also just ask a worker if you don't see it.  Your boarding pass says TSA precheck at the top.  They'll check your ID and you go into security where you get to keep your shoes/belt on plus no taking out your laptop/ipad or your liquids.  We got to go through the regular metal scanners instead of the scanners where you have to stand and hold your hands over your head.  So much easier than the regular security lines."", ""I'm really interested to see what happens witht he pre-check. It'd be great if you could report back. I'm applying for it now since I get it for free with Prestige...how long does it take to get an appointment? I figure I'll get it first and then maybe pay for my wife to get it. "", 'Was that on jetblue??', ""Sounds like a great experience! Thanks for sharing! I can't wait to see if I get precheck or not! And I don't travel with any checked luggage either. So do I need to go through two different security checkpoints with my carry-on when moving between the 2 terminals? I've never terminal hopped before."", ""Will do!  Yeah, I paid for mine out of pocket because the building I work at was offering special on site appointments for people who work there.  Then my approval didn't come through until the day after they were doing the interviews there - ugh!  I ended up going downtown to the Bowling Green location at the American Indian Museum.  My wait time was two months for the appointment.  I kept checking back for cancellations, but never had any luck.  When I went in a couple weeks ago, one of the workers told me they were booked up through November.  I've heard actually going to JFK is a short 1-2 week wait for an appointment, but I had no flights booked other than this one coming up and as I live in Upper Manhattan, it's not convenient to hop on down to JFK.  It was much easier for me to make the lunchtime appointment at Bowling Green - I was in/out in about 10-15 minutes."", ""Yep - last Thursday.  Luckily I had just transferred in a bunch of points from doing surveys a week before - the timing couldn't have been better."", ""Ahh, I thought since you said transit to T4 and back that you'd be checking luggage.  You'd just start at T4 and then take the airtrain to T5.  Yes, you'd need to go through security twice, once at each terminal, with your carry-on.  When you leave T4, be sure to get on the airtrain to Howard Beach/Jamaica Station as that train runs the circle upward in terminals (so T5 is the next stop) whereas the terminal only train on the other side of the platform runs down in terminals.  You don't want to end up at T2, accidentally!  And be prepared walking from the airtrain to T5 is a bit of a hike - probably 5min of walking down corridors until you get to the actual terminal."", ""That's good to know! I usually take the train down from southern CT, so it would be much more convenient for me to take the 4 or 5 to Bowling Green than it would to get to JFK, which isn't worth driving to and is annoying at best on public transit. I wonder if it's worth it if I can get an appointment right away at JFK. "", ""What a deal! I didn't know that the cheap revenue flights translated to cheap award flights!\n"", 'Awesome, thanks for the helpful tips. On a Thursday evening, with a flight departing at 7:30 pm, how much time would you allow, approximately, between the lounge at T5 and the gate at T4? ', ""Yes, getting to Bowling Green couldn't be easier.  The 4/5 is right outside the museum or the R is also only a block away.  It does take about 7-10 days after you submit your application before you get the approval and only then can you schedule the interview appointment online. "", 'One of the upsides of revenue-based points. ', ""Let's see.....maybe 5 min to walk to the airtrain from the lounge, 5 min for the next airtrain to show, 3 min on the train, 5 min to walk to security at T5, say an average 15 min wait at security (should be shorter with precheck, but you never know) and another 5 min to walk to your gate if you're at one of the further ones.  That's just about 40 min and you want to get there about 30 min before the flight time, so I'd plan on departing the lounge around 6:20-ish.\n\nI'm not sure exactly about wait times on a Thurs night.  I do like this site, though - http://www.ifly.com/john-f-kennedy-international-airport/wait-times\n\nYou could check Thurs evening wait times the couple of weeks before your flight to get a better feel for how long the wait might be.""]"

I don't plan on earning anymore since they're so hard to earn and the bonuses are once per lifetime, and since the program may go away in the next couple years I figure I would run down my balance.

However, SPG points are the most valuable points currency in the world and I'm almost scared to use them. I've been doing a bit of research and I think some of the best hotel redemptions I've seen are at their lower end hotels...

The Aloft Cancun, for example, is a mid-range hotel in a prime location near all the luxury beach all-inclusive resorts (Ziva, Zilara, etc) in Cancun and rates can approach $200 a night at this hotel. As a Category 2 property, however, they require only 4,000 points a night, or 3,000 on the weekends. That can be 5+ cents per point in value!

JAL, a unique transfer partner of SPG, offers some great promotions, such as 30,000 miles roundtrip to Brazil on oneworld partner TAM. Given that roundtrips to Brazil from NYC are currently about $1,500 in economy, and you only need to transfer 25,000 SPG points to get 30,000 JAL miles, that's a value of 6 cents per point... 

I know a lot of people liked to transfer to Alaska for good redemptions in J/F on Emirates, but recent devaluations made this less appealing... if there are still good uses for transferring to Alaska, I'd like to hear about it...

If you were able to get in on the Virgin America+JetBlue points match promotion, then you could have gotten 50,000 Virgin America miles matched to 75,000 JetBlue miles for the cost of just 40,000 SPG points...

Even if you missed out on the Virgin America/JetBlue promotion, Virgin America has some great partner redemptions like 40k roundtrip in economy (35k SPG points) or 80k roundtrip (65k SPG points) roundtrip LAX-SYD on Virgin Australia...

tl;dr: I can probably get myself up to 200-250k Avios if I put all my eggs into the Avios basket. But is it worth it?

**First things first - my current balances**

	JetBlue Airways (trueBlue) **	21,787

We do not MS. I probably can't get the full 100k Avios from the current offer without MS, but if I open an LRCU account I can easily get 50k + 25k = 75k avios.

Note 1: we have the SW companion pass via my wife's account through 12/16. So no sense going for more SW points right now, we'll focus on that late next year to re-up our CP.

Note 2: Neither of us is eligible for CSP thanks to new rules. Original plan was to get 2 of those. Wife had it once 3 years ago. I have Ink+ Biz card and earn 1200 points monthly from auto billpay to cable/phone companies.

Note 3: I am not getting the current United 50k targeted offer, only the 30k offer.	

Note 4: Wife got 50k Amex MR bonus in 2014, converted points to BA Avios during 1.4x redemption, card is cancelled. Neither of us have had the Amex platinum.

Note 5: We do not MS. I am open to the idea of the $15k LRCU account hack, though.

Note 6: FICO 812, income is good.

**My trip desires**

My wife is a teacher and I have decent vacation time. We'd like to do 3-4 weeks somewhere we haven't been before that won't break the bank with food/hotels. Ideal destinations include Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Budapest, all of Asia, India, all of Africa (esp S. Africa), all of Australia/NZ. Flexible travel dates late July/August 2016. Asia is probably highest on the list for both of us, but we're open.

It would be fun to move around a bit during the trip, but neither of us love flying so we mostly want to have one long travel day coming and going and minimize flying around once we're there. 1-2 additional flight days max during the trip. It would be fun to travel in business or first but we're not going to kill ourselves getting points to upgrade. 

I've never been to London and would be open to 3-4 days there even though it's an expensive city. But I'd rather not pay their enormous taxes on ""free"" flights.

Not interested in anywhere US, Canada, Caribbean, Latin America, or Eastern Europe for this trip - we want to go somewhere new :)

Home airport is Boston, easy enough to get to JFK via JetBlue points if necessary.

**Card thoughts**

Wife and I can probably swing one more card each this fall, depending on minimum spend. Then we can probably do another card each in the winter. So we want to put those cards towards points so we can redeem them early. In the winter we can probably each do another card, probably go for hotel cards at that point. Might go for a third set of cards next spring, again with hotel cards.

My original plan was to load up on Chase UR points by getting each of us a CSP. But that plan is now ruined thanks to the 5/24 rule.

I was then going to go for United points by going for the Chase United cards, but the 50k deals seem to have vanished except for business cards - I have a biz card via Ink, not sure if I can get the United biz card or not.

Looks like I missed the 100k Amex Platinum deal (I was on vacation using my SW companion pass, so I won't complain too much!).

Am still keeping my fingers crossed that the 140k RC offer comes back so we can do a fly + stay redemption.

I have zero use for airport lounge access, fee reimbursements, or most other perks. All I want is points.

**Questions**

Given my limited options to get more AA points, get Chase UR points via CSP, or get a decent stockpile of United miles, it seems like I should focus on BA. But I have never heard anything good about Avios except short haul (we don't want short haul for this trip) and have never had great experiences with their website. And since flying F or J on BA is now ludicrously expensive via points AND has huge surcharges on BA metal via London, I'm hesitant to go all in on Avios. So...

* Should I transfer my MR points to BA before the devaluation on 10/1?
* Should I go for the current BA card offer, recognizing that I don't MS and this might present an opportunity cost if some other better offer comes up?
* Are there other offers I'm missing that will help us have a truly memorable trip?
* If I do go all-in on Avios, is there some amazing routing/destination that will maximize my fun with Avios? I really don't care too much where we go next summer as long as it's new to us and beautiful.
* If I decide not to pursue Avios as a strategy, what's should I do instead?

Thanks!","['As you said, for long haul travel, especially in J or F to Asia, Avios are near useless.\n110k AA miles RT CX J is by far the best deal to SE Asia , so I would pick up the 75k offer on the Citi executive giving you nearly 210k AA and almost  enough for 2 round trips to most places in Asia ', ""Avios can be very valuable for repositioning flights once you get to the continent of your destination. Since you're looking to go to Asia for 3-4 weeks, I think it's safe to assume you're going to be hopping around a bit. Avios become incredibly valuable in that scenario, especially if you're looking to fly J/F. For example, I'm flying HND-HKG and then later on HKG-SIN for 11k Avios each + ~$140. The flights are in J and would have cost me around $4,500 had I actually paid for them.\n\nAre Avios good for long haul flights? Well, that depends on what you consider to be good value. CX for example flies BOS-HKG direct. J tickets on AA will cost you 55k miles and F tickets will set you back 67.5k miles. Using Avios, that same flight will set you back 150k + $52 in taxes/fees in J and 200k + $52 in taxes/fees in F. Clearly the better deal is using AA miles, but if you can't get extra AA miles, then Avios may still be a worthwhile proposition. Alternatively, if you used your CP to get yourself out to LA, the cost of Avios goes down to 105k for J and 140k for F. \n\nIf it was me, my strategy would be building up enough AA points for CX/JL flights to and from Asia, and then stockpile Avios to use for the connecting flights getting you to a bunch of different cities."", ""If you decide to do Europe the Avios could be useful there. Boston-Dublin on Aer Lingus using Avios is one of the best redemptions in the whole system. It's also an unusually short transatlantic flight. Once in Dublin you can use Avios for a cheap trip into London.\n\nThe key will be to fly back to Dublin or on to somewhere like Spain before flying back to the US. The exit taxes for the UK depend on how far away you're flying and in what class, so doing an economy flight to a nearby country and booking a separate nice flight from there is minimizes the crazy UK taxes."", ""For UA, try logging into united.com, click on the 30k card ad, click on 'are you a business owner', click on 'not a business owner'."", ""If I were you, I would choose the most affordable option when it goes to flights and transfer.

A churner and friend and I are looking to book a trip to Europe using award points. We are open to landing anywhere in continental Europe, but I have already been to Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Prague, so those places are less preferred. 

We would like to go to 4 different cities in Europe in 17 days. It is preferable that we have a one way in one city, and than a one way back from a different city. If it is much cheaper just to do round trip, then we can do that as well. Also we are willing to spend more points on business/first class if it is a great value. It's all about the value! We definitely want to go to Budapest, but other cities of interest are Krakow, Cyprus, Amalfi, Athens, Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, and somewhere in Switzerland. 

Our point totals are below:

My points: Cap One - 44k AA - 34k UR - 140k AMEX MR - 122k Hilton - 97k Delta - 64k Marriott - 11k United - 73k Barclaycard - 46k JetBlue - 3k

This allows them to do so. 3) People who have the money and would buy the Biz/First tickets anyway but instead use points. Number 3 is the only one who qualifies to use CPP as retail price divided by miles used. For everyone else, if you were to see what they would be willing to pay to fly in business (vs. the $4k-$5k it costs), the CPP would likely be much lower.\n\nWith the rant mostly over, let me break it down:\n\n* If you want a good value for your miles, 1.5 actual cents per point (as you'd probably buy tickets anyway) is still good. Get a decent fare sale and you can probably use your Arrival or Cap One points for the main flights.\n\n* If you want to fly business and just don't want to blow all of your miles doing it, that's fine. But it is probably not the best value when you'd spend 2.5-3x the number of miles to do so compared to going in coach.

Another option is Flying Blue if they have a mile sale for 25-50% off DC business awards.

* 1) This flight is the most expensive of the 3. Way more than I have ever paid! The UR's website has the same flight for the same price of buying directly from American but it's also offering 33K points for it. I would use 66k points (me + wife) for it, instead of $986.

* 2) This one could be cheaper, but it's ok. Southwest offers the same flight for 7K points (compared to $119). I have 4k with Southwest and my wife has 9K, so I would only have to transfer 3K points from my UR to Southwest. We don't mind using the points we have with Southwest for this trip, and 3K from my UR doesn't seem to much. Is this worth it?!?

* 3) Finally the last flight. UR's website is offering the flight for 12K points (compared to $185). Is this worth it?!?


I might be wrong, but I don't think it's worth spending 66K points on the first flight. But I could spend 3K on the flight #2 (and compliment with existing points in our Southwest accounts) and maybe (depending on what you guys say) another 24K for the flight #3.

Ideas? Suggestions? What should I do?? 

Thank you so much for your help.

G","['1) For a one way flight from Boston to Phoenix that seems a little bit high. But you\'re also purchasing on Dec 23 which is right in the middle of one of the busiest times of the year so don\'t expect a deal here. The redemption via UR gives you 1.5cpp which is the minimum you\'ll ever get one travel with UR. The only way you could do better is by transferring UR to AA (or a oneworld partner) and redeeming them for an award flight. I suspect award flights will be scarce or non-existent for that date.\n\n2) This seems to be worth it. Southwest redemptions are revenue-based (aka the cost in points is roughly pegged to the cost of the ticket) so there aren\'t really any ""bad"" redemptions for SW\n\n3) Again, you\'re getting 1.5cpp. That\'s not a bad deal, but it\'s the minimum you\'ll ever get for using UR points with a CSR. You could do potentially better down the road by transferring to partner airlines and getting 2cpp+, but it depends on whether or not you mind putting up the cash now in order to get better return on your points later.', '*Update:*\n\n * I transferred 3K points from UR to Southwest and got the flight #2.

The 20K is a good deal, specially if you compare to what UR is offering (33K) but then I have to pay $186. That kind of defeats the purpose right?!?! \n\nOne more question, if I want to book this AA flight, how should I do it? I know I could transfer points to my Avios account, but I can't find any flights from BOS-PHX (nor DEN-BOS) using BA's website. This also apply for non-awards tickets. Am I doing something wrong??

We are basically open to travel anywhere (Europe, Puerto Rico, caribbean, etc) and are looking for suggestions based on the points we have etc. What will make the most sense, fun, etc. 

Based on initial research it looks like Colombia could be the best option. It will cost $900 roundtrip from IAD to MDE (Medellin). Domestic travel within Colombia is cheap. $70 one way from MDE to Cartagena. Using points for this trip looks like a massive rip off, with Delta wanting 120k points roundtrip from IAD to Cartagena, and United having black out dates for January 2-3. 

Another potential option would be for us to fly to Ft. Lauderdale, relax for a few days around Miami, and then fly to Havana from Ft Lauderdale. The roundtrip flight from Ft. lauderdale to Havana is only about $400. I don't know how spending NYE in Havana will be however...

With that being said, it does NOT have to be colombia, but I have looked around the Caribbean, Europe, and South America, and everything looks to be a tremendous rip-off.

This is the first time I will be redeeming reward points and I am in a bit of a dilemma. I would greatly appreciate any help. 

I have PTO planned for 17 days from 9/30/16 to 10/16/16. This vacation can move up a week to 10/6/16 to 10/23/16 if needed, however I wanted to make sure I get Columbus day in there as a Federal Holiday. 

I've been looking at flights and the reward flights suck getting to Lima. 

On 9/30, there is a 10:30am - 11:30am flight from DCA to Lima on JetBlue using 18.9k points + $20 fees. This flight is $320 out of pocket. *I would be transferring my Amex points to JetBlue*

On 10/16 - there is a 8am-9pm flight on AA using 17.5k points. I think this is a great deal. 

So getting to Lima is the problem. I waste an entire PTO day on Friday because of the flight time. There is an attractive option on Thursday to fly from 6:30pm -5:30am (arrive Friday morning) from AA, but AA is pricing that flight at 50k reward points. 

So I really have two options:

1) Pay $608 out of pocket for AA round trip for Thursday 6:30pm-5:30am (Friday morning) - this way I gain the entire Friday and it won't be wasted. 
- I have a $600 negative balance on my AA platinum card, so I could put the charge on there.
2) Use 18.9k JetBlue points (Transferred from Amex) and 17.5k AA points, and lose out on most of all of Friday. By the time I get from Lima Airport to my hostel, it will be midnight...

Points totals:
Amex - 150k
Delta - 60k
AA - 57k (but soon should be 82k after they credit me from AA gold card)

I've read Hawaiian Airlines is the best partner redemption for VA Elevate miles both in terms of availability and surcharges... but on the VA site, it lists only Economy (35K RT JFK-HNL) and Business (80K RT JFK-HNL) and on the HA site there's Main Cabin, Extra Comfort and First class.  Is Business on the VA site referring to ""Extra Comfort"" or First Class?

Also, what's the catch with the JFK-FRA award? It's 20K RT +$147 in fees through Singapore and that sounds way too good.

I hope this is the correct forum for this post, and if not would certainly appreciate any guidance to be pointed in the right forum. I am looking to create the following itinerary. At this moment, I am pricing it out as all cash, but would be happy to use miles should the value be there. At the moment the flights I've found do not yield a good redemption value.

Given the schedule below, could anyone suggest any adjustments to either 

*  A) Save some $ using a different routing 
*  B) Save some $ using mileage with good redemptions

Lastly, would it be advisable to use a travel consultant? And if so, any suggestions would be appreciated!!

Goal:

* **Flight 1:** Miami to Jakarta (March 27th)
* **Flight 2:**  Jakarta to Las Vegas (May 4th)
* **Flight 3:** Las Vegas to Jakarta (May 9th)

We're pretty budget conscious, but also realize there are some experiences that are always worth the money. She's unfortunately a little scared of credit cards, so I am the only one with points. I currently have: 

 - 134k MR
 - 61k AA
 - 41k United
 - 25k Alaska & companion pass
 - 50k Avios (technically my dads, but he doesn't care for this sort of thing)
 - 14k Hyatt, 1 free anniversary night, & Platinum
 - Fairmont 3rd night free and 1 room & 1 suite upgrade
 - Fairmont 2 free nights (pending)
 - 80k IHG (pending)
 - 50k AA (pending)
 - 25k JetBlue (pending)
 - 25k Wyndham (pending)
 - Gold at SPG & Hilton through Amex Plat

We are based in NYC, so we have the luxury of being able to fly out of JFK, EWR, or LGA.

**Trip 1**

We would like to visit **Banff** and **Lake Louise**, since all the pictures we've seen are absolutely breathtaking. [[1],](https://images.trvl-media.com/hotels/1000000/20000/13700/13652/13652_81_z.jpg)[ [2]](https://images.trvl-media.com/media/content/shared/images/travelguides/Lake-Louise-10115-smalltabletRetina.jpg).

 - I am thinking that we fly into YYC, and rent a car to drive out to Banff (~1.5 hrs).
 - All of the flights seem to get in later in the day, so we will probably stay for one evening in **Calgary** (hotels seem relatively cheap, probably can do points + cash at a hyatt/ihg)
 - I’d really like to go here in **May**, because I love to golf and their [course](http://www.fairmont.com/banff-springs/golf/) looks awesome. (My SO does not golf, but I'm sure she'll do a yoga class or visit the spa).
 - Seattle had also been in our sites, although I hear it's rather expensive once you're there. Nonetheless, I'd love to take the ferry around to the different islands, and rent a car to visit **Olympic National Park** and **Mt. Rainier**. I'd originally wanted to do a quick trip out here back in March, but realized it's best to see these parks in the warmer months. 
 - This trip would most likely be for 7-8 days, or just 4 if we only go to Canada.

Originally I was thinking to book the flights to Calgary through American (**30k each roundtrip**), but some of connections are a little ridiculous (SEA + LAX in the return to NYC…)

 - Cash tickets are also only ~**$350-375**, so **1.1-1.2 cpm** isn't that great.
 - Thinking it would be better to book through **Alaska** using cash and the **companion pass***, but am not sure if I can book a multi-day layover in Seattle.

**We'd love to go to Hawaii, and realize this is probably the best use of the Alaska companion pass. However, Hawaii is extremely expensive, and we feel we'd enjoy our time better there in a few years when we have a little more money.*


**Trip 2**

We'd also really like to go to Southeast Asia, and see **Bangkok**, **Phuket**, **Saigon**, and **Singapore**. Looks beautiful, and it all seems relatively cheap once you’re there. 

 - I’d like to hit Bangkok for 1-2 days (have a friend teaching there, so i'd like to pay him that visit I’ve been promising him.
 - Some other places we’d like to see are **Phang Nga Bay** and **Pattaya**, **Ko Samui**, **Phuket**, and **Ko Phi Phi** (really touristy, but so beautiful)
 - For this trip we’d be able to go for **10-15 days**, the hotels are all really cheap so this saves us a lot.
 - I am weary of the rain starting to pick up (May-Aug seems bad), so we’d like to do this trip ASAP
 
Seems we'd need to fly into HKG, PEK, NRT, or SIN to get a flight to BKK or HKT.  Another option is take Qatar and transfer through DOH. 

  - I heard you can’t do much on a layover in NRT, so we’d rather transfer through SIN or even HKG (and maybe do a day trip).
  - It seems each leg is **40k** on United, so that would be **160k** between the two of us...
  - This seems like a really bad redemption, as I’m seeing flights for 650-700 round trip (0.8 cpm).
  - The only way I could justify it, was if we got some sweet open jaws that allow us to visit SIN, BKK, HKT, and/or SGN on the same ticket, but idk if that’s possible


A friend who’s been living/teaching in Korea suggested scrapping Thailand and just going to **Bali**, so I was wondering if anyone had any input on awards flights there.  I've researched the destination and agree it's awesome, but it may need to wait for another time.  Would be nice to do some sort of open-jaw/extended layover in **SIN** or **SYD** with a connection to **DPS**, but not sure if this is possible.

**Other Ideas**

Part of us wants to see the world while were young, and another part just wants some nice R&R. We used our two free nights at the Hyatt Regency in Aruba and had a ***blast***. We paid ~$500 in advance to book a third night, but were upgraded to an room oceanfront room that goes for $650/night! We made some newb mistakes like forgetting sunscreen ($15 in gift shop…), but overall it was a great time!

 Another trip we were considering was flying into Cancun and staying at the [**Fairmont Mayakoba**](http://www.fairmont.com/mayakoba-riviera-maya/). Flights to CUN are really cheap (especially on JetBlue), and we could get lucky using the room + suite upgrades. I saw generally good reviews on FT, and there’s also a PGA [golf course](http://www.mayakobagolf.com/course.html) next door… I am not sure if we’d do an all inclusive here (5 nights is a lot), but we may stay for 2 nights and see if we can get a suite upgrade. The other days we rent a car to visit Tulum, and maybe backtrack and stay a night in Cancun.

*Yet another* trip is **Costa Rica**, but this also does not seem like a good place to use miles/points. We could fly in relatively cheaply to Liberia or San Jose (JetBlue has great deals to LIB), and can get around to the different destinations via [Nature Air ](http://www.natureair.com/) (flight + sight seeing in one). 
We would go to the Arenal Volcano Area, but also have also heard Manuel Antonio National Park is really cool as well.  This place looks awesome, but there seems like so much to hit. I don’t mind faring towards the more touristy areas, I heard some parts of the country don’t have paved roads and you could kill a whole day in traffic/getting lost. I’d love to do some all inclusive travel tour that takes care of all that stress for you, but the price is out of our budget for now.


**Final Note**

I realize this post is really long, and probably not the best organized, so thank you for reading it. I don't want to be one of those people who collects points and never uses them, but I also don't want to waste them. It's my understanding the real value is in business/first, but I also hope there's value to be had in economy/coach.

**Edit**

I am aware of close-in booking fees, and too my knowledge the changing the date trick doesn't work anymore (except maybe for Untied?). This is *yet another* reason why cash might be better for Asia, but any input is greatly appreciated!","[""So you have a ton of points, problem is they are really really spread out. For your domestic/shorter flights you should have plenty of points and plenty of options. I'm not really sure what would be best for asia. One option is to look at using your aa miles for one way there and then figure out how you want to get back (off the top of my head MR to SQ might be a good choice).\n\nYou really need to look at exactly where you want to go and then what the best options are to get there and plan accordingly."", ""40k Avios can get two people to SEA and back from JFK in Y on either AA or AS as long as you choose a direct flight, so that's something worth considering.

I don't know if this is necessarily a sign of quality, but most blogs only really cover Business/First Class.\n\nCathay’s stopover is also in Hong Kong, which I think I’d prefer to see over NRT and DOH.\n"", ""So you have some reading to do. Aa award chart is irrelevant for avios redemptions. Its not mix and match. Avios use avios award chart, not aa. Avios could be an option. I've never used them for long haul.

Aa doesn't allow stop overs but I think sq does.\n\nYou need to actually research your specific options. The miles you have each have their own program and their own rules and redemption rates.\n\nEdit: from what I see you basically have to chose aa for one way. Then choose sq or avios for the way back.

Thank you again for your quick response (and your patience).\n\nMR only transfer to Avios at 1:0.8, so I muffed up there too. I think I am going to use my MR on SQ, which should hopefully only be 37.5k each way.\n\nIf I were to use AA miles for the way back, what airlines can I book tickets with? Cathay, Qatar, and JAL? I found a JAL RT for 70k + $123, but idk if I'd be able to book that with AA miles. Thanks again."", ""For getting to Asia your best options with aa will be jal or cx. I don't think you can do qatar due to aa routing rules. You could also do an aa flight but id definitely prefer jal or cx over aa metal. Round trip on aa should be 70k and some fees/taxes. If you want to fly together you will need to do two one ways (should be 35k each). Once you are in Asia you should be able to use the 50k avios you have to hop around. They are great for shorter direct flights. Then have your return booked by transferring mr to sq.\n\nThere are many great guides about how to redeem miles.

212,Frustrated by Amtrak Guest Rewards,8,4k2ioj,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/4k2ioj/frustrated_by_amtrak_guest_rewards/,3,1463694294.0,"Ever since Chase lost Amtrak as a UR transfer partner (coinciding with Amtrak switching to a revenue-based rather than zone-based award system), I've really been missing the ability to take quick trips from NYC to DC, PHL, or BOS using my points.

I'm considering signing up for the two Bank of America cards which offer 20,000 and 12,000 Amtrak points respectively, but I'm concerned about how Amtrak has redeveloped its award program.

They advertise 'no blackout dates', but this seems to be a false promise. For example, when looking for a train from NY Penn to Washington, DC on 9/2, which is admittedly around Labor Day (peak travel period), there are tons of redemptions that are listed as 'No Price', meaning no award availability: http://i.imgur.com/JI9hwwV.jpg They are not sold out, however, plenty of revenue fares are still available: http://i.imgur.com/cOmd2VK.jpg

I was under the impression that one of the points [no pun intended] of a revenue-based frequent rider program (like JetBlue and Southwest) is that as long as there is a seat available on the flight, you can book it with points, it's just that peak period and expensive revenue tickets will cost more points. Seeing dates four months away with 'no availability' on a revenue-based frequent rider program seems ridiculous to me.

For the 'No Price' redemptions, Amtrak says:

>""No Price"" is displayed for Redemption Booking
>
>During peak travel periods when demand is high and capacity is limited, some departures are available at a higher point cost and some seats or classes of service may not be available for redemption. Amtrak Guest Rewards members with Select Plus(SM) and Select Executive status may find expanded access to use their points for travel during those peak times. For best results, we recommend members log in to their Amtrak Guest Rewards account before searching for available itineraries.

So it seems that they are blacking out certain trains for non-elite members, which is ridiculous on a revenue-based frequent rider program. If I want to spend more points for a more expensive ticket, what's the problem?

(cross-posted from FlyerTalk)","['That definitely sounds like false advertising. Have you tried booking over phone? Maybe an agent can override.', ""> If I want to spend more points for a more expensive ticket, what's the problem?\n\nQuite obvious, They'd rather force you to pay with real money since they are going to sell out on all the tickets anyway."", ""That's a shitty way to run a revenue based frequent flyer program. One of the only upsides of revenue based frequent flyer programs is the assurance that you can get any seat with points. But I guess since Amtrak has a monopoly, they can do whatever the fuck they want and not worry about people taking their business elsewhere.""]"

218,Help with BOS-->KTM booking please,0,5yr27h,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/5yr27h/help_with_bosktm_booking_please/,1,1489237110.0,"I'm planning a trip to Nepal / Bhutan for myself, my wife and two young children. We are looking to minimize stops and flight duration on account of the kids. One child I need to buy a ticket for the other is a lap infant.

BOS --> KTM
Dates: 10/3 - 10/20 (+/- a few days) 
Needs: 2 tickets (my wife, my 2 year old, and a lap infant, but my ticket will be reimbursed by work)  
Class: economy 
The Bhutan Ticket will be purchased as a separate RT ticket KTM--Paro 

I like the BOS--KTM Emirates flight and the BOS--KTM Qatar airlines flight. 

This is what I have: 
320,000 UR Points 
50,000 American miles 
75,000 Delta skypesos
10,000 JetBlue miles 
(62,000 United miles - but need to pay $250 to get them reinstated, as an aside is this worth it ?) 

I am not in need of using points for these Nepal flights but maximizing the value of my UR points is a priority. so if that means buying these Nepal tickets no problem and using UR points through the portal at a later time - that's fine. 

To me the best options by itinerary are these one stop options:
1.) Emirates (short layover in Dubai, PP lounge) 
2.) Qatar (long layover in Doha, would require a hotel) 

Emirates doesn't appear in the chase portal and Qatar airlines does but not a good itinerary (longer layover). 

Questions:

If I purchase Emirates or Qatar airlines can i earn miles in a partner that's useful to me ? Or are miles earned at such a low rate it's not worth considering ? 

**Is there some transfer of miles I'm missing that would allow me to purchase the Emirates or Qatar ticket at a rate better than the standard Chase UR discount ? **

Thanks so much for reading!! Any tips are welcome. 


","[""I see cash fares on Emirates BOS-DXB-KTM for $4100 total for 2 adults, 1 kid and 1 lap infant on the Emirates site for 10/3 to 10/20. If you do 10/2 to 10/22 then it's down to $4000. You should be able to call the Chase UR portal line and book these with UR. Assuming you have the CSR your points are worth 1.5cpp so it would cost 273k UR. Interestingly, the DXB-KTM-DXB legs are in First class on FlyDubai so along with enjoying first class for 5 hours each way, you would also have access to their lounge at DXB for your 5 hour layover outbound and maybe your 6.5 hour layover inbound (not sure if they allow lounge access post flight). I believe you'd earn 3.5k Alaska miles per person as well.\n\nThe other slightly cheaper option is to transfer your UR to United and/or reinstate your United miles to book BOS-IST-KTM on Turkish or a 2 stop flight on SWISS/Air India. Availability is a bit tougher especially with the Turkish flight. This would cost 255k UR/UA so a bit cheaper than Emirates through the UR portal.\n\nRegarding your United miles, regardless of whether or not you use them for this trip, I would say it is worth paying $250 to have them reinstated. 60k miles is enough for a r/t flight to Europe or 2 r/t domestic flights among other things.""]"

This is a semi-award/semi-churning post but I figured the main question belongs here. Goal is to take the SO on a trip to San Juan. We'll be leaving from NYC and want to know what the best way to get there via points is. 

Based on my research so far, I'm thinking either Jetblue or AA is our best bet for non-stop flights (which would be ideal). With Jetblue's program we would pay about 44000pts+fees for 2xroundtrip in mid july whereas for AA (booked with avios) we would pay 40000+fees. Our dates are pretty flexible; anytime in July but only July. The nice thing about Jetblue is that if there is a seat available, you can get it whereas there aren't many award seats left on AA. 

Assuming I can meet the minspend in the 1st month, should I go for Amex PRG and transfer pts to jetblue or maybe go for the chase BA and book thru avios? What is award availability for SJU routes on AA/BA like in the summer? Any other thoughts on award travel JFK-SJU?

I currently have the following cards:

Chase SWA with 35000pts

Barclays A+ working towards min spend

Citi AA plat select just approved 


I have kinda earmarked the AA points for a different trip so I wanted to add one more card as I mentioned above (obviously what I have now wouldn't get me too far).","[""NYC-SJU for summer should really only cost ~$350-400 per head on a revenue flight. You could perhaps just use the Barclay to pay for the tickets. You could buy them for ~$700 as part of the min spend. Then, you could apply the bonus miles for the statement credit to the charges. \n\nAA will be 35,000 miles per person r/t. There is some saver level award space in July JFK-SJU direct. 70k total is a lot.\n\nSince there is Saver availability, you could use BA Avios on those same fares for a lot less. 10k each way, so 40k r/t. This is probably the best option. \n\nI'd suggest BA Avios.\n\nAA Saver (for two) is available on the following days in July right now:\n\n* JFK-SJU: 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 17, 21\n* SJU-JFK: 8, 10, 16, 20, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31\n"", ""As far as the arrival SC goes, that's still $400ish that I'm on the hook for (that I'd rather avoid). Even though I might get better value on different routes using avios, the fact that I can get vacation flights for 2 and have pts left over for a short roundtrip fare somewhere on AA makes it worth it. Now I just need to determine if I can get the card, meet the spend and book before the availability dries up."", 'Thank you for the response and for taking the time to look up the saver availability too!', ""If you're talking about the Citi AA card, the bonus will post as your statement that you cross the spend threshold closes. So at minimum, you get the card, make the $2-3k spend (depending on your offer) within the first statement period, and then it will post the miles at the same time that statement posts. You may have luck asking Citi to move your statement date forward, if you need the miles in a crunch. \n\nAlternatively, could you use the Barclay to book one of the two tickets? Then you're only on the hook for 1 saver seat, which is easier to find than 2. \n\nedit: extra info"", ""Hmm that's a good thought too. I think what I will do is apply for the Chase BA, meet the spend, get the points and hopefully there is some award availability for my needs. I'll monitor the AA availability the whole time and if it ever goes down to 2 seats I'll just activate your plan. I think I could get a lot better value though if everything works out and I can use avios. ""]"

I've researched for hours and still am not 100% sure the optimal way to spend my UR points and other miles to get from California to Costa Rica and then to Peru.  I have ~200K UR points, 50K US Airlines miles, ~100K southwest. 
 
My plan is for myself and my SO to fly into SJO around 3/17/15, stay a week to attend a wedding, then fly to LIM for another couple of weeks.  

So far my research suggests that getting ourselves from SMF, or SFO to PHX which is a ""sweet spot"" for using Avois miles and then being able to book for 12.5K Avois miles, but I'm having difficulty actually figuring out if this actually will work, and the SJO-LIM seems to be the hiccup.  I used this as a guide: http://travelisfree.com/2013/06/18/best-use-ba-avios/

I'm also considering that maybe United is the way to go as the Star Alliance Route Map shows SFO-LIM stopping at SJO after routing through Chicago, and LAX-LIM through SJO.  Does anyone have any input or experience with this or a similar plan? Thanks for any input. 

**TL:DR**

* 200K UR points, various other SW, US and JetBlue points.
* Flying from CA (SMF, SFO, LAX?) to LIM (or other Peruvian airport)
* Stopover in Costa Rica for a week (SJO or LIB) 
* Timeframe: Middle of March
* Current Plan: Either SMF to PHX and Avois miles from there or Star Alliance flight with Stop Over in SJO (~40K miles) 

","[""I think doing a round-trip Star Alliance flight with a stopover in SJO is the way to go here.  It's going to be easier to find availability and you're going to end up with a cleaner itinerary.  \n\nIf you were based in PHX, you would probably come out ahead by taking advantage of the two sweet spots that exist in this itinerary.  PHX to SJO on Avios and the Star Alliance 10k one way flights between Central America/N. South Am/Carribean.  Where you hit a snag here is that Avios can't connect you from SJO to LIM because you are at the mercy of LAN/TAM which don't serve SJO or LIR.  Meanwhile Avianca and Copa have service between the two, albeit with connections usually in Columbia or Panama.  \n""]"
