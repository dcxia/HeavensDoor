15,JetBlue Gateway Select Assessment help,2,af1w4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/af1w4t/jetblue_gateway_select_assessment_help/,82,1547281134.0,"Hello everyone,  
I have applied to the Gateway Select program for JetBlue and have been selected to take their assessment. This is directed to those that have completed the program, are in the program currently, or have taken the test itself.  What exactly can I expect from the assessment?  Is it more aviation related or is it more general education related (like ACT/SAT.) I have done a lot of research on the program itself and for me the costs are not going to be (that) much of an issue. But I want to ensure that I do well on this assessment.  If anyone has any information for me (or even some practice tests that I could take) that would be absolutely fantastic and very much appreciated!  Thank you so much in advance.  
\*I will be checking regularly and responding to comments quickly\*

Edit: post was locked and archived so I will be moving this thread to  r/jetblue if you have any questions or just want to talk head there!","['Don\'t listen to those that say stuff like ""don\'t pay more money for a name"" blah blah blah. I was accepted into the JetBlue Gateway Select program and start on Feb. 4th. The assessment is mainly basic information that the regular person should know about airplanes.\n There is a segment where you have to control a simulated plane while multitasking on various objects on a map, or pressing a button when you hear a bell sound while listening to ATC callouts.\n There is a personality assessment to make sure you\'re not a sociopath or suicidal\n There are questions ranging from easy to hard about simple calculations (e.g how long is the trip from point A to B if the plane is going 20 mph and the distance is 50 miles away) and the hardest question (IMO) was something relating to the hourly fuel burn of the aircraft after so many minutes of full throttle. \n\nYou don\'t receive your score results, you just hear back in the form of an email saying whether or not you go to the next stage of the process. Hope this helps. \n', 'This comes up every now and then. \n\nWhy would you spend that much money and limit yourself to JetBlue?  \n\nIt’s not like you need that pathway to get hired there. Spend less money, and have every other airline in the country as an option as well. ', 'In the same boat here. Did my phone interview on 2/22. Looks like in the past people knew exactly when emails are going out etc. I’ll update if I hear. ', 'Got an email on Friday saying they will get back soon', 'Same here', 'Anything yet ?', 'How long does it take to hear back after the assessment? Took mine today so I’m curious to see how long it’ll take compared to AA cadet academy. Thanks!', 'heard back yesterday that i am getting phone interview... does anyone know what questions are asked... this would help.', 'You gotten any word yet', 'Hey! I’m trying to gather info and see if anyone has heard about when we’ll hear back. I did my in-person the earlier this month. Thanks!', 'Thanks a bunch!', 'Anyone know when we find out', 'This waiting is the hardest part', 'Awesome thank you!', '[deleted]', 'Okay I have family ties to JetBlue and have ins but that is not the only reason. I like JetBlue and hate delta/Skywest.\n\nBut because you are so worried about cost let’s break it down.  Currently the average is anywhere between $40,000-$60,000 to earn your Commercial Pilot’s license. Let’s say worse case scenario I end up spending close to $60,000 for the Commercial License. If I go through a university for flight training that is 4 years until I have the license. \n\nSo I have spent $60,000 on tuition costs for it. But this is not including.  Housing/rent and utilities or other costs that might come up. Yeah of course it varies from state to state but where I live average rent cost is $1000 a month totaled up for 4 years because of my schooling and that is $48000. Add that to the tuition for the commercial is $108,000 total for the 4 years.\n\nNow why am I calculating rent into this? Well that’s because JetBlue’s program includes housing as well in their program. Currently JetBlue says the full cost of the program is $110,000 for the 3.5 years they say the program will take.  Plus all the benefits of transportation, books, test costs, etc. Currently you will be spending your time training in Mesa, AZ quick search and average for a 2 bedroom apartment (which I need and what JetBlue is giving you) is around $1000. Same as what I would pay where I am living.\n\nSo we now have the totals of $108,000 without the program and $110,000 with the program. To me $2,000 is not that big of a difference and with JetBlue I get out into the field a half year earlier with a job guaranteed.  Oh did I mention that they want you to have your Commercial License after a year in the program and the remaining two and a half you work as a flight instructor and then training for your ATP? Seems like a pretty good program to me. Cause if I went through my schooling at a university I would have my Commercial after 4 years and then have to find a job to get my hours to 1,500. So idk doesn’t seem like I am paying all that much money for a guaranteed job.\n\nOh also it’s a guaranteed job at JetBlue but I don’t have to take it. I would still have a choice with whatever airline I want as well. ', 'Nothing.', '[deleted]', '3 weeks. How long did it take for you hear back from AA after the video interview?', 'Questions about schooling, work experience, flight experience (if any),  service experience, as well as what inspires you', 'Nope still waiting', 'They mentioned to us on our interview date that it would be after they did all interviews and more thank likely the first or second week of June', 'Any news from JetBlue yet? I am currently in the program and would like to hear from all of you!', 'Sometime in the first two weeks of June is what I was told', 'Have you heard anything?', ""I was accepted as well. US Credit is great as far as letting you know right away if you qualify and then making it easy if you do qualify. It's basically completely hands-off - you sign one paper and then they handle everything as far as paying for your training. It's also definitely easier to qualify than with Wells Fargo, who is the other option provided by JetBlue. WF wanted a co-signer for me but US Credit didn't. I'm sure you can get your own lender as well but those are the two JB recommends, and who deal with JB and CAE directly. If you get your own lender, from CAE's perspective they're going to just bill you as if you have no financial aid, whereas US Credit, at least, sends CAE the money for you directly.\n\nThe downsides are that the interest rate isn't great, and it's variable. Everyone in my class is a little confused about how much we're really going to have to pay back. My promissory note said $170k over 10 years. That sounds crazy, but remember that \\*any\\* loan is going to be like that. If you take out a $100k loan, you're not paying back $100k. Lenders aren't charities; there's always compounded interest. The financial aspect is definitely one drawback to this program, but the reason you pay that money is for the speed. Nothing's even going to come close to getting you flying for a major airline quicker (I checked) and those extra years of salary and seniority-building at the beginning more than make up for the extra cost."", ""Curious why you combine Delta/SkyWest.

But it'll be free."", 'Been here for a while now...', 'Yeah, still waiting', 'Going great!', ""That's fair. Though customer service issues happen at every airline. It's not hard to find somebody who has had terrible experience with United, American, JetBlue, Southwest, etc. It's also not hard to find people who love those companies either. The reality is customer service is severely lacking across the airline industry in the US. I personally wouldn't choose my place of employment based on that.\n\nAs far as SkyWest is concerned, it is what it is. Things are decent right now, but I also wish the company did certain things differently. Being non-union also sucks a whole lot, but we are trying to change that. That being said, every regional has its pros and cons, and none of them are really all that better(with a few noteable exceptions), so take that for what its worth."", 'I took the assessment over 3 weeks ago and haven\'t gotten anything more than an email basically saying ""Compiling Results, Stand By.""

Hopefully you will receive something soon, we are all excited to see who the new class contains', 'Nope', 'Some about schooling, work experience, service experience, and your inspiration are the main questions. Super easy', 'Awesome thank you!', 'Oh nice how many of you are here?', 'Waiting for what?', ""It took me quite a while to hear back from JetBlue at every stage. You have to remember that they are basically deciding whether or not to hire you as a pilot without you even having any training or certifications, or even really any history of any kind that they can look at for guidance. So they're very deliberate.\n\nAA was quicker, funnily enough, but then AA is not offering you a job with their program - just a chance to train and then interview with a regional later. JetBlue is literally offering you a job right at the beginning. So it's big stakes for them and I'm sure they want to get it right."", 'Did you get an email for the face to face interview?', 'good luck !!!', 'You are under the umbrella of CAE for 3 years.', 'I will let you know!', 'Anybody hear anything more after the interviews and initial ""we\'ll get back to you"" email?', 'Umm, who are you?

Found out about gateway select earlier this year, couldn't find much info on the process as I researched (found two helpful posts on r/flightsim and r/flying). Obvi it started in 2016 so there isn't much info to be found other then what's on the web page (http://pilots.jetblue.com/gateway-select/training). 

Submitted my application, resume, and cover letter Sept 24 2017.
Received an email on Oct 4 stating I've been selected for the next round of the application process.
This involved signing up for a $160 aptitude test at a testing center and to have the test completed by Oct 15. Just returned from that test and decided to make this post as I went in to it blind. You've got three hours and 4 test segments:

1. Multitasking: watch and interact with a flight sim, with limited direction on what the test comprises of. Keep track of audio directions (and how many individuals give you those directions), keep track of how many times there is a chiming noise, keep track of how many times a red light turns on. You also will have to click a button everytime you see air traffic or pass over a waypoint (you will be asked at what point you saw the helicopters and what the last way point looked like). While all this is happening you use the up and down arrows in a mini-game where you navigate a plane past oncoming rectangles. AND you have a few seconds to assess and answer quick math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition questions. The Sim ends and you answer the questions about how many chimes and how many people, what the last check point looked like, how many aircraft you saw, where in the route was the airfield, what the cockpit looked like and where the guages were. You make an assesment of how hard all that was and rate yourself on how well you did. Then you do the sim again. Slightly different, except this time you know what you're looking for.

2. Math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition:
Worst math was an algebra question (something like, (y-12)÷14=9). Spacial reasoning and pattern recognition are timed events, gotta be quick to answer or it counts as wrong.

3. Reacting to confrontation:
Questions like ""you see a couple arguing, the woman is trying to get away but the man has a hold of her arm and keeps pulling her back. Do you A B C or D?"" All the questions were how you'd react in a confrontation either involving you or getting involved with others.

4. Personality test:
Basic personality test. Questions like ""I work well with others."" ""Individual performance is more important then group success."" Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree.

The test results come back same day via email.

Next up will be a phone interview if they like the test results.
After that is an in person interview.

Will post as I move thru the process. 
This is an informative post about the process; discussions on program details and cost exist on other threads. Have not seen anything detailing NDA on what the test is made of. Dm me if this violates any policy that may jepordise my applicant eligibility.

Current LiPo batteries are usually around 100-200 Wh/kg, compared to gasoline or aviation fuel which are closer to 10,000 Wh/kg. So yeah, batteries at this point are pretty limited.\n\nHere's a [Pipistrel Alpha Electro](http://www.pipistrel.si/plane/alpha-electro/overview) which can stay up 60 minutes with a 30 minute reserve. The battery system weighs 126 kg, but the electric motor only weighs 11 kg compared to 64kg for a Rotax 912 of similar power. The batteries hold about 113 Wh/kg.\n\nBut battery tech advances apace, and 400-500 Wh/kg batteries will be available within a year or two. You can already get [evaluation samples with 300 Wh/kg](https://oxisenergy.com/products/).\n\nOnce you have your props running with electric motors, you can use anything to supply the electricity. You can put a fossil fueled range extender engine in there to run a generator to charge the batteries in flight. Since it doesn't need to drive the propeller, it can be of a design that's lighter and more efficient in fuel use, like a [free piston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-piston_engine) [linear geneator](http://www.greencarcongress.com/2016/05/20160506-toyotafpeg.html), or a [turbine](http://gas2.org/2015/05/07/wrightspeed-micro-turbine-range-extender/).\n\nThen, even though you're still using fossil fuel to extend range, you still only need a fraction of what you would normally use, assuming batteries are recharged on the ground using non-fossil fuel energy.""]"

69,The TWA Flight Center was recently reopened as a hotel. But why the Pan Am Worldport was fed to wrecking ball instead of doing the same?,22,bry7z5,https://i.imgur.com/wGjXfLy.jpg,8,1558610404.0,,"[""Couple reasons.\n\n1) the WorldPort was not particularly architecturally significant. It was a circular building with a large roof. (I've been there; I'm not saying this as someone who's only seen pictures.) Inside, it was just an old, worn out terminal. It felt more like a bus station by modern standards. The TWA Flight Center was and is an architectural jewel. \n\n2) The WorldPort was falling apart at the end. There were nets all over the roof just to keep the plaster from falling on passengers because of the constant leaks. The TWA Flight Center always seemed in better condition. I flew out of it in 2000 and visited it several times when it was open to the public in the years since; it never seemed like it was in a state of disrepair, even well after TWA was gone and the terminal vacant. The WorldPort seemed in a state of disrepair even while Delta was still actively using it.\n\n3) Delta wanted the space. And as the owner of the terminal, they're entitled to it. Consider us lucky that JetBlue had domain over T5; for quite a while, they planned on incorporating it into their own new terminal. That never happened, but while the Flight Center was still technically in limbo, JetBlue acted as a kind of shield and protector for it. Eventually JetBlue lost interest, and they never really needed it since they were able to build their new terminal beyond it, but by then others had taken up the mantle of protecting the Flight Center. If you see the geography of JFK Airport, I'm not sure how you'd have gone about building a terminal beyond the WorldPort while keeping it standing. Taxiway A butts up right against it, and even if you were to tear down the modern secondary concourse beyond the main WorldPort while leaving the original building, that wouldn't leave enough room to build a whole new terminal.\n\nNow, you can definitely criticize Delta for what they've done with that space since, which is pretty much nothing. But I don't know what their actual plans are. I know they have some, though. They didn't plan on tearing that building down and just leaving a bunch of empty pavement. But given how run down the original building was, I'm also sure they're saving a bunch of money by not having to maintain it.\n\nIt's sad, but pretty logical."", 'Two words, one name: Eero Saarinen. The man is a goddam legend and has become a major namesake in our collective architectural heritage', 'Because it was in the way', ""Having read through all of this, I just hope they get to build a Pan Am themed hotel or museum somewhere. The TWA Hotel is a brilliant throwback to the golden age of air travel, I just hope there's some tribute atleast to arguably the most iconic carrier in aviation, apart from a cancelled TV show or failed attempts to revive it"", 'Not exactly nothing, they gained a ton of hardstands which are very useful.', 'Of what? Can you explain the backstory? I just know it was a Delta terminal after Pan Am stopped operations and before it was demolished.', ""I've seen their master plan, and I've forgotten most of the details but I seem to remember that they do plan on tearing down T2 at some point, which will leave a vast, cavernous space to build another terminal. Then they may be moving out of T4. I could be making that last part up, but I do know they have plans to build something where T3/WorldPort originally was, and T2 has long outlived its useful lifespan."", ""Current expansion plan is for T1 to expand through T2 into T3 area. It will then be linked to T4. But basically new T1 will be a massive terminal covering the space from T1-T3. \n\nAlso, spot on the points about the worldport - summed up the decision to tear it down quite well. If you get the chance, the new TWA Hotel complex is pretty cool. They're still getting it up and running, but it's sweet to walk through.""]"

Since that flight, the airline (and others) have adopted procedures to land ASAP if any smoke enters the cockpit... not because the smoke is dangerous per se, but because it may get worse, as it did with SWR111; by the time they were starting the fuel dump they'd lost a lot of their displays and electrics.

The autopilot isn't calibrated entirely for situations where not all the flight controls would respond as expected, so if the autopilot was flying then oscilations might have ensued as the autopilot would be one step behind the control of the aircraft - e.g, the autopilot is trying to fly a track and commands a left roll, but the roll is less than expected so it commands some more, then tries to roll out onto the selected track but flight controls respond less quickly so it rolls past the track and has to roll right, etc... \n\n It's also possible that the same effect occurred during manual flight, with the pilots over-controlling the plane (which is easy to do if it feels like it isn't responding). \n\n However, it's equally possible that the reports of swinging are completely made up by the passengers, that it was normal movement but they were scared shitless and thought they were going to crash...

I had a very unusual experience last month flying Alaska Airlines, and my girlfriend had the same experience with JetBlue today.

So we were flying from BOS -> SJC on Alaska, on an A320-200 on a very very cold Sunday evening. We were told that we had a totally full flight and that due to the weight, cold temperatures, and high winds, we needed to stop in Detroit to refuel the plane. We ended up getting canceled, sleeping in the terminal, and taking a Delta flight back. Alaska compensated us nicely but still...this is a new one for me - I've flown many transcontinental trips over the last ten years and haven't had the unplanned stop experience. 

Just today, my girlfriend is flying back from JFK -> SJC on JetBlue, on an A320-200, and had a similar experience, she was told due to high winds. Her flight has to stop in PHX to refuel. 

I was under the impression that for the A320ceo, a transcontinental hop was well within its operating range of 3200 miles. I've never had this experience or heard of others having to stop to get fuel. 

Am I crazy?  Is this normal? Is this just due to weather and unusual high altitude winds? I think I'm well versed on airline/airplane topics but I am not in the industry. Can someone offer insight? 

Thanks","['It is the winds at altitude, normally the 320 can make it clear across the country, but when the winds are whipping at altitude they just can’t do it the whole way with proper reserve fuel. The weather on the west coast may add to it as well. If they were required to have an alternate airport then required to have More fuel on the plane as well. Hopefully with the 320neos coming out this won’t happen so often. ', ""If you're at the max takeoff weight and have a 150mph headwind, you're going to burn a lot of extra fuel."", 'Could be the winds but at my airline we twll PAX that we have to make a quick tech stop to refuel and then will continue on to our destination but we actually are offloading cargo. ', ""The problem with the A320 is that it's being put on routes that really wasn't designed to do. The big transcons - NY/Boston to SF/SJ/LA were traditionally run with 767's and 757's that had plenty of fuel, range and performance.\n\nWe're making the same flights now that we did 20 years ago with 737NG's and A320's and full load with calm winds is basically the limit of their capability. Any headwinds/weather deviations/etc will result in irregular operations like you've experienced.\n\n3200 miles is accurate  on a full load WITH sharklets and calm winds. I don't believe B6 ordered them that way and are still using the fence.  Very frequently we do not fly point to point and deviations/routing for a transcon flight can add 100 miles. To wit. AA1 - direct point to point is 2472 miles. The actual/planned flight is around 100 miles further "", 'Hahahahaha Jesus ', 'If they knew they had to make a technical stop no matter what, they could take extra revenue cargo to pay for the detour and make it more worthwhile.

So I decided to break these down by merger/origins:\n\n**American**\n\nAZ dominance is originally from America West's PHX hub, later US Airways.\n\nPA dominance is due to the PHL hub, originally from Allegheny, which renamed to USAir and finally US Airways.\n\nNC is due to CLT, originally from Piedmont, later USAir and US Airways.\n\nTX and FL are due to DFW and MIA hubs, respectively, both of which were homegrown by AA (not acquired via merger).  AR is simply well-connected to DFW.\n\n**Southwest**\n\nPretty much all of them were homegrown from Southwest over time.  The exception is WI.  At the merger, AirTran was the biggest airline at MKE.  Southwest eliminated some flights but it's still enough to be number one in Wisconsin.\n\n**Delta**\n\nUT is due to the SLC hub, originally Western Airlines.\n\nMN and MI are due to MSP and DTW hubs, which were Northwest hubs at the time of merger.  North Central and later Republic also had hubs at those airports.  They merged into NWA in 1986.  IA, ND, and MT are well-connected to MSP so those also come from NWA.\n\nNY is due to hubs at JFK and LGA.  These are a sort of hodgepodge.  DL is big at JFK due to acquiring the former transatlantic route authorities from Pan Am.  Much of LGA comes via a 1972 merger with Northeast Airlines, although Delta has always been a big player connecting the Southeast with NYC.  Lots of routes also came from NWA or were homegrown in the past ten years.\n\nKY is homegrown by Delta due to the CVG hub (which is in Kentucky, not Ohio).  GA is, of course, due to ATL, which has been a huge Delta hub for ages.  MS, AL, and SC are well-connected to ATL.\n\n**United**\n\nHomegrown:  CO is due to DEN and IL is due to ORD.  WY is well-connected to DEN, and SD is well-connected to both DEN and ORD.\n\nVA is due to the IAD hub, which came about due to a 1961 merger with Capital Airlines.  Capital was actually hubbed at DCA, but IAD did not exist yet.  UA shifted the hub to IAD once DCA perimeter restrictions came into effect, etc.  WV is well-connected to IAD.\n\nNJ is due to EWR, which comes from the Continental merger, which itself came from a People Express merger in 1987.  VT and ME are well-connected to EWR.\n"", '###r/mapporn\n\n---------------------------------------------\n^(For mobile and non-RES users) ^| \n[^(More info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/botwatch/comments/6xrrvh/clickablelinkbot_info/) ^| \n^(-1 to Remove) ^| \n[^(Ignore Sub)](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClickableLinkBot/comments/6xrtxg/ignore_list/)', ""Wonder if Alaska will ever dominate California, seeing that with their acquisition of Virgin America, they're trying to be California's hometown airline."", ""It'd be pretty interesting to see the changes to this map over many decades with mergers, deregulation and now-defunct airlines."", 'Why so much business for Southwest?\n\nBetween their (I think old) policy of first come on the seating assignments, and their lack of presence on Kayak and such, and prices that seemed typical of the industry, I haven’t really paid much attention to them. \n\nI’m not trash posting them, just interested in why people are loyal to them.

173,I don’t get the vitriol with the Airbus vs. Boeing fanboys,7,8xbir7,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/8xbir7/i_dont_get_the_vitriol_with_the_airbus_vs_boeing/,5,1531171207.0,"I wasn’t into aircraft my whole life and since being a frequent flyer, I have gotten a lot more into aviation and the airline industry.  I watch videos, read publications, listen to podcasts, etc. about the subject and have also started with flight simulators.  One thing I have noticed with the aviation nerd community is the extremely impassioned opinions regarding Airbus vs. Boeing, like it would make you think you were reading a debate on the Israel-Palestine conflict or something.

Most of the comments I read are also totally without merit.  I watch a YouTube video to learn about the 737 Max and half the comments are like unsubstantiated one-liners like “The a320 neo is hands-down better” and “if it ain’t Boeing, I ain’t going” and so forth.  Most people seem to comment based exclusively on which they think looks better, or which airline configures the seats in the cabin better, or rarely something like “the 737 climbs better and has a higher service ceiling”, but ultimately, what do these things even matter?  It isn’t a military interceptor.  The planes are both widely popular, similarly reliable, do the same job, and the 737NG has basically the identical fatalities per departures as the a320.  From a passenger’s point of view, the negligible preferences don’t seem to warrant all the hatred.  I have been on wonderful, spacious 737’s operated by Southwest but also shitty crammed ones operated by other carriers.  JetBlue has a very spacious a320, but US Airways was not as nice.

I would be more interested in what the airlines actually think and how they figure one serves their operations better, or what pilots think, and I see pilots who are big fans of both.  I imagine that the planes are so operationally similar that even things like geopolitics play a bigger role sometimes than economics, like Poland’s LOT going with the 787 and bucking the European solidarity with Airbus and the animosity Poland and the EU have right now.

Then there are interesting situations where an airline will fly both, either because of a merger or other circumstances like Aeroflot not wanting to be too dependent on any foreign manufacturer.  The arrival of the MC-21 in a few years will be very interesting too.

Is there a good reason to feel particularly loyal of one aircraft manufacturer than the other?  I even own shares in Boeing and I don’t particularly care if I have to travel on an Airbus.  Aside from the seats being more cramped than the Republic E-jet I was connecting on, the Air France a380 was such a wonderful flight!","['Well, there are many factors to this argument.  For some of us, it\'s the veritable Hatfield v. McCoy argument.  My dad was a (Ford|Chevy|Boeing) guy, so I\'m one!  Three generations down the road Old Boy has no idea WHY ""if it ain\'t Boeing, I ain\'t going"", but it sounds neat and it identifies with my friends, so yolo.\n\nFor the passengers, they literally by and large could not care less.  They care if it:\n\nA. Is comfortable\n\nB. Is reliable\n\nc: Is safe \n\nAll major manufacturers certainly meet B and C and whatever parts of A they can influence (atmosphere inside the airplane basically), but the rest of A is in the airline\'s hands.\n\nFor operators, the argument comes down to money.  The purchase or lease of commercial jets is a complicated process of moving cheese and imaginary and real numbers.  This is an illustration of how capitalism is good.  Airbus and Boeing are in the business of selling airplanes, and at the moment business is good, but it might not always be that way.  To ensure future orders, a manufacturer might cut a great deal on a current order.  Also for consideration is dispatch reliability, cost of maintenance, cost of training, availability of parts and support, direct operating costs, and performance are just a few.', 'They\'re both massive, complex international corporations so it doesn\'t really make sense to be a loyal fan. But I can\'t stomach Airbus for 1 reason: the name. It\'s the worst. I couldn\'t think of a more bland, unimaginative, unappealing, dry, strictly functional name if I tried. I remember [this scene from the founder](https://youtu.be/7FxHY-vLMgs?t=1m15s), and I think it applies to ""Boeing"" while it\'s a complete opposite description of ""Airbus."" Boeing could be anything you want it to be, it\'s limitless, wide open, while Airbus is... a bus. In the air. You fly a Boeing if you want to get going. You fly Airbus if you need to take a bus.

178,National Training Aircraft Symposium Tackles Pilot Shortage and Critical Aviation Industry Issues,0,9817vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/9817vz/national_training_aircraft_symposium_tackles/,1,1534531299.0,"A worldwide pilot shortage and new, innovative ways to enhance [aviation](http://www.aeroavians.com/) training are key discussions this week in Daytona Beach, Fla. at the 2018 National Training Aircraft Symposium: The Changing Role of the Pilot, hosted by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

The conference features presentations and keynotes speakers from NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, Delta Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Piedmont Airlines, the Aviation Technician Education Council, the Air Line Pilots Association and the U.S. Air Force, among others.

Attendees from the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands are participating as subject experts, including leaders in the aviation industry and from Embry-Riddle and other universities. Emerging topics focus on the accelerating demand for more pilots and mechanics, the introduction of new technology in aviation, the training and implications of personal air vehicles and unmanned aircraft systems and educating students at a younger age in aviation-related fields.

Embry-Riddle President P. Barry Butler, Ph.D., told the audience he was pleased to see symposium topics expanded to include aviation maintenance as well as autonomous vehicles and cyber security. His opening remarks also mentioned a number of programs at Embry-Riddle that are helping to address key issues such as pilot demand, including Embry-Riddle’s Daytona Beach and Prescott campuses partnership in the new Delta Propel Pilot Career Path Program, to identify, select and develop the next generation of pilots.

A 2017 Boeing study estimated that more than 600,000 commercial airline pilots will be needed globally over the next two decades.

In addition to Delta and other airlines, JetBlue Airways is working on creative approaches to pilot sourcing, including partnerships with universities such as Embry-Riddle, to help feed the pipeline, according to Nancy Shane, Ph.D., who has a master’s degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry-Riddle, and is manager of Pilot Gateway Programs at JetBlue.

Representatives from the Air Line Pilots Association also discussed education outreach programs providing guidance to pilots seeking employment and mentoring assistance.

New pilot training models such as mixed reality, augmented reality and virtual reality was featured topics on the first day of the conference.

Lulu Sun, Ph.D., Embry-Riddle associate professor of Engineering, presented “Exploring the Best Practices of Virtual Training Delivery for the Prospective Air Traffic Controllers.” Stephanie Fussell, an Embry-Riddle doctorate student in Aviation discussed “Implementing Immersive Virtual Reality in an Aviation/Aerospace Teaching and Learning Paradigm,” and William L. Little, aerospace technologist for software systems with NASA, talked about NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Augmented/Virtual Reality Lab.

Attendees also saw first-hand how augmented reality can be used, from seeing inside an actual aircraft engine to preflight training, as demonstrated by Lori Brown, associate professor and researcher from Western Michigan University, in her presentation, “Holographic Micro-simulations to Enhance Aviation Training with Mixed Reality.”

“Right now the airline industry is facing as much stress in the hiring domain as it has in years,” said Michael E. Wiggins, Ph.D., professor and department chair of Aeronautical Science for Embry-Riddle’s Daytona Beach Campus. “There is a big push to try to get flight students through the training faster, quicker, cheaper and more effective so that we can continue to safely operate the National Air Space System.”

Sure you can divide the annual total budget for the MTX department by the flight hours and come up with a number, however if the faculties and staff aren't operating at 100% capacity then adding another aircraft to their work load would hardly create any extra costs other than parts.

193,Virgin-Alaska and questions on Airline Branding,0,62jwtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/62jwtv/virginalaska_and_questions_on_airline_branding/,4,1490975852.0,"Hi all,

With the recent acquisition of Virgin America by Alaska Airlines in the United States, I came to wonder about some of the potential questions management and branding employees come to face in times of mergers and growth.

As it stands, Alaska seems to be taking over Virgin's route network as well as fleet (among others). The Virgin name will disappear, and Alaska will find itself in a very dominant position on the West coast. This is all fine and good, but I can't help but feel it being a bit silly for an airline situated throughout the West coast to call itself ""Alaska Airlines"". 

Geographic-based names and branding aren't uncommon of course, but they tend to be present in situations where a niche is being served and growth/competition aren't really present (think of Hawaiian, Air Seychelles, Air France, etc.). These brands tend to be able to get away with these names because of their niche, high-end, flag carrier status. More often than not, these airlines get subsidized by their respective governments anyway to allow for their operation.

Southwest is a definite exception here, but it can be argued that they really managed to distance themselves from the geographic name entirely by giving little focus to the Southwest U.S. at all. Many airlines like the startup low-cost long-haul ""Level"" from IAG chose for a name with no geographic ties to aid future growth, even though it will be based in Barcelona.

While Alaska Airlines has a strong brand in its area (which is more Seattle than it is Alaska anyway), I was wondering if it would be in order for a brand change? Picking up from where Virgin left off is a big task, and the trendy West doesn't really seem all too ready for their arrival. I'd figure a snazzier brand would be more in line with their low-cost aspirations. Not necessarily Virgin, but something a little similar.
I'm from the East coast, so thankfully I've still got my lovely JetBlue anyway.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Alaska Airlines should probably give itself a name/brand change to allow for a more smooth expansion along the West Coast. Agree/disagree?","['Alaska is a legacy carrier. The name stays. ', 'WestJet is free now...', ""Alaska isn't an LCC and they've been operating in the west coast for like 50 years, they don't need to try and win people over on the West coast.\n\nAnd as a PNW expat they're my go-to if they're operating the route I'm taking. High brand loyalty."", ""Good input! Didn't consider that, though does that remove the possibility of a change completely? \nI don't completely understand how the legacy status could heavily impact the ability to grow.""]"

There are really only 2, maybe 3 towers needed in the state right now, which are Honolulu, Maui, and either Kona.  The rest of the airports have mostly local traffic that don't really need towers, but whatever.  What they really need to do is open up John Rogers (the airport right next to HNL), but they will have to find an easy way to get people from there to Honolulu without waiting 3 hours in traffic.
