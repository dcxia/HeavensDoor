1,"JetBlue $69 fares all disappeared, but flights still have seats?",0,ceckwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ceckwm/jetblue_69_fares_all_disappeared_but_flights/,12,1563397542.0,"I've googled, but can't find the answer to this. Forgive me if this is something most people know; I've been poor all my life and am not used to using planes.

Yesterday I was looking for flights back home to Boston from DC for next week. I found several on JetBlue for $69, one flight leaving every hour or two. They weren't flagged as having only a few seats left, as some flights on other airlines were. Once I confirmed with the rest of my party that this arrangement worked, I went to buy the tickets, but now they're $166, and have been since last night. It's showing the same price and same flights on every aggregator site as well as on the JetBlue site.

What exactly happened here? Did they just happen to raise the price? Do they sell a certain number of $69 seats and then the rest are full price? I'm assuming I'm SOL and will be paying $166, but just wanting to know how JetBlue pricing works for future reference.","['Airfare changes daily. There are many factors , and each airline does things a little differently. Its not uncommon to see prices double depending the day', ""There are 'buckets' of seats with different prices. The $69 seats sold out, so now you're in the next 'bucket' of $166 seats."", ""FYI, for flight bookings that originate in the US, the Department of Transportation has a rule that allows you to cancel any booking within 24 hours for a full refund. So in the future, if you see a good deal then you can book the flights, and then get confirmation from the rest of your party after. If it doesn't work, then you can just cancel the tickets within 24 hours.\n\nThis also means it's worthwhile to always check the price again the day after you book. I saved $200 once after the price dropped the day after I booked a flight, so I bought it again at the $200 lower price and cancelled the original ticket for the full refund."", ""I don't know about JetBlue specifically, but usually airlines have different fare classes so it's likely that the $69 fares are all sold out, and you're left with the ones with the higher price."", 'OK, that was one of my suspicions. I didn\'t know about ""bucket"" so didn\'t find that in my searching. Thank you. \n\nAnd of course, in the 20 minutes since I\'ve written this post and responded to a work e-mail, I\'m now in a $188 bucket. Purchasing immediately. FML.', '[deleted]', ""Ha, yes that's stupid airline fares for you :') Cheers."", 'It\'s called ""booking classes"" or ""fare classes"". Each airline has their own, but essentially what they mean is that the same seat can cost vastly different amounts depending on where and when you book it, and what restrictions / additional services your ticket includes. \n\nAirlines try to fill up their planes, and make as much money as they can by doing so. They divide the seats in each cabin class (first, business, economy) into booking classes, for example a plane with 50 economy class seats could have 20 seats in class (Y) for $200, 20 seats in class (H) for $100 and 10 seats in class (T) for $50. These classes usually don\'t only differ in price, but also restrictions that apply. I.e. (Y) might be able to change flights for a small fee, while (H) has to pay a lot more for that and (T) is unable to do so. Other typical differences are baggage allowance, and frequent flyer miles, but there are also classes that just differ in price. The idea behind all of this is that the flight has to be attractive for both flexible price sensitive holiday travelers (looking for the heavily discounted ticket) filling up otherwise empty seats and business travelers (willing to spend more to arrive precisely when they have to and requiring flexible tickets) who make the airline money. \n\nIt\'s not a first come first serve system, the airline will successively open contingents in the different booking classes in a way that they hope makes them the most money. Additionally the entire system is also flexible, so they might shift seats between the classes and change prices for the classes (usually automatically nowadays). \n\nBottom line: The *currently available* contingent of the heavily discounted booking class for $69 was sold out. If sales fall behind projections, the airline might put another contingent of that class out again to make sure their plane doesn\'t fly half empty, but that\'s not a given. Maybe sales are going well, and they moved the remaining contingent of that booking class to more expensive classes. So gamble on your own risk, sometimes it\'s worth to wait for a while if prices go down again.', 'Fare buckets are a regular aspect of airline pricing.', ""Fare classes absolutely exist and are generally disclosed in your confirmation. That doesn't mean that *every* ticket in fare class O on a given plane sold for the exact same price necessarily, but fare class is a huge factor in pricing."", '[deleted]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lhn2z/nice_try_delta/cbzlr7r/', '[deleted]', 'It explains how fare classes (buckets) work.', '[deleted]', ""I was a commercial manager at an airline.

I booked a coach flight through Orbitz and it is 6 hour domestic flight. I'm not a frequent flyer at all, and the last time we flew was 2017 and we could see our seats when we booked, and we were automatically seated together since we bought or tickets in the same transaction. JetBlue seems to not reveal the seating until you get to the airport (?) unless you buy the ""more space"" seats for $95 each (no thanks). What is your experience in ensuring you sit with your spouse/partner/friend on a JetBlue coach flight without having to pay fees? Did they end up automatically sitting you together since your ticket numbers were consecutive?

Advice appreciated as air travel (and all that goes with it) makes me super anxious!","[""For airlines that don't include seat selection in the base ticket fare, they tend to try and put you together, but I have often ended up getting two middle seats. I would say about 2/3 of the time I end up sitting next to who I buy the ticket with though even without paying for seats. Checking in as early as possible seems to help with this since there are more seating options still.  \n \nIf you want to make sure you sit next to each other, make sure it is  included in your ticket or pay extra for seat selection."", 'I fly JetBlue a lot. There will be a seat for you on the plane as JetBlue does not overbook their flights, and they will not force you to buy an Even More Space seat in order to get on the plane.\n\nWhat will most likely happen is that between now and the time of your flight, someone who hasn\'t opted for the Even More Space seat will opt for that seat, freeing up their core coach seat for you; or if that doesn\'t happen, a JetBlue frequent flyer/high value customer will get upgraded to that seat and you will get their normal coach seats. It\'s very unlikely you will get the Even More Space seats without paying as an infrequent, no-status flyer.\n\nAs for asking people to change, you say you\'re not a frequent flyer so I will take you on your word that you\'re not trolling -- there\'s very much a ""hierarchy"" of desirable seating in which middle seats are absolutely inferior to window/aisle seats.\n\nMost people, including myself, will not be willing to switch from a ""superior"" window/aisle to an ""inferior"" middle unless there are real extenuating circumstances, i.e. parent with small infant child or adult traveling with very elderly or disabled parent, etc.\n\nIn the future, this is one of the reasons that it\'s always best to book a fare on an airline\'s own website. JetBlue is actually pretty good among domestic carriers in that it allows you to select a core seat for free even at the cheapest level, which American/Delta/United\'s Basic Economy does not allow you to do.', 'Not certain if you’re able to pull up your reservation on JetBlue’s website. There could be a place for seat selection within the reservation.

I’m wondering if the tickets were booked through a third party, it didn’t allow to choose your seats upon booking?

6,"Parents went to the wrong airport, but JetBlue took care of them and got them a new flight right away for no charge. Did they get lucky?",8,ahuu0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ahuu0t/parents_went_to_the_wrong_airport_but_jetblue/,9,1547992607.0,"My mother called me earlier tonight explaining this situation. For some reason she thought their flight to Orlando left from Boston around 8PM. I think she somehow mixed up this flight for a different one they had booked for my brother a few weeks before. They got to Logan really early, sometime between 4PM and 5PM, and when she pulled up their booking she realized their flight was actually from Hartford at around 6PM. It was too late at that point to make it to Hartford for that flight. They spoke to a woman at the JetBlue counter who was able to put them on a flight from Boston to Ft Lauderdale departing at 9:15PM, which they’re on right now as I’m writing this. They’ll have to drive a little further to get to where they’re staying, but I’m thinking that’s a small price to pay for a mistake like this. The agent had also put them on standby for an earlier flight to Orlando, their original destination, but there ended up being no room, so they took that later flight to FLL. JetBlue also re-booked the return flight into Boston as well.

I’m basically just wondering if this is standard procedure for airlines to do something like this? When she had first called me and was explaining what happened, my first thought was they were out all of the money for their original flight and return. I was pleasantly surprised to here otherwise.

Our most restricted fare:

* No refunds or changes

How do airlines like United Airlines, AA, JetBlue etc. prevent you from going on board with a carry-on bag + personal item?","['United doesn\'t let you check in online, you have to do it at the counter.

I’ve found there is sometimes a difference between international and domestic carriers. \n\nRecently flew American Airlines and British Airways on Basic Economy. They’ve actually relaxed their baggage policies since their initial roll-out of BE and now allow a personal item and regular carryon. Boarding in the last group, I was worried I’d have to check my bag because there may be no space. But never had an issue at all. I travel a fair amount and find that especially on long-hauls there is usually space because the gate agents put the fear of god in people as they wait to board and ask people to be proactive and let them gate check. I’ve been on flights where they’ve asked so many people to gate check that the bins have been only 75% full. If you’re asked to gate check on AA or BA, my experience is that they won’t charge you. \n\nI don’t have experience with United because I do not fly them, but have heard their BE is more restrictive. Which could explain why one poster commented they size your bag up at the check-in counter. Any time they make you do anything at the counter, I think that’s where they’re more likely to charge you.\n\nMany international airlines that fly between countries outside the US all have different rules. It is common to read about size and weight restrictions for some. I tend to buy a fare that allows one checked bag or pay for a bag to not worry about it when I fly within Europe, for instance. If they have a weight restriction and your bag appears large, they may ask about it. And some airlines will place a tag on your bag that means it’s a bag you need to store under your seat.

My parents wanted to do a last big family vacation for the family before they ended up with too many grand children to make it feasible. They rented a villa for march break (2020, March 14 - March 21st) and asked us to book our flights. It needs to be march break as my sister is a teacher and it her only time off outside of Christmas that isn't during hurricane season. We were checking flights yesterday and were shocked to realize Westjet had no flights available to Pearson (YYZ. We checked air Canada that only had preferred seating for the departing flight and Business class for the return (at an extortionate total cost of $8,300 for two adults and a child). Checking Skyscanner only shows terribly long layovers that make no sense.

&#x200B;

Montreal has 0 flights for the return for west jet and no direct for air canada. I'm wondering if it's related to the 737 max grounding. Just checked buffalo and their flights are even longer layovers (4 days of travel total) for total of $5k. There are flights available the week of March 28th so it is not that it is too early.

Using google flights , I can find a westjet roundtrip for $3,500 but when I click to book, it direct me to the westjet site and informs me it is not available.

The first leg of the flight was with Aer Lingus and the 2nd leg into FLL was with Jetblue.  Upon realizing in FLL that his luggage was missing he filled out a report.  The only thing that has been determined since (now in the 4th day) is that the luggage never made it to Boston.  We receive no calls from either airline and when we call them, Aer Lingus says that its up to Jet Blue to get him his luggage, as he filed the report with them and Jet Blue says they never received it but are looking into it.  

&#x200B;

Needless to say it's a major bummer but that aside is there something more we can be doing?  Is it true that JetBlue have the liability in this scenario?  Does anyone/airline insider knows what happens with lost luggage? is there a central depository where lost luggage would end up by region or airline?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!","['Were these two legs purchased under one ticket or are they separate? (If they were separate, he may have needed to go to baggage claim in Boston and get the bags and recheck them into the 2nd airline.)\n\nDoes your luggage claim tickets that were given to you show FLL on them as the destination? (Important to check. Make sure it was ticketed all the way. Also confirming they didn\'t send it to some random airport by mistake.) \n\nI also assume you did pre-clearance in Dublin and so didn\'t go through customs/Immigration in Boston? (Airports that don\'t have pre-clearance, you would have needed to pickup the bags at customs, have them scanned again before sending them back through to be put on the next plane. But I think Dublin has pre-clearance.) \n\nThe above questions help narrow down to make sure you didn\'t make a mistake, and confirm the airlines should have gotten it to FLL without your intervention.\n\nSo assuming that you did everything right and they should have gone to FLL. The question becomes - Is your luggage properly tagged with your name and/or does it have any unique characteristics?\n\nThen it depends on where the failure point was. Maybe the bag was tagged incorrectly at checkin and was sent completely wrong place. This is less likely (as it would be a huge mistake) but if it is, it may be harder to figure out, as it would have been sent to some random airport and assumed abandon. I\'m not sure if they\'d be able to track back this mistake easily.\n\nOr did something happen and it simply just didn\'t make it onto the plane or was delayed in some way. 4 days later would be stretching this theory, but this means it could be somewhere in Dublin or Boston in a holding area. \n\nIts possible that the tag saying where the bag was to go fell off, and they are trying to figure out where the bag really should be going (Which is why something unique on the bag can help find it quicker than ""generic black bag"").\n\nI\'ve had bags that showed up late, and my sister had a bag that was lost in the bowels of the Denver airport for over 4 months (and only found because it was a unique appearance.) \n\nEither way, all you can do is continue to bug them. Find out what their temporary delayed reimbursement policy is if you don\'t already know. And once it moves from temporary to actually lost (can take a while depending on the airline) then follow their claim procedures.\n\nDon\'t forget that its not just the airline you can file claims with. You may be able to file with any travel insurance if you have it. Or with credit card protections that bought the flights and/or items.

**Saturday**

Flew JetBlue from New York to Cancun because we got a good deal. Flight was delayed a few hours, but we got some travel credits, which was much appreciated. The original plan was to pick up a rental car from Hertz at the airport, but due to the flight delay, they were closed when we arrived. However we reserved the car through AmEx, and they helped move the reservation to pickup the next day. So when we landed, we went straight to the hotel through a cab at the airport. We chose the official partner (maybe SuperShuttle? Forgot to document this). The ride seemed expensive for what it was, but was ultimately fine.

We wanted to stay somewhere easy to get to, efficient, clean, and downtown/not in the hotel district, and chose Suites Malecon Cancun. This was a BIG MISTAKE. When we arrived and went into our room, whoever was there previously had smoked in the bathroom and it smelled horribly. Tried to steam/air it out, but only succeeded a little bit. There were stains on the bedspread and lampshade. The air conditioner was difficult to figure out, and ultimately made the room pretty cold. But all this could have been forgiven if the room had sufficient soundproofing. My guess is that the hotel was built in a hurry, and they did a shoddy job. Even though we were on the 14th floor, with the windows closed, metal window gates closed and A/C running, we could still hear the bars across the street. Even worse, there was some kind of fun run event that started before dawn across the street that featured loudspeakers blasting music to get the runners motivated. We could also hear other guests in their rooms talking and when they dropped things on the floor. It was very frustrating not to get any sleep after the delayed flight.


**Sunday**

The next annoying hurdle was Hertz. Even though we reserved a car online, they said since we didn't pre-pay, they didn't have to honor the reservation for the car we wanted. All they had available was a Dodge Grand Caravan. It was much bigger than we needed, and ended up costing us more in gas than a regular car would have. But it drove nicely, and the A/C worked well.

The drive to Merida was mostly uneventful. Took the tollway most of the trip, which was fast and had no traffic. Got stopped on the Yucatan/Quintana Roo border by a federale. He let us go through without hassle (queue foreshadowing music). Stayed in Koox Art 64 Boutique Hotel in El Centro. Generally a nice place with very helpful employees and lovely pool. Room had good A/C, huge TV, cute patio, large closet, safe, comfortable/pillows, and ceiling fan. Downsides were that there was no bathroom door, not great soundproofing (birds, neighboring children), no fridge in room, and it seemed relatively easy for bugs to get in. The room was upstairs, and there was a shared kitchen and living room downstairs.

Checked out Merida en Domingo that day, which was really fun. Traditional dancing, tons of vendors and people around. Had a sopa de lima snack from one of the stands, which was kind of weak. Went for lunch to Manjar Blanco. Very tasty. Tried panuchos, papadzules, and relleno negro. Rest of the day was spent walking around, swimming and checking out thing around town.

For dinner, went to Tikin Xic on the north side of town. Food was good, cheap, and the staff was nice. Great botanas and ceviche. The namesake dish was good too. After, checked out the funk/blues jam at Dzalbay. It was decently fun.

I guess it's at this point that I'll also mention something that seems pretty obvious, and it's that Merida is HOT. Even in February, it was 90s during the day. And a lot of places don't have A/C, probably because most people are used to it.


**Monday**

Lots more walking around and city exploring. Had some breakfast tacos at Taqueria La Lupita. They were excellent. Amazing Cochinita and lechon. So much flavor and fantastic texture.

It's cool that Merida had kind of a heyday in the mid 1800s. Paseo de Montejo has a lot of beautiful, ornate old buildings that look like they should be an embassy or something. Checked out some of the large markets as well, at people's recommendations here. Had a hard time figuring out where the ""best"" places were. The hawkers were kind of aggressive and I wasn't ready for it. Ending up having some Poc Chuc, which was okay but left me wanting. Walked around some more and had some tepache and ice cream, both of which were fine but nothing special.

Walked around more, swam more to beat the heat and rested at the hotel. Had some fish tacos at El Fabuloso Pez. Nice presentation, though the place seemed pretty corporate/cookie cutter. Got a little bit sick from the food. Went to Golden Island Casino after, which was disappointing, as it was almost entirely video slots. 

Took an Uber back to Centro and went to Pipiripau for a drink and it was totally dead. Then went to La Negrita. Bands were playing, people dancing, super fun scene. Had some ceviche, which was uninspiring, but didn't matter. Negrita was great.


**Tuesday**

Day trip to Uxmal for ruins. Walked around a bunch. Lots of tourists around obviously, but it was cool. Didn't pay for a guide or tour or anything. Just wandered. Saw some lizards get into an intense fight. Left to go to Hacienda Mucuyche for lunch and the cenote. Lunch was fine, nothing special. Had some salbutes, chips, water and other snacks. The cenote was done as part of a tour group. Kind of felt Disney-ified, but was super beautiful. Wish we had longer to swim around. Went to cenote Kankirixche after, which was also pretty, but the opposite experience. Instead of a guided tour and guides and stuff, you just gave the guy $30MX for a little laminated card. Then you give the card to the guy by the cenote and he just lets you do your thing. Very different experiences, both fun.

Got stopped again by federales getting back into Yucatan. They seemed perplexed that I didn't speak Spanish and let me go. Had reservations at Nectar for dinner, but wife got super sick either from lunch or accidentally drinking cenote water or something. Had to cancel the reservation. People at the hotel suggested Uber Eats for delivery, and figured why not. Wanted to see what the burrito was like, and ordered one from La Taque. It came on a paper tray, wrapped in plastic, which was weird, but was very tasty. And huge! No rice either, just meat and cheese wrapped up and grilled a bit.


**Wednesday**

Woke up for a taco brunch. Walked to Taqueria Yucatan. Good tacos! Great tortillas! Nice service even though they didn't speak any English, and my Spanish is very limited. The chaya con huevos was excellent. Checked out of hotel and drove to Wayan'e for more tacos. Loved the variety and amazing flavors. I'd read about green chorizo but never eaten it before. Really delicious. Didn't love that they charged me for 6 tacos and only gave me 5, and that the prices on the receipt didn't match the menu. But the food was great, so I wasn't complaining.

Started the drive out of Merida to El Cuyo for some beach time. Stopped by Federales, because of course. I booked with Mattias through VRBO, emailed back and forth a few times to confirm details, including within a week of our scheduled arrival, and everything seemed like it was going to be setup for a nice stay.

Got into El Cuyo, located the Hacienda, knocked on the door, and another guest let us in. They told me I should message Mattias or his assistant Magally via WhatsApp for the keys. So I messaged Magally and she told me that there were no rooms available. I sent her a photo of my confirmation, but she was not apologetic and offered no alternatives. VRBO had only one other place in El Cuyo, Cabanas El Cuyo. It was super bare bones. Wood plank room, bad lighting, sub par bed & pillows, no A/C, bad water pressure, luke warm shower. If there were neighbors, I would have heard everything the did. But Reyes, the guy running it, was nice enough. And it was right on the beach, so the breeze was great and the view was incredible.

Unfortunately, Reyes also suggested getting dinner at Loncheria La Lupita. Got some tacos, gringas and salbutes. I say unfortunately, because maybe it wasn't the cleanest place, because I got really sick from the food. Had a rough night.


**Thursday**

Didn't sleep much that night. Decided that it would be nicer outside than inside and rolled around on a lounger for a few hours. Had some water. Ventured into town for some pancakes at Naia Cafe. Right on cue, more Federales show up. These ones were very interested in me and my passport. Took one of the other diner's passports and didn't seem to give it back. Pancakes were mediocre. Could have used some baking soda. Hung out more on the beach. Weather was mid 80s and beautiful. Maybe only two other people within sight on the beach. Totally chill.

Originally had an idea to get dinner in Tizimin, but after seeing the roads and lack of lighting, changed plans. Got dinner that night at Chile Gordo. It's run by a nice British woman and very cute. Food is central Mexican/Veracruz in style and good. Walked around El Cuyo some more. Kids were preparing for Carnival the next week. Watched them a bit. Star gazed. Had some night beach. Cooled off at night to upper 70s.


**Friday**

Packed up and left El Cuyo. Drove through Yucatan. Got stopped by Federales once again. This guy kept saying there was something wrong with license plates of the rental van. Wouldn't let us go. He said we had to go to Merida for some kind of inspection and similar nonsense. We said we could not do that. Eventually he asked for a bribe. Being that we had to catch a flight, ended up paying and then leaving. He said be careful.

Filled up the van, took it back to Hertz. Still waiting to see if they charge anything extra for damage that doesn't exist. Flight home was thankfully uneventful other than that the Direct TV/movies didn't work.

I would recommend you call back and ask that you be ""ruled over"" to another carrier.  If the person you talk to won\'t do it, demand a supervisor.  They will eventually give you one.  Generally there is a trigger point at 3 request for a supervisor before one is given without fail.\n\nIf this fails, send me a message and I\'ll help you with some further suggestions.  I am no longer in the industry, however I am very knowledgeable about this particular situation.

There\'s no way they should hold you hostage for extra cash or overnighting when it\'s their rescheduling that screwed you over.\n\nETA: if you want them to do this though, do your research. Find the flights that are flying NYC -> DC that will work for you on that day. I\'ve never taken JetBlue so I\'m not sure if they\'re part of an alliance, but it can be easier if the other airline is in their network.', ""If all else fails, airtran to downtown, chinatown bus from downtown NYC to DC are like 10-20 dollars.

Generally speaking he bought a ticket from Punta Cana to DCA...not a ticket from Punta Cana to JFK then another from JFK to DCA.  What they\'ll do is reprice it as Punta Cana to JFK and refund the difference (at least that\'s my guess).  That difference will be negligible, if anything - except the savings in taxes.  \n\nNow there is an accounting system that is able to split fares with stopovers and provide a refund but on that ticket the leg from JFK-DCA is still going to be only a tiny fraction of the total amount.

In the meantime, if you do speak to a supervisor and they are stonewalling you - use the phrase ""I intend to file a complaint with the Department of Transportation if this is not resolved.""  This effects airline\'s rankings in all those satisfaction reports you see and even 1 additional complain can move an airline in rank. \n\nAnother question - did you book directly with JetBlue or via a travel agent?

Since I was basically a first time flyer I was super meticulous with the bag sizes and liquids. We flew JetBlue Economy and I ended up having to pay for one checked bag. But a couple weeks before we left I went out and got new luggage and mini backpacks to use as myself and my daughters carry on and personal bags. They weren't expensive, but I spent like $60 with the mind set that buying new luggage in the smaller, correct sizes will prevent a SECOND $60 checked bag fee each way.I had a cute, brand new book bag that was going to be my daughter's personal bag, but because the measurements of the bag went just over the stated limit on the website, I didn't take it.

So we get to the airport and meet my sister in law, and she also has one daughter, and they both have these big backpacks and rolling luggage about the same size as our rolling carry ons. I was like, aren't your bags going to be too big to be a personal item?! She was like, No! I hope not. They had just traveled to CA and back so I trusted her, and she was right.

It seemed to me neither airport, BWI or MCO, cared much about the size of the carry on and personal bags, as long as they fit where they were supposed to. 

Can I expect this same laid back approach with most other airlines? Looking at an American Airlines economy flight...","[""It's really straightforward.\n\n1.) If your carry-on luggage meets the airline's stated regulations for size and weight then obviously you'll have no issues.\n\n2.)

Part of this is how it *looks*. If it looks like a big piece that you are struggling to pull, they are more likely to ask you to weigh it.  If it looks like you are moving it about nimbly and easily they are less likely to ask for a weight, even less so if it is a backpack or duffel that you are carrying with no signs of exertion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ""personal item"" is much more ambiguous since the guideline is often ""a purse, laptop or camera bag"" with no actual dimensions listed.

But my experience was so different than expected. Everyone had standard-large sized back packs as their personal bag. My family’s book bags were technically over size limits -  (not my daughter and I’s, of course with our semi-mini back packs) had you laid the bag flat and pulled it out each way to shape it into its natural form, the dimensions don’t check out.

If it does get measured, they'll have a bin of the specified dimensions; if your bag fits entirely within the bin, then you can bring it on board, and if it doesn't, then you will probably have to gate-check it (possibly for a fee). As long as your bag is soft-sided and partially full such that you can fold or squeeze it down to the required dimensions, it will be fine; doesn't matter how large it would be if stuffed to capacity. \n\nHow often airlines measure varies quite a bit, and will often depend on other factors as well. Sometimes you can get away with a slightly oversized bag because they'll only measure items which are obviously oversized, and sometimes they will be in a hurry to board and won't bother measuring anything no matter how ridiculous (unless it clearly won't even fit in an overhead bin). Other times they may be quite strict about it and may measure any item that looks even close to the max size. Weight is checked less frequently than size, but could still be checked, so it's advisable to make sure you are under the weight limit as well. \n\nAlso, note that airlines *can* require you to check your bag at the gate regardless of its size. This is usually only an issue with larger bags that can't go under the seat, as overhead bin space is often limited and there usually isn't actually room for every person on the flight to place a bag in the bins, so if a lot of people have brought large carry-on bags, some of them may end up having to be checked at the gate. If your bag has to be checked for capacity reasons, you usually won't be charged a fee, though (as long as the bag would normally have been allowed for free under your ticket, anyway). "", ""> I thought it was pretty straight forward.\n\nAnd it is. It's *exactly* as I posted.\n\n> But my experience was so different than expected.\n\nYour one experience is not at all unique. Lots of people travel over the limit and rarely pay the price. Others do it once and are forced to check it. \n\nSince it's not automatically sized/weighed at check-in then there is of course always lots of slop in how the regulations are enforced. If you're okay with that uncertainty then go for it, you'll slip by lots of times. If you want it to be a zero stress, no brainer situation then simply stick to the rules. \n\n>  Going on a longer trip to a smaller country soon and hoping we can get by with one carry on and one personal bag each for about 10 days! I know it can be easily done, but being an over-packer, this is a unique challenge for me! \n\nYou're right it is easily done and there's a zillion great resources to help you get your packing under control.

Yesterday, I read about the JetBlue $64 roundtrip sale that was happening between NYC and tons of major cities around the country. Impulsively, I bought two trips. While checking out, I read fine print that said all flights were refundable within 24 hours of purchase, provided the trip was at least seven days out (mine were). I planned to spend last night thinking it over/researching, then decide which flight I wanted to keep and cancel the other today.

However, I just got off the phone with a JB agent who said, ""Fun fact, you actually can't cancel these sales. The fine FINE print says these tickets are nonrefundable/transferable. Shoulda read closer, joke's on you, etc.""

I hate to think there's nothing I can do in this situation, and that I'm just gonna be out $140 (though I'm aware that I'm probably just SOL on this one). Does anyone know of any loopholes to cancel on flash sale promotions similar to this one?

[UPDATE]: Thanks to /u/boobsaredopes advice, I emailed JetBlue telling them it was illegal not to let any passenger cancel any flight within 24 hours of booking...and they were immediately like, ""Oh, no, we're so sorry -- you actually CAN cancel your flight.""

Our connecting flight was delayed and arrived just in time for jetblue to close the gate early and force us to reschedule on the next flight 2 1/2 hours later.  We all scheduled our flight so that we would arrive back in Boston in time for work. Now we have had to reschedule 3 meetings and burn 2 more hours of vacation time. I spoke with a gate agent and simply asked for some simple food vouchers so that we could get some breakfast while we waited.  She shunned me off with a sly smile telling me she was waiting on a supervisor.  I then went to the Jetblue help desk and finally got a supervisor on my own.  She then told me there was nothing she could do and that I should call the 1-800 number and speak to a customer service rep.  At this point I was more irritated by the lack of respect so I called a customer service rep named Amber who then proceeded to tell me that I would have to file a complaint through their ""speak up"" button on the website and that she could provide no help.  I clicked on the speak up button and went to the compensation section only to find that the button to choose departure dates is a 'javascript(0);' call.  In other words, it does nothing.

As far as I can tell Jetblue's policy is to give us vouchers worth $25 for future travel on their airline.  Given their absolute lack of respect for their own motto, I would prefer to not get compensated with something that just gives them more money. 

Any advice on what you guys think I should do, or have any of you run into a level of customer service incompetence of this caliber?","['Let me preface my response by saying that I agree with you that the customer service agents handled your situation poorly.  I will touch on that in a moment.\n\nHowever, this needs to be said first:  if you needed to be somewhere at an exact time, scheduling a flight with a connection at JFK is, frankly, not the greatest of ideas.  As just about everyone in the western world knows, JFK is incredibly prone to delays.  Some low cloud ceilings, a relatively small amount of precipitation, or even high winds over at Newark and/or LaGuardia...and you\'re looking at a two-hour ground delay program.  Be a smart traveler.  If the non-stop costs $40 more than the flight with a 30 minute connection at JFK...spend the $40.  Delays happen.\n\nAs for JetBlue, here\'s the CliffsNotes:  They used to be a pretty great airline and, in some ways, still are.  David Neeleman, a devout Mormon with pretty severe ADD, founded the airline on the idea of providing a good, modern product and good customer service.  Unfortunately, like much of Corporate America, the Board of Directors decided to take their cues from industry consultants and decided that Neeleman\'s idea of ""Good Customer Service, whatever the small cost"" just wasn\'t so great for the shareholders\' short-term profits.  They ran Neeleman out of the company (and, in some ways, out of the country...he moved to Brazil and launched a new carrier there, called [Azul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azul_Brazilian_Airlines)).  \n\nWhile JetBlue seem to still provide a better product that most U.S. domestic carriers, that product is nowhere near what it used to be.   At the beginning, JetBlue really seemed to follow the Southwest Airlines mantra of ""empower the employee to do what is right"".  However, if you are going to operate based on that mantra, you have to stick with it.  Now, at the direction of their management, JetBlue customer service employees are limited in what level of compensation they are allowed to offer...most likely in the form of a compensation matrix like other major airlines use.\n\nAll in all, JetBlue is still a good airline to fly.  Just don\'t expect to be lavished with freebies when you miss your flight and are rebooked on the next available flight.  Really, that goes for most airlines in a situation like yours...the airline has done their part in recovering from the bad situation and getting you to where you paid them to take you.', '[deleted]', ""You can try complaining on Twitter. There's a real person operating it, whose job is to make JetBlue's public image look better.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/jetblue\n\nHaven't tried it myself, but it'll take five seconds and might amount to something."", 'The plane taxied out early for de-icing and as far as i can tell left on time. It was a red-eye so I then proceeded to fall asleep until we were over NYC. When we landed the crew made no attempt to let passengers with imminent connecting flights off first as I have experienced with other airlines. so by the time we got off the plane the gate was closed. and then sat there for a good 20 minutes at the gate with the doors shut.', ""I don't have a twitter account and I sort of figure that a new account with 0 followers would garner 0 attention from jetblue.

We're planning to travel through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and finally Uruguay before returning. We are thinking about departing from Montevideo in late January 2013. However, we are hoping to keep our return date and location flexible in case our itinerary is too ambitious for a $5,000-$5,500 budget. Any thoughts on that?

Correct me if I am wrong. From what I gather, it seems that U.S. law requires proof of onward travel when visiting Colombia, but it is the airline's discretion how strictly to enforce it. I have seen conflicting advice about how to deal with it. Has anyone flown JetBlue to Colombia and been in this situation before? 

Will we be allowed to fly LAX to Bogota without return tickets? If not, what do you recommend we do?
","[""they don't tend to play at the airport. The airline is the one held responible (and sometimes fined) if a passenger is rejected by customs, so even for counrties that really don't check or care too much, the airline remains rigid.

You are not storing your passwords properly. I recently had a bag that did not make it to my stop. The jetblue lady signed me up for Travel Bank. I was shocked when I was sent login info of my current jetblue username and password. This shows me that my data is not safe with jetblue. If you are hashing passwords like you should you are unable to reverse the password back to plain text. The correct way to store passwords would be to take the users password, add a salt to it (this would be a random sting added to the end of the users pass), hash (this is a no reversible encryption) then store this in your data base. When the user goes to login the server takes the password and adds the salt to it then checks this off the data base. A better way to do this is to assign a random salt to each user in the database. then do the same as above but grab the salt from the database. This needs to be fixed ASAP as its a huge venerability to users security. If you have any questions please contact me.

It appears that I'll have access to the Comfort Lounge, HSBC Premier Lounge, or the Primeclass CIP Lounge. All 3 are open 24 hours, but I may need to visit two of them if they're strict about the 4 hour limits, so please rank the 3 from most to least favorable. For this one, please factor in the ability to take a nap in a chair or on a couch. 

**I'm looking for suggestions for each airport. Thanks!**","['Dude, there are loads of websites out there that review lounges. How did you waste so much time writing that but were too lazy to Google?', ""Regarding JFK, Air France is great...if you can get in. Air France Lounges are notorious for shitting on their agreement with Priority Pass, and *will* tell you the lounge is full even as you watch other people enter without a problem. I honestly don't know why we're even pretending they honor PP at this point. \n\nThe Korean Lounge, on the other hand, is okay but by no means fancy. You shouldn't have a problem getting in, and they have some nice options when it comes to complimentary food and drinks. \n\nSide note that these two lounges are basically right next to each other, so you can try Air France first and then head on over to Korean after the desk maid inevitably snubs her nose at you."", ""We're an IT and PMP Consultant  r/digitalnomad and r/longtermtravel couple, and as you can imagine we use lounge access \\(thanks to Priority Pass\\) often and regularly \\(over 45 lounges in the last 18 months\\).\n\nWe'll try to help but keep in mind that what defines a *good lounge* varies from person to person and their individual needs and preferences. With that being said, for us, having a good place to work \\(A/C outlet to plug into and a comfortable table\\-chair combination\\) along with healthy food options are super important.\n\nAlso, we don't drink so we can't really shed light from that perspective. :\\-\\)\n\n**JFK** \\- Sorry we haven't yet visited a lounge here.  :\\-\\(\n\n**IST** \\- We visited **Prime Class Lounge** at IST and really liked it. It's very large and has a ton of seating, including a few large conference like tables for plugging in, charging phones or working on a laptop. The lounge has two rooms, one large main room and a smaller side room. Both have food and drink options, along with seating, so if the main room is full, check out the other room \\(to the left when you enter\\). When we were there \\(during breakfast time\\) they had hot and cold food options \\(including local cuisine\\) and several drink options. They have** complementary shower**s \\(be sure to sign up right away if you want to make use of them, as there was a wait time when we visited\\). BTW, bathrooms are inside the lounge area.\n\n**ATH** \\- We went to two lounges at ATH to find a good working area for our specific needs \\(we stayed at the second lounge\\).\n\n1. **Skyserv Melina Merkouri Lounge** in Terminal B. There were smoking rooms **inside** of the lounge, it was clean and modern, but there's very little space for working and AC outlets for plugging into. There is a business center area with a printer though. The food was limited to cold snacks and pastries and other *bread* type options.\n2. **Goldair Handling CIP Lounge**. There was plenty of seating along with a large table with AC for plugging into and working. There was a decent food bar with mainly cold food options, but it also has vegetables and salad. It also had a smoking room **inside** the lounge, and bathrooms.\n\n**General tips for finding lounges:**\n\n* Download the free [Lounge Buddy](https://www.loungebuddy.com) app to find lounge reviews and additional pictures. We utilize this app to narrow our choices down when there are a couple of different lounges available to choose from.\n* If you have unlimited lounge access, don't be shy about entering multiple lounges to find the one that best fits what you're looking for. We did this in Athens, as the first lounge we entered didn't have a good working space and was **very** full. In contrast, the second lounge was nearly empty and had a table to work at.\n* If you have a limited number of lounge passes, ask the receptionist if you can take a quick walk/tour of the lounge. This way, you can see what the lounge offers and how crowded it is without using a pass. If you like what you see, register and stay, if not, move along. :\\-\\)\n* As we've said we've been to over 45 lounges and we've never had a lounge enforce a time limit \\(just our experience\\). So, while it could happened, it probably won't. Although, do keep in mind that some Priority Pass lounges get very full, so we could see it being enforced during busy hours.\n* At SFO, Priority Pass uses the Air France/KLM lounge \\(which is within the international terminal\\), although we were able to get through security and enter the lounge even though we were flying domestically on Southwest. We've heard that PP sometimes does this and that accessing a lounge within an international terminal isn't a problem \\(when flying domestically\\), but we don't have any first hand experience other than SFO. Also, you may need to go through security twice, depending on the airport, if you're flying domestically \\(international and domestic terminals\\).\n\nHappy travels!"", ""Yes, goolging was my first step.  I found some good info, but was hoping perhaps for a bit more, which as you can see, another user graciously provided.  I guess I don't really understand why you felt the need to comment if you were just going to make baseless accusations and then yell at me based on them..."", ""Yeah, that's what I've been reading :/   I'm trying to get a text based confirmation that Priority Pass members are welcome, but if they don't want to let me in, I have a feeling there's nothing I can really do. That's really crappy.\n\nThe issue with the KAL Business Lounge is that it doesn't open until 2:00 PM for Priority Pass members, and I'll be gone by 2. I mean I'm sure I can figure out something to do for a little while, but if that something could be relaxing and eating some free food and having some free drinks in a lounge, that would be nice."", ""Thanks so much for sharing your experience, this is extremely helpful! \n\nEdit: Just noticed you're getting downvoted for actually helping while the other person who just stopped by to yell at me is getting upvoted... Smh. Regardless, thanks again."", ""You might actually have better luck at the Air France Lounge during the day. I imagine it's more crowded at night since many transatlantic flights leave in the evening or early morning."", ""Happy to do so! What good is knowledge/experience if you don't share it ;\\-\\) \n\nHave a wonderful time! We loved Athens and were fortunate enough to have a house sit in downtown for nearly two weeks, so we had time to explore the city. If you're staying in the city, be sure to explore. The ancient ruin sites are breathtaking \\(especially the Athens Acropolis and Temple of Olympian Zeus\\) and a must see, but also don't miss the different neighborhoods, street art, and views from the hilltops. \n\nHappy Travels!""]"

103,Really highly recommend not using Expedia.com for travel-- here is my terrible experience,0,7p1bqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7p1bqd/really_highly_recommend_not_using_expediacom_for/,25,1515471315.0,"First of all, be prepared any time you call their customer service line to be on the phone due to being on hold, being transferred to a different rep, ""my computer is being slow"", ""I'm just pulling up your profile"" etc for at least an hour and a half. I have called them about 6 times in the past month and have never spent less than 55 minutes, one call was more than two hours.


I booked a trip to Playa del Carmen to a resort with my boyfriend and bought trip insurance back in the fall from Jan 4 to 11 through Expedia. We broke up (lol) so I called to cancel the trip and was refunded and received airline credits. In order to go myself I had to call and rebook, which I did from Jan 4 to 8. 


Winter storm Grayson appeared on January 4 so I ended up just canceling the whole trip because my flight down to Cancun got canceled. I was told if I called Expedia before 11 am on January 4 to cancel the trip that I would receive a full refund from the hotel, so I called the night of January 3 to cancel the trip again.


This is where things go to shit. I spent two hours on the phone with a rep who supposedly canceled the trip for me. He was befuddled because he was asking me to check my email about getting a cancelation email and I never did. He finally ""manually"" sent one which is just some text and looked kind of sketchy. He also asked me to check my Expedia.com profile to make sure the trip said canceled. It never did but he didn't seem concerned. I never got another email about the cancelation and I kept checking my Expedia.com profile and the trip still said in progress. How odd, I thought...


Today, I kept getting emails from JetBlue about checking in for my flight. Checked my profile again and trip still said in progress. I called customer service again to make sure the trip was properly canceled. The woman I was on the phone with was getting increasingly annoyed at me because I kept saying please, can you resend the email about the flight credit, can you please resend the email about the trip cancelation, why does it say still in progress on my profile, etc. I'm glad I kept harping on her.


After 20 minutes of her saying ""I promise it is canceled!"" she realized that she was looking at the wrong trip. 


THEY HAD NEVER CANCELED THE SECOND TRIP AFTER I SPOKE WITH 4 CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. I'm now out $900 and a $200 flight credit. I'm a grad student. I don't have this kind of money to be throwing around on a trip I never went on. I'm about to have a panic attack because I'm still on hold to speak to her manager (and have been on hold for half an hour) and I don't think I""m going to get refunded.



I would HIGHLY recommend not using Expedia if there is any tiny chance at all that something is going to happen to your trip and you are going to have to contact customer service. I would never, ever want someone else to have to go through this ridiculous situation and I think it's truly not worth it. Next time I travel, I'd rather pay more to book through a better service or even the resort itself. 




EDIT: I GOT A FULL REFUND. I still think their customer service is atrocious and I had to spend an additional four hours on the phone but I did it. I just kept asking to speak to managers until I made it up to corporate, explained the situation, and had them pull the recording of the call. Was supposed to hear from them about it after 72 hours, didn't, called back and bitched my way up to corporate again. Once they listened to it they realized that I was right and their agent had screwed up!! Either that or they were sick of me calling. The people in corporate were way better to talk to though.

112,Items stolen from checked luggage which was searched by TSA.,2,68g14v,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/68g14v/items_stolen_from_checked_luggage_which_was/,23,1493595314.0,"I left St. Lucia yesterday afternoon with four bottles of rum packed in one of my bags. When I arrived home late last night I found only two bottles of rum in the bag and a notification from the TSA that my bag had been searched. We had to change plans at JFK on our way back to Boston, which is where the search must have taken place.

I have contacted JetBlue to alert them to the issue and ask for their assistance. I will also be filing a complaint with the TSA per the instructions on their website. Does anyone else who has had a similar experience have any further suggestions of action I could take?

I am beyond frustrated at this. I visited the island last year and brought home one bottle of a particular rum I liked. After finishing that bottle off I wished I had bought more. This time down I bought two bottles of that same rum and found two other types I liked of which I bought one bottle each. They are all St. Lucian rums and are not available anywhere near NH. One of the rums stolen was only available at the distillery which I visited during the vacation.

It's not the money involved as it's only about $80 worth of rum, but the fact that these were my souvenirs which I intended to enjoy for months to come as a reminder of my trip to the island were stolen from me in such a blatant manner. I entrusted my bags to JetBlue and the TSA only to have this happen. Now I'm just getting ready for each to say the other could have been at fault and both deny any responsibility. Even if the TSA does admit fault, I don't want the money...I want the damn rum I purchased!

I couldn't take these items in my carry-on luggage like I do with all other valuable items since that amount of liquids cannot go through security.

I can't get over that they would search my bag, take two bottles of rum and then leave the notice indicating the bag was searched. It's essentially leaving a business card at the scene of the a crime you just committed.

Maybe I should just be happy they didn't take all of the rum and were nice enough to leave me two of the bottles.

So if anyone who has had a similar experience and has advice to lend (beyond contacting JetBlue and filing a complaint with the TSA) it would be very appreciated.

**Airline B:** 

 1. Depart New York, New York after the 1.5hr layover
 2. Arrive in Phoenix, Arizona as my ultimate destination on Nov 28th

Im concerned because I don't want to leave my bags in NY when I get to Arizona. Also, don't I have to go through customs in New York?

Does she get one bag for free or is she to pay for each and every bag?

What about medications? Can she place them in her bag and they pass through okay?

How early would she need to get there? (Tampa, FL) How fast/slow can the lines be? I haven't been on a plane since I was 7.

What is a suitable time to have for a layover so she can get her stuff and not miss the next flight?\n\nReally depends on the airport and also your aunt\'s travel abilities. Assuming it\'s all domestic, the minimum you\'d want is to have a 1 hour gap between flights, but 1.5-2+ for safety (assuming there might be delays or you need to move between terminals or something at a large airport like Chicago O\'Hare).\n\n> How big are these seats? She is kind of a big lady and I don\'t want her to be super uncomfortable.\n\nUsually between 17-19 inches wide, and 32-34 inches of pitch in economy (pitch is basically distance from back of your seat to the seat in front of you). Also depends on the plane. Some airlines like JetBlue and Alaska Airlines allow you to spend a little extra to upgrade to seats with 6-7 more inches of legroom. A business or first class seat will have a lot more legroom, but a domestic BC/FC ticket can cost 2-3x more than an economy ticket.\n\nAlso, if your aunt is a really big lady (we\'re talking very big), airlines can request that she buy a second seat to accommodate her size. Airlines state that if you can not be secured in your seat with the armrests down and with the seatbelt and an extension belt, then a passenger has to either upgrade or buy an additional seat. [Here\'s an example from United\'s page](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/specialneeds/extra-seating.aspx).\n\n> Does she get one bag for free or is she to pay for each and every bag?\n\nDepends on airline and these days, the fare class. Pretty much everyone allows you a carry on that fits in an overhead space that is 40-45 linear inches, and that\'s a bag/luggage that would be big enough to store several days worth of clothing with normal packing.\n\nMost domestic carriers make you pay for checking a bag (like $25-30 a bag), though Southwest allows 2 and Jetblue allows 1 for free.\n\nIf you\'re unsure about the carrier you\'re using, you can google ""**AIRLINE** carry-on limits"" and get all the information you\'d need.\n\n> What about medications? Can she place them in her bag and they pass through okay?\n\nIf her medications are liquid/gel-based, they need to go into a quart-sized bag because of the [TSA Liquid Rule](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule). This quart sized bag of liquids will have to be taken out of luggage when passing through security and scanned.\n\nAlso, the above only applies to carry-on luggage. If your aunt is checking a bag she can just stuff her medication in her checked luggage (unless she needs to have the medication for the flight).\n\nOtherwise, having medication is going to be fine (unless it were something like medical marijuana :p).\n\n> How early would she need to get there? (Tampa, FL) How fast/slow can the lines be? I haven\'t been on a plane since I was 7.\n\nThe general guideline is to be at the airport 1 hour before a domestic flight, 2 hours before an international flight. I don\'t have any experience with Tampa Airport, though, so I don\'t know how packed or busy it is. For safety and because of unfamiliarity, I\'d just go with being at the airport 2 hours in advance - you never know if your aunt will have to go through security screening with 600 people ahead of her because a bunch of flights are leaving at the same time.', ""For a layover, have a minimum  of around 2 hours for domestic, 3.5-4 for international to cover for delays. For medications, if they're liquid, you have to delay it. Also, the seats are small, but if you're worried and willing to spend a little more, try business class, or see if you can fly JetBlue. They have larger seats. Depending on the airline she might get one bag free. "", ""> Why do some flights say 6a-10a but the time shows it as 5h? That is really confusing to me\n\nBecause there's a one-hour time change. If you arrive at 10am Central Time, it's 11am in Tampa."", ""> EDIT: New Question. Why do some flights say 6a-10a but the time shows it as 5h? That is really confusing to me\n\nFlights are always listed with local times. That means when you see departure and arrival times for flights, you're seeing the departure time as local to the *departure* city (Tampa, in this case), and the arrival time as local to whatever the *arrival* city is (which sounds like it's an hour behind Tampa in terms of time zones). So The flight time is 5 hours, but she lands at 10am, because she went back one hour in terms of time zones (whereas it would be 11am in Tampa)."", 'Would it be better to go to the airport and book it there so I can get confirmation on some of my questions? It seems that the best option is American Airlines. Would booking on person cost more?

I'm leaning towards the Dominican Republic, because it has 2 countries on one island...  but we can go anywhere that JetBlue flies.

120,Chile in late August for 10 days – thoughts on this itinerary?,3,6entgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6entgo/chile_in_late_august_for_10_days_thoughts_on_this/,10,1496362797.0,"Repost because the formatting was messed up.

I'm heading to Chile in a few months after finding a killer deal on flights to visit a friend on study abroad and to explore the country! It's my first *international* trip alone, and I've been doing a lot of research (because that's honestly part of the fun). Here's the itinerary I've come up with for now, leaving on August 24 and returning on September 4.

* August 25- CHS-FLL; JetBlue, arriving around 3PM. Travel to Miami airport on TriRail, check in around 6PM for an 8:30PM flight on LATAM to Santiago.
* August 26- Arrive in Santiago around 6AM. Meet up with my friend, check into hostel, explore the city (I've got a list of museums/neighborhoods/parks/etc that I want to see, but I'm open to suggestions!).
* August 27- Santiago.
* August 28- Santiago. Grab a late afternoon flight or overnight bus to La Serena.
* August 29- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory).
* August 30- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory). Overnight bus to Santiago.
* August 31- Arrive in Santiago early in the morning, grab a bus to Valpariso.
* September 1- Valpariso.
* September 2- Morning bus to Santiago.
* September 3- Santiago.
* September 4- Santiago, 2:30PM LATAM flight SCL-ASU-GRU-MIA (somehow, it was significantly cheaper this way).
* September 5- Arrive in Miami around 6:30AM. Need to be at FLL for a 6:30 JetBlue flight back to Charleston. Might be meeting a friend for part of the day, but I'm also interested in suggestions for a few hours in Miami.

I'm a 19 y/o guy, and outside of the flights (around $600, already paid), I'm budgeting around $600 for all else. I can increase that, but I'd really prefer not to.

I need to be in Santiago on both weekends so I can meet up with my friend and I'm dead set on seeing Valpariso, but I'm not sure if La Serena is worth the trip. I'm guessing heading south will be too cold in late August/early September, and I visited Death Valley in March and it seems pretty similar to the Atacama. What would you do if you were me, especially regarding the time I'm currently thinking about spending in La Serena?","[""Hey dude,\n\nI'm backpacking around South America and I'm just finishing my month in Chile and heading to Bolivia. Happy to give you some tips from where I've been!\n\nI'd definitely recommend going to San Pedro in the Atacama Desert. I've never been anywhere quite like it in the world. It is a backpacker destination, and the downside is it was one of the more expensive places I stayed in Chile. However if you go behind the market near the church you can find markets and restaurants locals use that are much cheaper than in the main town. I had the best steak and cheese sandwich of my life there. \n\nI didn't do the tours in San Pedro as I'm on a tight budget, but my girlfriend and I rented bikes, explored the Valle del Luna, and also woke up at 5am, cycled in the darkness under the milky way and found a high spot to watch the sun rise.\n\nLa Serena is a nice place, though not a colossal amount to do there. The beach is nothing particularly special. However from La Serena you can stay in Vicuna which is a small rural town that is really nice and do an observatory tour if it's a clear night. You can also get a bus go Pisco Elqui and walk to the Pisco Distillery. The whole valley is really stunning.\n\nValparaiso is a must, it's crazy but in a good way. Most colourful place I've been. I really liked Santiago too, I stayed near the student area (Bellavista)which had loads of cheap places to eat and drink.\n\nDefinitely do the free walking tours in Santiago and Valparaiso, they're really good.\n\nIf you want to know anything more let me know.\n\n"", ""La Serena can be a good place to visit, with day trips to Elqui and Reserva Nacional Pingüino de Humboldt. However, it's not THAT great. If I were you and on my first trip to Chile, I'd fly to Calama and base myself in San Pedro de Atacama for a few nights, hiking and taking the many day trips available out of there. \n\nYou can get really good deals on direct flights from Santiago. Check the Chilean LAN site, https://www.latam.com/es_cl/, NOT the USA one, and you'll usually get much better prices. You have the time to wait for special deals to turn up as well, they frequently post them. Right now you can get a round-trip ticket in the beginning of August from around 170 USD. It's just 2 hours each way. \n\nWhile Atacama/Mojave and Death Valley are both deserts, Death Valley is a boring place compared to the things you can see in the Atacama. Really!\n\nValparaiso is well worth a couple of days of wandering around and seeing cool street art and partying Chileans. The city can be a bit rough, though, so make sure you know where you're going and where you shouldn't go."", '**Notice:** Are you asking for travel advice about Chile?\n\nRead what redditors had to say in the **[weekly destination thread for Chile](http://redd.it/345s1u)**  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/travel) if you have any questions or concerns.*', 'If you decide to go to San Pedro, you should take a flight to Calama (Sky Airlines is a low cost airline, which offers pretty good deals)\n\nYou should stay one day in Calama, so you can take a tour to chuquicamata, which is the largest open pit cooper mine in the world. The tours are FREE and operated by CODELCO. \n\nThe tour is incredible!!! ', ""Ha yeah, the cost of San Pedro is one of the reasons I've been giving heading up there second thoughts, but it sounds like its worth the trip. I'd only be able to be there for two full days, unfortunately, but at least that would help cut costs down.\n\nI'm interested in doing some of the tours, but I've had a really hard time finding accurate price information online. Do you happen to know how much doing some of the tours would cost?\n\nAlso, do you think it's worth heading all the way up there for only 2 full days versus 2 days in the La Serena area (exploring the Elqui Valley, an observatory, maybe Parque Nacional Fray Jorge)?"", ""You can't really check a lot of the tours online, you have to wander down the main street and enquire with the different operators. I saw trips to the Valle de la Luna going for $10,000ch but didn't see prices advertised for the others.\n\nWe did a night sky tour which was awesome - you go to this Chilean astronomers house in the desert and he shows you the completely clear night sky with the milky way visible to the naked eye, and shows you various planets and nebulae with his telescope. Cost $20,000cl.\n\nIf you want to go all the way there for 2 days is up to you really.... we were there for 3 days which was enough time for us since we didn't do a lot of the tours. However we were continuing north afterwards. It may make better sense to spend longer exploring the Elqui Valley than waste time travelling back and forth. At the end of the day you can't do everything - we weren't able to do a lot of Patagonia due to money/travel restrictions as its winter, but at least now we have something to come back for."", ""After a lot of thought, I decided that I'm heading up to San Pedro instead of La Serena as I probably won't be able to come back to Chile for a while. Thanks for your help!"", 'I know this is an older post, but just wondering if you remember where you booked the desert tour stuff with the astronomers telescope? This sounds amazing! Also just wondering if three days was just in San Pedro/Atacama desert area or did that include salt flats in Bolivia? Any info you could give me would be appreciated! Trying to plan some pre & post patagonia trip ideas.', ""Sure, it was this tour: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303681-d8445132-Reviews-Time_Travel_Atacama-San_Pedro_de_Atacama_Antofagasta_Region.html \n\nWe didn't go to the salt flats then, because we went to Bolivia next and did them as part of that trip. It seemed lots of people do do it though, but be careful if you're going in the winter. When we were there that border crossing was closed due to snowfall.\n\nBecause we were on a tight budget a lot of the stuff we did was on our own steam (renting bikes to explore the surroundings) but there were lots of day trips you can do through tour companies there. Can't vouch for how good they are however."", 'Thanks for the tip!']"
121,PSA about Southwest's International Service in Emergencies,0,6yum72,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6yum72/psa_about_southwests_international_service_in/,6,1504904576.0,"As someone who flies a lot for work and typically flies Southwest, I was really excited to see them add international offerings and recently flew to Punta Cana for a short vacation. The first day we landed, Irma started to form so I contacted Southwest twice about moving my flight up so we could leave in advance of it getting near the Dominican Republic. We ended up booking a second earlier flight that would get us out of the country in advance of Irma reaching the DR.

Southwest ended up cancelling all service in and out of Punta Cana in the days leading up to Irma (I understand the safety argument, but the weather was fine there until the day of the hurricane and every other carrier flew in and out of the airport with the exception of  Thursday).

I called and was told there was nothing they could do as they only have one flight a day and they would be unable to put us on any other airline as they do not have agreements with them. We were told to ride out the hurricane and that they could get us on a flight in the days after it had passed.

Thankfully we were able to book on a separate airline, but Southwest has been totally unwilling to take any responsibility for the few hundred people they stranded there in the days leading up to the hurricane.  

It has been really frustrating especially after seeing some of the stories about Delta and Jetblue supporting their customers and I just wanted to make sure people were aware of the risks prior to booking with them (especially internationally).

TLDR: Southwest does not have the quantity of planes, infrastructure, or partner airlines to get you out of these international locations in the event of emergencies. Tread carefully before booking any of these flights since they have continually hid behind contract of carriage and refused to refund any of the expenses we had to fly out on a different airline. 
","['Why do people go to the Caribbean in the hurricane season, and then go on the internet to complain about there being hurricanes?', 'So let\'s see .. you chose to travel during hurricane season.\n\nYou whinge that an airline is concerned about safety.\n\nYou think the airline should take care of you because of ""acts of god"".\n\nSorry but this is all on you.', ""> Southwest does not have the quantity of planes\n\nThey have the largest all Boeing fleet of any US carrier.  So you're flat our wrong there.\n\n> Southwest does not have the infrastructure\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\n> Southwest does not have the partner airlines to get you out of these international locations \n\nWhile true, its just as true for their domestic flights.  They do not code share with any other airline, anywhere.  You'd be just as stuck in Florida when Irma comes through there.  This isn't news.  If you were unaware, that's on you, not the airline.\n\n> they have continually hid behind contract of carriage and refused to refund any of the expenses we had to fly out on a different airline\n\nAs if any other airline would pay or refund you to fly you on a non-partner airline?  This is what travel insurance is for.  Sounds like you cheaped out and didn't have any.  Not SW's fault that you planned poorly."", ""If it is coming across as complaining that really isn't how I intend it and it is probably because there is some residual bitterness from talking to Southwest over the past few days. I understood the risks when we left, and when I saw the weather changing I moved up my flight accordingly. I'm trying to get information out there that they have limited options for getting back and for people that frequently fly and enjoy Southwest (I was in that group and use them often), I would not encourage using them for international travel. This is something I wasn't aware of prior to using them for this trip and I wish I had known."", ""Not your post specifically, but just reddit in general the past few days.

She is having some nervousness about the flights, and I'm hoping to find some information for her to help calm her nerves.  I've never flown internationally, and I am finding my google-vue is not strong.  

Details:
Flying MCO to LAX 5/21; landing 9:33PM (Jetblue); 3.32 layover

LAX to PVG 1:05am-6am (China Eastern); 4.05 layover

PVG to OkA 10:05am-1:30pm (China Eastern) 


Return 3/31
OKA to PVG, arrival 3:55pm (CE); 5.05 layover

PVG to LAX 9pm-6pm (CE); 3.57 layover

LAX-MCO 9:57pm departure

Ok, a few questions.
1.  Will those layover times be enough for whatever she has to do at each stop?  

2.  She knows she has to collect her bag in LAX both ways, and recheck it.  Does she have to collect her bag in PVG either way or does it get checked all the way through because it's on the same airline?

3.  What does she do when she arrives at PVG?  Does she go through customs and immigration, even if she is never leaving the airport, and just going from one plane to another?  How does that work?

4.  Are there signs in English at PVG?

My return trip is exactly the same but in reverse.

Will I have to recheck bags once I switch airlines in Boston (or Dublin)? Or will my bags go straight to London? Will I have to go through customs in Dublin even if it's just a connection?

On your way there in Dublin you will have to go through immigration control as the UK and Ireland share an external border and you will land in Gatwick as if it were a domestic flight. Customs in Europe is different than the US, you do customs at your destination airport and just walk through the exit that is appropriate for you. There will be ""nothing to declare"" as a green lane (Choose this one), Goods to declare (choose only if you are importing something you need to pay tax on...I imagine you\'re not), or an EU arrival (don\'t choose this as you\'re luggage is coming from the US).\n\nDo note that, in general, on the return trip, you will have to collect your luggage at the first airport you arrive to in the US. That isn\'t an airline thing, but for US Customs that requires you to formally enter the country will all of your things in your possession.\n\nNow as this gets ever more complicated, Dublin is an exception to that ""in general"" and actually considered an airport where you can enter the US despite being in Ireland, but I don\'t believe you have to have your luggage with you. If the officer suspects an issue, they can have your luggage flagged and pulled for inspection (this is very unlikely to happen).\n\nIf you are all booked on a single ticket, that means you have a contract to get the entire way and if you are delayed and miss a connection, the airline has to pay for you to go the rest of the way (and depending on circumstances, pay for food, hotel, and sometimes even pay you a cash penalty), so don\'t worry about the connection time and you will formally cross the border into the US in Dublin and land in the US as a domestic flight. At that point you won\'t have to collect luggage and it will continue on to your final destination.\n\nSorry this is long, it\'s actually quite obvious and simple in practice, just follow the signage and it should be quite easy. Dublin just happens to be a very particular case, especially for connections from UK to US and vice versa, but in the end it makes it much more convenient.', ""My guess is that you're flying JetBlue BNA-BOS connecting with Aer Lingus BOS-DUB-LGW. If so, then JetBlue and Aer Lingus have interline agreements with each other, and so they will transfer the bags for you when you switch airlines in Boston on your outbound flight. \n\n(I am not sure about the implications on bags on flights between the UK and Ireland)\n\nWhen you're flying back, you will not pick up your bags in Dublin (but you will see a photo of your bag and you have to identify that is indeed your bag) since Dublin is a US pre-clearance airport. You will clear US immigrations in Dublin, which also means that you will not have to pick up your bag in Boston. When you arrive in Boston, there isn't any immigration, so simply go to your next gate."", ""If the whole thing is booked on one ticket your bags should go straight thrlugh, but make sure to check with the check-in attendant as some airports may require you to re-check your bags for security reasons.

My domestic flight to JFK was 1 hr and 45 mins late. Missed my connection with Turkish Airlines.

Turkish won't speak to me because it's Jet Blue's fault, but Jet Blue seems incapable of doing anything right.

Jet Blue rebooked me for a flight the next day. Refused hotel. I checked with Turkish after and they said I was confirmed for the flight. Slept in airport. Come in early. Turkish says I am on standby. Call Jet Blue. They say they had a computer glitch that deleted my reservation. They contact Turkish and Turkish says they can and will confirm a seat. Go to check-in, Turkish says I'm on standby still. Call Jet Blue. Jet Blue says Turkish has confirmed me but bumped me to accommodate a different customer. They say since the reservation was made by Jet Blue, so I have lower rank and can just get kicked off my flight. Other passengers who missed the connection are on the flight.

Stuck in airport still. Turkish won't talk to me because Jet Blue made the mistake. Jet Blue can book me on the same flight tomorrow, but judging by the number of missed connections I've seen today, the same will likely happen.

Need to get to Bangladesh. I'm wondering if I'll even get there before my return flights are booked.

Any help or suggestions? I would be so grateful!","[""To clarify, were these all booked on one ticket? Or did you book a flight on JetBlue and a flight on Turkish separately and missed your connection? Because if it's the latter, and it sounds like it is, you should be lucky that Turkish is helping you out at all, as the fault was entirely yours. If a 1h45m delay caused you to miss your connecting flight, you booked your flights too close together. If it's the former, they should be more aggressive about getting you onto another flight."", ""I don't know if JetBlue has the same powers as the bigger US companies but I've had Delta put me on an American and United flights before.

JetBlue's  job was to get him to New York, which they did just not on time. They technically aren't responsible for getting him another flight on Turkish. \n\nFuture lesson for OP, and one I learned the hard way, is to never book separate tickets for a trip unless they are all on the same airline or you're okay with having to wait a day or two in case something goes wrong with your connection.

Here's the itinerary I've come up with for now, leaving on August 24 and returning on September 4.

* August 25- CHS-FLL; JetBlue, arriving around 3PM. Travel to Miami airport on TriRail, check in around 6PM for an 8:30PM flight on LATAM to Santiago.
* August 26- Arrive in Santiago around 6AM. Meet up with my friend, check into hostel, explore the city (I've got a list of museums/neighborhoods/parks/etc that I want to see, but I'm open to suggestions!).
* August 27- Santiago.
* August 28- Santiago. Grab a late afternoon flight or overnight bus to La Serena.
* August 29- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory).
* August 30- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory). Overnight bus to Santiago.
* August 31- Arrive in Santiago early in the morning, grab a bus to Valpariso.
* September 1- Valpariso.
* September 2- Morning bus to Santiago.
* September 3- Santiago.
* September 4- Santiago, 2:30PM LATAM flight SCL-ASU-GRU-MIA (somehow, it was significantly cheaper this way).
* September 5- Arrive in Miami around 6:30AM. Need to be at FLL for a 6:30 JetBlue flight back to Charleston. Might be meeting a friend for part of the day, but I'm also interested in suggestions for a few hours in Miami.

I'm a 19 y/o guy, and outside of the flights (around $600, already paid), I'm budgeting around $600 for all else. I can increase that, but I'd really prefer not to.

I need to be in Santiago on both weekends so I can meet up with my friend and I'm dead set on seeing Valpariso, but I'm not sure if La Serena is worth the trip.

128,Frequent flyer miles programs?,13,hyuaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/hyuaa/frequent_flyer_miles_programs/,56,1308028712.0,"Hey all,

What frequent flyer miles programs do you use?  I'm looking into signing up for one because I'm going to be traveling from the SF bay area to the Boston area 3 or 4 times this year.  I won't be staying in hotels when I do travel, except when I go to PAX east.

I figured the best place to start my research would be Reddit, so here I am.  Got any programs that I should look into?  Any advice and suggestions will also help!  Thank you for your time!","[""FlyerTalk is a great resource as others have mentioned, but I look at things differently.  I'm mileage agnostic.  I always make sure to earn miles on any flight I take, but I don't pick my flights by mileage program.  So here's how I look at things.\n\nFor me, nonstop is generally worth it unless the comfort factor on a connection is going to be that much greater.  Where do you live in the Bay Area?  If you're in the east bay, then you might decide a connecting flight is better than a nonstop out of SFO.  But let's assume that you're in the City and would prefer SFO anyway.\n\nYou have three nonstop options:  United, JetBlue, and Virgin America.  On United, you have a lot of flights to choose from, but the onboard product is lacking.  You'll get movies on a screen overhead but there's no wifi and no power ports to juice up on the long haul.  If you do fly enough to become an elite member (25,000 miles a year), then you'll get access for free to Economy Plus.  That's effectively a coach seat with a few more inches of legroom.  (Note - while Aegean is great for getting elite status in the Star Alliance as mentioned by betterlate, you won't get Economy Plus unless you're elite in United's program.)\n\nOn JetBlue, it's a different story.  You get more legroom automatically (3 to 4 more inches than standard coach on just about everyone else) and you have LiveTV for free in your seat.  There are no power ports, however, and no internet.  So if you like to zone out and you're tall, this is probably the way to go.\n\nLastly, you have Virgin America.  That airline doesn't have great legroom, but it does have free TV as well along with powerports and wifi on every flight.\n\nIf you decide you do want to make decisions based on mileage programs, then there are a few things to consider.  United is a traditional program where you earn one mile for every mile flown and redeem at a flat amount.  You can redeem on United and Star Alliance airlines to go anywhere in the world, effectively.\n\nJetBlue and Virgin America are different.  You earn points based on how much you spend and then you redeem the same way.  The amount you redeem will vary depending upon the price of that flight if you just bought a ticket.  Redemption options are more limited as well, but JetBlue does have a much larger footprint in the Caribbean.\n\nThe suggestion to use Alaska is a good one as well.  Alaska partners with a lot of different airlines (including American and Delta) so you can earn in one place.  It's certainly something to keep in mind if you want to fly those airlines."", ""Depends on the airline you fly. If you're going to be flying Star Alliance (CO/UA/US/CA) then you should look at joining Aegean Air as it requires only 20k miles to get yourself Gold elite level. With 3-4 transcon flight you'd almost just make it though .. maybe another one or two flights.\n\nIf you're flying oneWorld, then I think AA is still your best bet as it has the cheapest redemption rate in the alliance.\n\nI don't think DL flies direct between BOS and SFO so that's out of the picture, not to mention SkyTeam is next to useless anyway. \n\nYour best bet: [FlyerTalk](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/)!"", ""I've carried balances on 5 different mileage programs; Delta, AA, South West, United and US Air. I held platinum exec on Delta for a couple of years and am currently platinum on AA.\n\nOut of all those different programs I've found Delta to be the best. Not only does AA suck as an airline, their mileage program is incredibly stingy. Delta seemed to get more bang for my buck and I was able to make status easier. I haven't really broken down AAs, but it seems to be have taken me twice as long to hit platinum on than Delta.\n\nWith Delta, I almost always was upgraded when there was availability, and I flew out of one of their most busiest airports (JFK). AA I rarely get upgraded out of DFW, and when I do, it deducts from some weird balance they keep track of. Delta doesn't keep a balance of your upgrades.\n\nLet me just reiterate, platinum on AA and I still think they're a god awful airline. Go for Delta if they fly often enough out of your local airport.\n\nOh yeah, go check out flyertalk."", ""Frequent flyers program are not really interesting (well, apart for the Mile High Club which has its rewards) until you reach the higher levels, which will not happen with 3 or 4 flights a year. So don't expect much.\n\nHowever, since it's free.. :) It really depends on the airlines you will probably use. As you're in the US, I would consider a program from a Star Alliance airline, as you will be able to earn miles from the following members:\n\n* United / Continental\n\n* US Airways\n\n* Air Canada\n\nDelta is also a choice to consider as it has a huge network in the US, but as a member of Skyteam it might be difficult to earn miles on other airlines of the alliance (as Delta is the only airline with domestic flights in the alliance).\n\n\nI hate American Airline so I won't recommend that."", '[deleted]', 'Alaska Air has a great mileage program.  They are a perfect fit if you are staying on the West Coast.  They do have flights to the East though but just to the major hubs like NYC, Boston, DC, Atlanta.', 'Tons of valid opinions out there. My take: I have a credit card that earns Aero plan miles for Air Canada. (Star Alliance) I pay for everything with this card. I got 2 tickets to Europe this summer for 60k points/miles. (MTL- Paris- Zurich-Nice-Zurich-MTL with AC and Swiss) This is coach. I may or may not get an upgrade since I will be with my son. \n\nJust find a credit card for which ever airline you will use most and use just that. ', ""Does anyone have experience with JetBlue's program?  I've been looking into their flights when I possibly would fly out, and they are the cheapest flights I've seen.  How does JetBlue rate as an airline, too?"", ""Are you planning on trying to earn more miles with credit cards? If you are responsible with credit, pay them off monthly, and have a good credit score you can boost your mileage accounts with big sign-up bonuses and through normal CC spend.\n\nAre you going to be flying on someone else's dime or paying for the flights yourself?"", 'At only 3-4 flights this year I wouldn\'t let the tail wag the dog - find which flights are typically cheapest, or go by airlines that you like already, and then sign up for their program. And sign up for any new program every time you fly with a new carrier, since they\'re free. If you fly 4 flights *every* year, that will probably get you status (25,000 miles/year is the usual), and *that\'s* why people join programs. You get better treatment, less lines, less fees, free upgrades, etc. But until you get status, I wouldn\'t stress about it.\n\nOthers have pointed out FlyerTalk; since I see you\'re tall, check out seatguru.com, and look at the ""pitch"" (distance between the seats) on the planes that typically go from SFO to BOS for the major airlines. That\'s why I like United over American Airlines.\n\nI see you\'re checking out JetBlue - the budget airlines do save some money and I don\'t mind them at all.

Now everytime I get jetBlue miles, they can be used on AA (and oneworld) as well.\n\nThat being said, Frequent Flyer miles really only benefit you if you travel internationally. I know friends who got direct flights for the cheapest amount of miles to London, Paris, Rome, Hong Kong, Tokyo, etc. (going economy), but domestically, the cheapest miles force you to connect through 4 different cities before your final destination. jetBlue is the only Frequent Flyer program that I know that actually will get you on a direct flight."", ""A few additional comments:\n\nOn United you can pay for Economy Plus, but they charge by distance so it will add substantially to your cost. If you really value legroom JetBlue wins by a mile. For overall flight experience I think JetBlue beats out the other non-stop options. \n\nIf you do fly JetBlue I'd recommend crediting the JetBlue miles on the SFO<->BOS route to AAdvantage if you like international travel (they have an agreement for select routes, including this one). Not because AAdvantage is such an amazing FF program (though it is better than average for the legacies and does give you access to OneWorld, a motley collection of airlines), but because JetBlue only has a handful of direct destinations from SFO and no major international options other than the Caribbean. \n\nReally though, crankyflier's advice is great, don't pick flights based on mileage programs, especially when you aren't flying enough to get status (not that low-level status is that useful anyways :-p)."", '**The** CrankyFlier is a redditor?!', ""Thank you for this information!  I definitely will save it. \n\nBut yes, I LOVE leg room (6 foot here).  And I've learned to zone out.  JetBlue is attractive to me because if I was planning to fly out in October, from SFO to Boston, it would only be around $360.  And technically, SJC is closer to me (I live in Santa Cruz) but I'm willing to go the extra miles to fly out of SFO.  \n\nEDIT:  I should also mention why I would want to fly out of SFO rather than SJC:  flights out of SFO are generally non-stop, and are cheaper.  SJC flights have huge layovers and cost a small amount more (around 30 to 80 dollars more)."", ""Woahhhhh.  \n\nI agree with you on everything, except AA's travel program being stingy.  It is one quadrillion times better than Delta or Star Alliance.\n\nIt takes some time to hit Platinum on AA, and when you do, you rarely get upgraded, and the AA planes are old as hell.  But the miles man.   The miles are worth so much more.\n\nOP, go online right now and do a search for traveling by award.  You will find that AA miles are almost always cheaper, usually by 50% or more, than using delta or star alliance.\n\nOn saturday, I'm flying to UK, then amsterdam, then israel, then going to jordan, then paris, then back to LA from LHR on american miles. \nI also have a ton of United miles, but it was going to cost me literally 2X in terms of miles, which I gather at the same rate right now.\n\n"", 'AA\'s mileage program is significantly better than Deltas.

It actually serves to limit the number of people seeking an upgrade, increasing your chances somewhat (assuming you are willing to pay). However, a lot of it depends on the routes you are flying.', ""Meh.

I've been lurking for years but only recently started actively participating."", ""Well, if you don't mind a redeye, JetBlue runs a single daily nonstop from SJC to Boston so it's always good to check the pricing on that as well whenever you're searching.  If legroom and nonstop matter, then I'd stick with JetBlue or United with Economy Plus depending upon which one comes out cheaper.  The Economy Plus upgrade on that flight tends to be $73 each way on United (unless you have elite status) or you can just pay $425 for Economy Plus for a full year when you fly."", ""Very cool, glad some one who's compared the two mileage values chimed in here.

My wife and I are flying to Canada for the FIFA Women's World Cup at the end of this month. We had bet on the US making out of their group in 2nd place, so bought a semifinal ticket to that game. Turns out the US finished 1st in their group. Stupidly, we didn't check game time in case this happened and will be in the air when the US are playing the semifinal (I'm assuming they'll make it there).

We know our flight is an Airbus 319 plane. I have also reviewed AA's site to try to figure out how the entertainment system on this plane works. I can tell that we can watch movies and shows for a price, but cannot tell if we can watch live TV and which channels would be available.

My questions are:
- Does anybody here know if live TV is available on these planes or flight? Exact flight is AA 1148, service from DFW to YEG.
- If there is, does it cut out once you cross over to Canada?
- Alternatively, is there decent wifi on this flight? Does that stay on beyond US borders?

I'm not really traveling far. I'm just going from California to New Hampshire and I'd like some advice.  
I've never traveled anywhere via plane, nor I have I gone on a trip alone. So, doing both the for the first time, at the same time, is a little more than intimidating.  
I have checked out the ITA matrix and I probably know where I'll be buying my ticket from there.  
I just saw that there is now a link to the beginners guide to airports, and I will be checking that soon. (It wasn't a link when I checked it a few weeks ago.)  
  
SO! My main question is:  
Are there any airlines I should avoid?  
I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?  
  
Any other tips that the beginners guide may not tell me?  
  
Any scams I should avoid? ie. ""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""  
  
I'll add more questions later, in the meantime any other advice you can give me from what I stated would be appreciated. If you have any questions for me I will answer them as soon as possible.  ","['You very likely can not take a bottle of water through security. You can however take an empty water bottle which you then refill once you are through security.\n\nIf possible travel with carry on luggage only. Check your airline\'s specific limitations. If you don\'t check a bag then you don\'t have to worry about it getting lost or damaged, you don\'t need to wait for your bag on arrival and you are much more likely to just get waved through security when you arrive (assuming there is security there, which there may not be as its a domestic flight).\n\nHave your ID accessible more or less the whole time. You will have to show it some number of times between one and infinity so don\'t show it once then put it away somewhere hard to get to.\n\nIt is better to get there early rather than late. By my thinking your holiday starts as soon as you arrive at the airport so arriving early is extra holiday time. Plus, once you are there you don\'t have to worry about being late.\n\n>I\'ll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don\'t have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?\n\nIs the multi-leg flight booked as the one transaction with one airline? If not they are very likely classed as separate flights so if the first leg gets delayed and you miss the second, that is just too bad. Either go non-stop or book a multi-leg flight in a single transaction.\n\n>""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""\n\nIt is expensive but its generally not bad.

There is also free DirectTV. All services that you'd have to pay for with a lot of other domestic airlines.

If you're worried, don't bring a guitar then. Their care is pretty much the same as any of the other big carrier's care. If it wasn't United last time, it'd've been Delta or AA. \n\n> My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) \n\nThey're all fine and pretty much the same. Someone once said that if you were blindfolded, ushered onto an airplane (and removed all logos and any hint of what airline you're taking), you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the big carriers: UA, DL, AA, US. \n\n> Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?\n\nIt doesn't matter much. If you decide for a connecting flight, just make sure you have enough time in between and you buy it on *one ticket*. Since you're flying domestic anyways, 1-1.5 hrs should be sufficient connection time. As long as it's all on one ticket and you've left reasonable connection time, then the airline is obligated to get you to your final destination.\n\n> Any scams I should avoid?\n\nSince you're flying domestic, you probably won't get a meal. Just eat at the airport. If you're leaving from SFO or LAX, there are some decent food options there."", ""United, Delta, and American are YMMV airlines. Sometimes the exp is great, sometimes it's awful.\n\nSpirit absolutely sucks, and I would avoid them at all costs.\n\nAlso check Southwest's site. They don't usually show up in flight search engines, and often their prices are much better, they have great customer service, and I think they still don't charge for checked baggage (at least 1 bag). I think I remember reading they're going to be charging soon, though.\n\nIt's usually cheaper to get food in the terminal and bring it on board, esp so for drinks. Just remember you can't bring liquids through security so buy them after security. Someone already mentioned you can bring an empty water bottle through and fill that after security. That's my usual trick in the US, too.\n\nITA is a good source, but I almost always find that http://adioso.com finds cheaper flights. Sometimes Skyscanner is better, but that's only happened twice for me.\n\nNonstop flights are usually much better. Some airports are not very enjoyable to spend time in. Also, if you have to change flights, your chance of having a baggage hiccup increase.\n\nWhen going to the airport, don't wear a bunch of jewelry or clothes with metal on them. You'll end up getting extra screening, which may mean getting groped by the TSA. Also, wear shoes that are very easy to remove and put back on since you'll probably have to remove them at the airport."", 'Thanks for posting!  There\'s nothing to be intimidated about.  Air travel is surprisingly easy and abundantly safe.  Some thoughts in response to your questions:\n\n* All of the airline options you presented are essentially the same, assuming that you only have carry-on baggage.  If you have to check a bag, JetBlue and Southwest will let you check one bag for free.  The rest charge about $25 for a checked bag.  However, [this handy-dandy-website](http://www.airline-baggage-fees.com/) keeps track of all baggage fee policies in one place.\n\n* If you are bringing a guitar, United is now probably the best airline to fly because they are acutely aware of the care they use with guitars due to all the bad PR they got with that.  \n\n* Nonstop flights are always a plus.  You get to spend more time at your destination.  And you can budget more accurately as you will not have a bunch of ""incidentals"" that you hadn\'t budgeted for when you have a 3 hour stopover (i.e. drinks, snacks, a magazine, a book, a gadget).  The benefit to many connections is a circuitous route that will net you more frequent flyer miles.  \n\n* [Everything you wanted to know about airplane food](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grace-mcclure/everything-youve-wanted-t_b_4421803.html).\n\nGood luck and happy travels!', ""My only tip (for beginners and seasoned travellers) is just to get to the airport early. It will definitely make it less stressful and things will probably work out better. If you have time to spare you can read or browse the web or walk around or whatever, but you'll be happy. Following that, once you go through security go directly to your gate. Once you've found it you'll know where it is, if there are any changes etc. and you'll be able to explore the airport freely. \n\nFinally, if you have any, any questions while travelling just ask an employee or even a fellow traveller and you'll get good advice!"", ""Hi, airline employee here! The most important advice I can give is never never book through a third party site like cheap tickets, orbitz, travelocity etc. I have herd of and seen so many mistakes, such as booking a person on an itinerary that wont work, not putting seat requests in, or not giving the airline contact info leaving you totally out of the loop of flights are delayed, changed etc. Once you book a ticket through these websites, most times the airlines cant make changes, and you have to call the company that issued the ticket, even if you are standing in the airport, and pay any fees they might charge. These sites are okay to get a general idea of the ticket price, but always book directly with the airline you will be traveling on. \n\nAlso, always look at the total travel time. While you might think you are getting a good deal by saving 50.00, you might also be buying an itinerary that has a 4 hour layover in Cleveland. \n\nFinally, airlines handle millions of pieces of luggage a day, and 99.9 percent of it makes it to where its supposed to go. However you can do some things to make sure your bags have the best chance of making it. Make sure your bag has a sturdy name tag. The little paper and elastic ones the airlines give are okay, but can get ripped off easily. Check the airlines bag allowance, most major airlines change 25.00 for a bag, but some like JetBlue and Southwest let you check a bag for free. Weigh your bag before you get to the airport. Most airlines have a limit of 50lbs. If you can, try and book a trip with the least amount of stops. Every time you have to get of the plane and transfer to a different one is another chance for your bag to get lost. \n\nAs far as airline choices, since you're going to New Hampshire if you want to go non stop I guess you'll be going to Boston? So for non stop flights your choices are American, Virgin America, United and JetBlue. If all the prices were the same and I had my choice, I would probably pick JetBlue since they have the most legroom, an important factor for us tall folks, you get a free bag, and you can fly out of Long Beach or LAX.  \n\nBut thats just all my opinion.

Ingoing Jetblue has the perfect time for me (and nonstop) but going back isn't the best on the return. Delta had better times on the return.

Using Google flights - it seems like I can get each for seperate for the same price as round trip using just 1 (400 using Jetblue or delta, or 200 there using Jetblue 200 back using Delta).

Is there totally acceptable practice? Is there anything I'm missing? Since it's the same price I was hoping it wouldn't be dumb to do that since it would be best catering to better times for flights.

I simultaneously searched other websites for the same package. I saw that JetBlue had the same exact package (same flights, same hotel, same hotel room, same dates) for about $80 cheaper. Having used Expedia many times in the past for flights, and being aware of their [best price guarantee](http://www.expedia.com/p/info-other/guarantees.htm), which promises to credit or refund the difference in price and provide a $50 coupon for a future booking, I figured I would go ahead and book with Expedia. I was a loyal customer, could get some rewards points, and essentially pay ~$130 less.
 
 
 
After booking, I refreshed JetBlue and saw the same package was still available, again for about $80 cheaper. I immediately submit the online application for their Best Price Guarantee, and attach the screenshots as requested. 36 hours later, I receive a confirmation that my application was received. Almost 2 full days after I submitted my application, I received a response that I was denied.

 A few issues. 

* They essentially checked 48 hours for an identical package with a cheaper price. Naturally, with the time that elapsed, packages will either sell out or go up in price.

* The claim that the hotel had no rooms available was false. I went back to JetBlue and ran 2 searches. If I searched for just the hotel, then there are no availabilities. If I searched for the package (flight + hotel), then the hotel is available.

* What also hurt my case was that their email is in a different time zone (or something). I contacted them ~1/04/15 2:52 AM, but their email confirming receipt of my application shows that I submitted it on Jan 5, 2015 11:54:50 AM. They could not understand this discrepancy when I brought it up.
 
 
 
I called the number they provided. I explained what I typed just above. They basically kept saying there was nothing they could do since it was determined that my claim was denied.
 
 
 
I emailed again, with additional screenshots depicting that rooms were still available. By this time, rooms with the view that I booked were sold out, but other rooms were still available. And, naturally, flight prices continued to rise. So, while I was not able to reproduce the package several days later, I will still able to address the 2 reasons they gave for declining my claim:

* package was available for a lower rate at the time of contact (evidenced by screenshot)

* rooms were available
 
 
 
Many emails later with attempts to use logic, they still declined my claim. I provided a PDF printout of the *initial* cheaper package as further proof (PDF was not an accepted format on the online application). I admitted I could not provide the same package at a lower price during each email exchange, but that is simply because prices rise with time, and rooms/tickets sell out. I asked what the point of a screenshot is if they will disregard it, and they basically cited the same reasons, but added:
 
 
> We do empathize with your situation and wish we were in a position to do more, however, we need to comply with the rules and restrictions of your reservation.
 
 
 
I called one last time today, asking about the cancellation policy since I had purchased insurance, and when I requested at least a travel voucher, the agent was able to give me a $50 one.
 
 
 
**TL;DR** - booked with expedia based on ""Best Price Guarantee"". I met all requirements and provided proof. They checked ~48 hours later, after prices rose and rooms sold out, and deemed that they could not determine the lower-priced package was available at a lower rate when I first contacted them.

And if so, at what points does the cost vs. miles savings not become realistic?

My flight will be from NYC to Portland, or possibly to Chicago (or both through the year) and it looks like the cheapest flights (or the ones with the fewest connections) are JetBlue and Delta (I think) but I might be able to pick up a United (where my miles are) flight for $50 more, or even $100 more, but will likely also extend my travel time and have a connection.

Thanks in advance!","[""Can't say I've heard of a formula or quick rule. Good questions to ask are:\n\n* what goal am I working towards with my miles?

For people that fly once a year domestically, just book the cheapest airline.', ""It depends for me. I value award miles (RDM) around $0.015 and elite miles (if I'm working towards status still) around $0.08+ as my average CPM in the past is around that.\n\nIf it's short-haul one-way, I usually don't bother. Especially if there's no elite bonus. So I flew CDG-MUC on AF and BRU-LHR on BA even though I primarily fly *A (UA to be specific).\n\nI'd pay a bit more for long-haul international because that's how I usually accumulate towards status. Last year I paid maybe $80 more on a $1k ticket to get 100% miles (instead of 0%) on TK.

Not real numbers, just a hypothetical example.) Unfortunately, Delta is notorious for having poor availability, United reduced the value of their partner awards by vastly increasing the number of miles needed for a premium cabin award on their (better) partners... And as previously mentioned, Delta has moved to a spend-based program already and United will do the same in March. Given their respective downsides, I would personally put a United mile at about $.018 and a Delta mile a little lower than that.\n\nPassengers without status in both programs will accrue miles at the rate of five miles per every dollar spent on airfare (not taxes and fees) so a typical domestic roundtrip award at the lowest level (25,000 miles) will require $5,000 in spend. Couple this with the lack of availability on DL and what I would generally describe as sub-par operations and passenger experiences on UA, and neither of these sound particular compelling -- especially if you would need to spend more or use a significantly longer routing (which won't earn any additional miles.)\n\nOne possibility is buying the ticket on Delta but then crediting to Alaska's Mileage Plan as opposed to SkyMiles. While less expensive tickets on DL no longer earn full mileage credit on Alaska, you will have to look at the booking code, the flight distance, and the fare to determine if you would earn more on Alaska or with Delta: http://www.alaskaair.com/content/mileage-plan/partners/delta.aspx"", 'My philosophy: an actual discount now is better than a promised discount later.', ""I'm not at an elite status yet, no.

I'm fairly comfortable with traveling itself, I just want to make sure I've covered all of my bases. I'm going to take a shot at finding a couch surfing host for those few days, otherwise I'll find a hostel (search tips / recommendations?).

I have a valid US passport, and will be traveling fairly lightly. I'm taking roughly $1k in camera gear (body, 2 lenses), but should I look into insurance anyway?

Some countries have conditions for tourists, e.g. no criminal record. \n \nYES to travel insurance! It\'s one of those things...you probably won\'t need to use it- I hope you won\'t have to use- but if you do you have it. \n\nBe aware that your VISA card issuer will charge a % of transaction for use overseas per your cardholder agreement.  Be sure to call your card issuer and ask about the % and let them know the dates you\'ll be traveling and where so they don\'t freeze your account for suspected fraud. \n\n Most of the Caribbean islands are happy to accept USD. I\'ve never had an issue making purchases in cash. But I tend to stay in the ""touristy"" areas. Which side of the island are you going to visit- the Dutch or the French side?  \n\n Most cell phones and smart phones sold to North American customers can make calls no problem in the Caribbean.  Sounds like you\'ve found a good option with your sim card to avoid international charges.  Let me know if it works because I go on cruises and I wonder if that would be cheaper than the rate for Cellular at Sea. I\'m a travel agent, too.  This could be an excellent option for my clients. \n\nAs far as places to see on St. Maarten-  Maho Beach!! is one of those cool things to do- there\'s a sandy beach at the end of the runway for Princess Juliana Airport. The approach brings planes in right over the beach goers\' heads- approx 30 feet for the jet liners.  And then there\'s the take-offs.\n\nYou can ferry over to St. Barts, too.

Literally hours of negotiation and MANY escalations to the next higher up manager led to us getting a room like we reserved, but we had to switch rooms during the visit.  Atlantis thought it was ok to ask me to check out of one room by 11, take my bags to the bell desk, have no room until 3 or 4 and check in again.  I raised a stink and we got to stay in the one room until the other was ready.  Stupid.  Lots of other really poor service with no apologies or empathy.
