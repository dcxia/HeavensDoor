0,JetBlue Gateway Select Program Questions/Discussion,5,ci891a,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/ci891a/jetblue_gateway_select_program_questionsdiscussion/,55,1564202703.0,"This post was originally in the r/aviation thread but it was archived and locked. I have decided to relocate it here. Seemed more appropriate anyway!

That being said if you have any questions about the program feel free to post here! There are plenty that are in the program that would happily answer your questions. I included! If you are in the process of the application/acceptance into the program feel free to post your progress!

I want to cultivate an environment of support, helpful information, and encouragement to any and all those interested in the program. So please questions related to JetBlue and the Gateway Select program itself. Any comments posted to turn people away and attack the program will be deleted. So please be courteous and good luck!

*I will be monitoring and checking this post frequently. Also feel free to IM me personally for questions as well I would be happy to help!*","['First question I want to ask is; now that the application process is completed who all will be part of the October class and the February class?

That seems to good to be true. Or is it only for pilots through the gateway program', 'Isn’t the February class for applicants from December/January or are you allowed to choose a flexible class starting time ?', ""Hi! I got in too, finished up 1st class medical.   I'm pinned for the October class. \n\nWas wondering, will jetBlue provide the flight going to JBU? or not?"", ""I just applied within this application period that closes on September 20th. Most of my questions seemed to be answered after looking into the program for a while but I haven't seen anyone talk about the living situation in Arizona? I understand its taken care of in the tuition but what's the living situation there and how far is it from the training facility?"", 'What is the time frame they are telling you to actually be on the seniority list starting indoc at Jetblue?', ""A bit late to the party but I do have a question if anyone is still here. I applied on the 26th of September because the JB site said it was open application until the 30th, but the FAQ on their site says the application window closes the 20th. Idk if anyone can tell me if the extended the window or not, but if anyone has some past experience with applications I'd like to know how long it takes for JB to get back to you on first round selections. Appreciate the help and wish me luck!"", ""I applied on September 24th.  The only thing I seen that had me guessing is I received an email stating they appreciate the interest and they will contact at a later date.  Email seemed normal but when I went back in to just check on the application status it shows nothing, like I didn't even apply for anything, that has me wondering."", 'Ya you don’t get seniority at the start of the program that is for sure. No airline union would allow that. So guess it’s after you actually start ground school with a new hire class.', ""All signed up for the assessment.

As far as I know, there have been 3 people who were accepted but couldn\'t finish. I think I\'ll take a different route to see if I could make it to the majors faster with little to zero debt compared to the Jetblue\'s Route. Keep in mind the entire process could take 9-12 months just to be accepted.', 'Only those who have gone through the program. Otherwise goodluck, you’ll be at a regional for like an additional 1500 hours or the military.', 'I applied in January and I was a bake to just October as my start time. I think it is just first come first serve when you want to start.', ""Hey, congratulations to you and to all who have been accepted. I also went to the Interview and thought that I did pretty okay, however, I haven't heard a peep on whether or not I got accepted. In any case, it's an experience I'll never forget and I'll just use it as motivation towards my future endeavors. Again congrats and much success to you all.\n\nEdit: Quick update, I am ecstatic to say that I received an email today. I am accepted to the program. I would like to thank the OP for starting this forum and to let future candidates know the process is long but stick through it and be positive through it all. If you look down you cannot go up and in this case, up will be an opportunity to fly for a great company as Jetblue. No matter the decision, I would still be truly thankful for the entire process with no regrets.

One of the tests is apperently mock simulator where you have to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to fly a plane to some rings while paying attention and keeping track of what people are telling you, how many times you hear a buzzer, how many planes you see, where you see the airport is, etc. Like I said this is just stuff I saw online but I\'m sure if you just do some basic review of the fundamentals you should be fine.\n\nEdit: spelling', 'Would like to know the same thing.', 'I received mine at 12:30 MST.

As the program expands, more news about it comes out.\n\nFrom my experience making over $100,000, personally, there is no way I personally could pull off paying that much in four years. I do not know the deductions at JetBlue's payroll but with taxes and other said deductions, payroll deductions will put a significant dent in earnings. After the 4 mandatory taxes( unless you live in a state with no state taxes) you have Medical, dental, vision, 401k, life insurance better not get married or have children or your chances of( child support, alimony ) coming out your deductions increases.\n\nIf Jetblue offered tuition reimbursement as it should be then this program would be the best bar none."", 'This pertains to EASA. Which is much different. Americans are not eligible for this program. Other ab initio programs are out there, Cebu Pacific Airline in the Philippines is another one that I can think of.

I was hoping to apply to the position when there’s an available spot but if they are getting less than minimum wage I’d rather focus my attention elsewhere thank you.,"['I mean they can’t get paid below minimum wage afaik. NYC is $15/hr for all workers including tipped, correct?', 'exactly why I’m so confused, but I also read somewhere that airports don’t have to follow the minimum wage laws.

So in NYC it’s $15', 'Ah okay, do you have a source to where you got this information?', 'I have friends that work for JetBlue in NYC at JFK.', 'Ah okay, and what positions are minimum wage there and which aren’t (if you know them specifically).', 'Because of the airline industry and having to pay more. Pretty much you’ll be minimum wage. Airport Operations and Ground Operations will be the same.', 'Ahh that’s a shame']"
2,12 Hour Delay,3,dj3cnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/dj3cnd/12_hour_delay/,2,1571329358.0,"First time posting, On Mobile. Hope this is the right place to post, sorry for formatting, spelling, grammar, etc. 

So I'm currently sitting in the Denver Airport, settling in to spend the night here until 10 am. 

My flight was suppose to leave at 11:59 pm on Oct 16. But instead a pilot called in sick, apparently only an hour before the flight was suppose to leave and without the second pilot we are unable to leave. 

From my understanding, they attempted to find another pilot but we're unable so now they have to fly in a new crew in the morning. 

So instead of meeting my connecting flight at 6am. I now leave here at 11 am, reach the connecting airport at 430 pm and then get on my new connecting flight at 1030 pm to reach my destination 13 hours later then I originally was suppose too. 

I picked JetBlue because I've previously had no issues with them, in fact my next flight in Nov is booked with them. Something which I regret and I'm almost thinking of cancelling and rebooking with any other airline. 

And tbh, I'm not entirely angry because of the delay. It's frustrating and annoying but what really gets me, is the refusal to get people a place to stay. This isn't a 3 hour delay or even a delay during the day where people have access to transportation, food, etc. It's 2 am and most of us don't live here. We have no place to stay. 

But Hey, at least I got a meal voucher for $8 that doesn't work at McDonald. That I can't use until the restaurants open in like 6 hrs. So ill starve instead.  /s

Update: spent the night at the airport and got my flight in the morning. But now my connecting flight was canceled. And I'm stuck.","['Super frustrating, sorry this happened to you. It’s the same reason I choose to fly JetBlue, it doesn’t happen often.\n\nFor what it’s worth you are entitled to a $250 credit, they apply that to your accounts with JetBlue but I believe if you demand that in cash, they will comply.

Carry it on the plane, they may consider it a personal item so try to coordinate that everyone has one roller bag and a personal item.

Were returning today and hoping to find an alternative solution if not.  Thanks!', 'Yes the flight was full and it still fit in the overhead just fine for home safe and sound with it.

We will be doing the Litesaber experience in November in Disnyworld. \n\nDid they enforce that that was your personal item? Usually we don’t check our luggage...so we each have a roller suitcase and a backpack. Will they also allow the Litesabers you think?', ""That's hard to say We had one checked bag that we put the majority of our clothes in for our family of 4 and then 4 roller bags + 3 backpacks so it just took the place of our 4th backpack.

I tried contacting customer service but they gave me a lot of conflicting information in the chat and I honestly am nervous to trust what I was told because I don’t think the agent really knew what they were talking about. 

Has anybody had a similar experience? What happened?","['I’m not sure why customer service couldn’t give you a straight answer. You SHOULD be able to do this fine. You can cancel your seat and get a refund IF you change the flight or cancel the original flight. Where you would lose it, is if you stayed on the original flight, and chose to go to another seat (no even more space). Call 1-800-jetblue and they should be able to do it. \n\nJust know.

My only fear is that the refund wouldn’t happen or that it would be account credits not an actual refund.', 'By there own policy. If you change or cancel the flight (since this is round trip, it would probably need to be both), then you would get a return in the same form paid. So it should go back to the card.

Why would you board ppl if you are not ready to leave!!!!!!!!!  It’s starting to get uncomfortable.  And there is no communication to the passengers from the crew other than “missing paperwork”.   I (who is not on the plane) knows of the departure time change before my family member on board. 

They are even saying that you can onboard but only to grab another flight. WTF!!!!!  Ppl from jetblue. Get you shit together and communicate with those passengers. Is now 11:00 and those doors are open!!!

Update 11:15pm:  Door is still open and now they will begin with the service of drinks and snacks (no alcohol, geez). 

And they said that because they started the service, the plane cannot leave the gate until the full service is completed and put away safely. 

Or you might say, buying time.

Update 11:33pm: Still at the gate. But crew just informed the passengers “Our supplies are extremely limited”. More than two hours at a gate you would expect that there is plenty of time to restock. Doors till open.

Hello. From my own redemptions and from reading the various bloggers, I've always thought of JetBlue points being worth around 1.3¢ each. My last redemption, though, was only 1¢ (a nearly-full Mint flight). I'm pricing out a trip right now between JFK and Phoenix at Christmastime and seeing the same thing – my points are worth 1¢ versus the cash fare. Is there some rhyme or reason to this? It's really annoying for these points to be worth 30% less than I've been thinking they were worth... What am I missing here?","['Value depends substantially on flight length and seat.  It is possible to get 2 cents per point.  Shorter flights at front of plane generally redeem at a better value than long flights in the back.

Should I use my points to buy a ticket now, or am I better waiting until closer to the flight itself? Do the point prices just match the money prices? ","[""JetBlue point prices track the cash prices at a rate of (very close to) 1.4 cents per point, eg a $500 cash ticket will be priced at about ~35,700 points. If the cash price goes up or down, the points price will go up or down to keep that same ratio.\n\nSeptember is so far away right now, the price they're offering is probably their rock bottom, and it's unlikely to move at all for a few months - but when it does, it's virtually guaranteed to move up, not down. Prices really only drift down after they've already skyrocketed upwards in the few weeks before a flight.\n\nThis is _especially_ true if you're flying JFK<->SFO or BOS<->SFO, which are two of the most competitive routes in the country. As a result, airlines compete _very_ closely on price and the inventory is managed so carefully that there tends to be very little price fluctuation at all. JetBlue (and all the others) know that if they ratchet up the price on this route, other airlines will be perfectly happy to sell you the ticket at the current low rate instead. So buy the ticket, cross it off your list, and move on to worrying about other things.\n\nbtw, Sept 2 is also the Sunday before labor day, which means prices may be a good bit higher this weekend than others. That's not going to change unless they suddenly reschedule the holiday, though, so waiting to buy this ticket won't save you any money.\n"", ""Keep in mind that reservations made with points are refundable. If the price goes down you could technically cancel your reservation and book again.

My friend Kate has been booking vacations through an acquaintance Judy who's friend Charles works for Jetblue corporate. Charles sends Judy these insane vacation deals and Judy passes them on to her friends. When I say insane, I mean like 7 day, all inclusive Caribbean trips (to major resorts) for like $600 including flights and airport transfers. Judy requires cash for the trips, apparently sends the money to Charles who books the trips using his corporate card. The trip vouchers are good for 2 years and you can cancel a booked trip up to 30 days before for a full refund. The prices drop even more if 10+ tickets are purchased.

Something just doesn't seem right. It seems too good. Kate says Judy has be ""doing this for years"", has been a member of the community for 30 years and if she was scamming people, it would be known. I don't know anyone personally that has actually taken a trip but Kate has her first one coming up in November. I know 3 others taking trips in the next few months.

Kate asked if this was a timeshare thing and would need to sit through a presentation, Judy said no. Again, I would believe this more if that were the case. For this price, there has to be a catch.

Kate has purchased 4 vacations but my skepticism now has her nervous. If Judy were to get hit by a bus tomorrow, how would all these people reach Charles to book there trips or get refunds? How can Charles just book vacations for all these people? If you show interest in a trip, Judy jumps right on it and then you need to give her money immediately for this great deal.

If you want to change planes on to another JetBlue flight you have to recheck bags yourself and they won't transfer them.

Is this something that's changed, or is it still the case?","[""Yeah, JetBlue will always be a point to point and it's drastically different than how legacies run their operation. This is not saying there aren't *any* connecting flights. It just minimizes it.\n\n Really how it works is they setup shop with a 'focus city' and then just spin off a ton of destinations from that city and that's it. Point to point. Instead of routing you through hubs to get you to where you need to go. But to keep the network strong there are connections between the focus cities because one might have a destination you need to get to. There's pros and cons. The biggest con being that JetBlue can't afford to fly everywhere and anywhere like a large carrier. Yet, even on jetblue there's example of  connecting flights. For example if you live in NY and want to get to Dallas on Jetblue the only way to do so is to go from JFK to BOS then from BOS to DFW.\n\nJetBlue does work like any other airline. So if you book a connecting flight (under one PNR number) and you checked bags you can always expect that it will be moved over to  the other jetblue flight. If you booked two flights for the same day and it's not under the same PNR I would expect you'd have to recheck.\n\nHere's some people that mentioned it going far back as 2008:\n[source](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k1885390-Jetblue_Connecting_Flights-Air_Travel.html)"", ""Their network and operations allow for connecting flights, and they'll definitely sell you one, but the price becomes inflated by that point and most people will shop elsewhere for a direct flight rather than connect with JetBlue.\n\nLuckily for them (or perhaps by design), a great many East Coast passengers want direct flights within that time zone or to the opposite coast. People fill planes from JFK to Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale, and from Boston to LAX. But if their customer base were more oriented toward the Midwest or the Rockies, they wouldn't be able to offer a competitive and direct flight to Denver or Kansas City.""]"

I planned to book a flight from JFK to BOS (flight B6118) which departs JFK at 1:49 PM; however, the flight that I booked to JFK (OZ222) will arrive at 11:50AM and I have to go through immigration, customs, etc. So the question is will I be on time for B6118? Any comments are welcomed!

PS. I have to arrive at Boston before 5PM","['Way more than enough time. ', ""Possibly too late for your planning purposes, but be aware that many/most flights to or from BOS have been delayed for the past month, and this will likely continue until Sept. It's due to runway construction. The later your flight is in the day, the more likely it is to be delayed. "", 'Even though I have to go through immigration, customs, etc?']"

Because the whole flight was full -only the even more space seats were available- I did not choose any seats. I then added the boarding pass to the wallet on my phone. The boarding pass has a ""N/A"" on Seats. Does that mean that they'll accommodate me on an even more space seat without charging me, accommodate/force me to choose and pay for the even more space seat option or not fly at all? ","[""Assuming there are only Even More Space seats available when you arrive at the airport, you'll be assigned an Even More Space seat at no charge. If you want to increase your chances of getting an Even More Space seat, check the seat map before checking in with an agent to ensure there are only EMS seats open and/or go to the airport early to get an EMS seat assigned before anyone changes their seat (and potentially opens up a regular Economy seat).

Went to book the next day and it's more than double the price. There are still plenty of seats left. Is it likely to come back down?,"[""It isn't likely. Generally the pricing structure works in such a way the fewer seats that are available in that price group result in a higher price.
