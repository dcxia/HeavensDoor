JetBlue Airways confirmed what anyone who has shopped for airlines tickets lately already knew: the airline, like its competitors, has been aggressively raising fares to offset sharply higher fuel costs. 

Airlines executives are often reluctant, at least publicly, to admit that tickets prices are on the rise, using industry jargon like ?improving yields? to talk about the fare climate.

St. George said jet blue led ?several? successful industry fare increases in the July- September quarter and also led the industry?s baggage fees higher.

In late August, JetBlue became the first major airlines to hike baggage fees. The new charges will be $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for second checked bag, up from $25 and $ 30. Alaska airline?s bag fees are due to increase in December. 

Airlines are able to pass along fuel costs because travel demand is strong from business travelers and vacations. On united airlines? quarterly conference call last week, President Scott Kirby, called it ?one of the best revenue environments we?ve ever seen.?"

"cu8hxw"|"AirCanada Travel Story"|"Dear Diary ? err Air Canada,
On Wednesday August 21, 2019, I left Regina for Toronto at 6:40am(ish), I arrived in Toronto about 3 hours later, I was filled with hope. 
The flight was supposed to be leave at 2:50, I would be back in Jersey for 4:20, and it would be easy to train the train from Newark airport, to my place in Waldwick, NJ. 
That flight got delayed until about 4:45, but alas, they still boarded the plane, telling us about 10 minutes later, hey guys, its going to be an hour due to a ground stop ? okay, just an hour on this hot plane, nothing to---- ?Excuse me passengers, they have cancelled this flight? ---- shhhiiii?
So rebooking occurs, initially wanting to throw me in for Friday at 6:40am, here I am knowing I need to get back to work by Friday, thinking that won?t do, so I manage to get squeezed in for Thursday at 6:50; not ideal, but hey, it could be worse.
Me thinking, well the flight was cancelled because of weather, but was delayed because of AirCanada own problems in Chicago trying to get the plane here, and then apparently having to find a different plane for us to take to Newark ? but hey, AirCanada doesn?t take responsibility, sure that delay was our fault, and had we been on time we would have been the storm system, but we screwed up, got here late, and had to cancel because of it ? but we will blame the weather, lest we comp a hotel room for a guy. So what can I do, it?s a late flight out, I can?t be at an airport all night, all day and all afternoon waiting for the evening flight ? guess I will have to fork out money for a hotel. 
Then, all day Thursday, I am tracking the storms, thinking they gotta cancel, they gotta cancel, but 6:20 comes around, Air Canada boards us, and then we sit on the runaway for 30 minutes, I am thinking, here it comes, we are getting cancelled we are getting?and we are taking off? We get 20 minutes away from Newark, when I see we are doing circles in the sky ? this is normal, Newark sometimes makes you hang out for another 30-45 minutes, they won?t make us ? ?Excuse me passengers, we are being told to hold for 3 hours, and we don?t have the fuel to do that, so we are going back to Toronto?
Shiiiiiiii
Land, sorry bro, can?t get you to Newark tomorrow, or Saturday; can get you to Laguardia though? 
Me?well if I take the bus from LaGuardia to the subway terminal in Jamaica, then the subway to Penn Station in Manhattan, then NJ Transit to Secaucus and finally NJ Transit from Secaucus to Waldwick, I can get home tomorrow? Guess we are going for ?Attempt #3: LaGuardia Edition?
2 cancellations, what does AirCanada say? Sorry bro, weather.  
Here?s hoping when regulations go into play, some MP puts a clause in saying you can?t blame weather, if the original screw up that delayed a flight long enough for weather to be an issue, makes it still your fault. 
P.S. JetBlue is the best airline in North America, and if it ever goes to Canada, you and WestJet will have to be better. When they were delayed by WEATHER for 8 hours, what did they do? Come out, give us their selection of snacks, which is much better than the pretzels AirCanada stocks, and bottles of water, because that?s what a good company that cares about its customers does."

"9ph36y"|"Alaska Airlines Is Latest to Hike Bag Fees, Matching Competitors."|"The Seattle-based carrier plans to raise baggage fees for tickets purchased on or after Dec. 5.

Alaska will charge $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for the second, in line with new prices at JetBlue, American, Delta and United, according to a new fee chart on its website. JetBlue set $30 and $40 as the new industry benchmark when it hiked its fee in August.

Alaska passenger face a bigger increase in the charge for a second bag than passenger on other airlines because Alaska has been charging $25 for the second checked bag, compared with $35 before the increase as other carriers.

Alaska is also increasing the price for a third checked bag, to $100 from $75. That is still below the $150 fee charged by American, United and delta.

Overpacking will cost Alaska passengers more, too. The airline increased the fee for an overweight bag to $ 100 from $75. All bag fees are each way, per person.

Southwest Airlines are the only U.S. carrier offering free checked bags. Passengers are allowed to check two bags for free. Weight and size limits apply."
"98lm2m"|"Double booked, only one charge..."|"So I was just trying to book a flight with JetBlue. I got to the lady screen, hit confirm, and got an error message. Tried a couple more times to no avail. Tried on the app, same deal. Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed.
Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.
Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts. Not from a morality stand point, thank you; I can make that decision myself and don't need the internet's thoughts on right and wrong. I'd like to hear if anybody knows how this will play out. Thanks!

"7ewvkv"|"Help! What to do with American Airlines gift card?"|"My boyfriend's mom gave him a $500 American Airlines gift card for his birthday a couple years ago. We would love to put it towards a vacation, but the trouble is, American Airlines is so ridiculously overpriced, we simply cannot justify it. For example: we want to plan a small getaway to San Francisco. A non-stop, round-trip ticket from Long Beach to San Fran on Jet Blue is $80. On American Airlines, it's $300-$500, or $200 leaving from LAX, for a 5 hour flight with one stop! How could we possibly justify buying those tickets? We've looked up countless destinations, and it's always the same problem: the prices are 2x, sometimes 3x, the price of other airlines! The other problem is, we could put the gift card towards a more expensive flight, but then we'd end up paying the same amount we would otherwise on a different airline, after the gift card. It's just impossible to justify! ??

Is there something about American Airlines that we're just not aware of? Is there a reason why it's so expensive? Unfortunately, the gift card is only for flights, not for hotels. It's the worst gift card ever! What would you do? Are there certain destinations that are cheaper?"

"7ac8ox"|"Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it..."|"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?"

The only reasonable flights are flying Frontier to and between Frontier, US Airways, and American Airlines flying back. I've only ever flown JetBlue before, and have only ever had good experiences with them.

My question is, basically, how are your experiences onboard with those airlines? Like, with JetBlue, you get free snack and beverages, and are also able to watch tv. Although, those things are not important to me, but they definitely make the trip more comfortable.

My friend(who is a huge enthusiast of anything aircraft and also works at an airport) recommended Delta over American.

This is the second time I've had the problem, the first time I called and made the reservation on the phone.  This time I'm just taking a different airline, and I replied with a ""Goodbye"" email.

It turns out that, despite their website saying they support Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, according to their email the site only works in Explorer.  Here is what they said:

> Please be sure that you are using Internet Explorer as your browser, when accessing www.jetblue.com.  Safari and Firefox work adequately but not as dependably as Internet Explorer. Please avoid using Google Chrome, as due to computer capabilities this can give you unexplained an untraceable errors.

Here is my reply - perhaps I was harsh, but I generally like flying Jet Blue, they are the only airline that flies out of the nearest airport to me, so it's disappointing.  I will add that neither Firefox nor Chrome worked.

>I thought this might be the problem.  I tried using your site with several different browsers and it was broken with all of them.

>First, even the US Government is recommending that people stop using Explorer due to flagrant repeated security issues.

>Second, I don't use Microsoft machines at all.  I don't have anything that will even run Explorer.  And neither does an increasing proportion of the flying public.

>Third, Explorer is slow, not standards compliant, and if you ask your web team they will tell you is so broken that 1/2 their time is spent making accommodations for the failure of Explorer to work like EVERY OTHER BROWSER.  That is, unless your web team is so amateurish that they are doing nothing BUT Explorer.  That is an approach that even a three-person startup company no longer uses.

>If Jet Blue insists on continuing to be Explorer centric, I will be forced to stop flying Jet Blue.  As far as I have found, you are the only airline that has this old, lame, stupid approach to the web. I'm sorry this is necessary - I like flying Jet Blue but if I can't make reservations I can't fly.

"2i4gv4"|"Dear, Reddit family. I pray no one fly United ever again!"|"Why I will never be flying United Airline ever again, no longer referring and urging friends and family to never fly with them again as well. Now here?s why, May 31?st 2014 I booked myself a flight from SNA ?John Wayne? to SEA ?Seattle? for October 3rd 2014 along with this so called ?insurance?. Why I booked this flight was due to an event I am attending and I thought it was a great deal ?at the time?. A month had past and some information was given to me by my peers informing me I should switch the fight to October 2nd and be there a day early as I am needed this day. Well immediately I contact United and was informed of their terrible policy in changing flights with all their outrageous fee?s and fare changes. I was informed to contact the insurance company as they should be able to handle this for me. Well this insurance company had no connection with United and had failed to mention that it is only for the event of an illness or unexpected emergency ?would be nice if they provided this in details (not just in the fine print) before purchasing?. So I contact United again ?mind you this is still about 3 months or more ago? and asked what my options where. I was told I can call 24 hours before the flight and pay a flat fee of 75.00 dollars to switch fights under same day. I thought ok I can do this but to protect myself I continued to search other flights and found JetBlue had a non-stop from Long beach to Seattle for 100.00 bucks. How could I say no right? So I contacted United again to verify and was informed by a second person that yes that?s correct. 24 hour same day is a flat 75.00 dollars. So I clearly said ok I will just do that option. The months have now past and one week ago September 26th 2014 I contacted United again to verify that this really is happening and I could be changing my flight 24 hours in advanced to the exact same flight a day prior ?well 26 hours to be exact? and was informed ?YES it is 75.00 dollars and I would change it for you now if I could? I was told. I thought awesome this will be fine, I?m only going to spend 75.00 extra and get there a day early. 48 hours before my flight, I call United again to verify and low and behold I?m given the ?no sir that is incorrect? ?you cannot change your flight for 75.00 dollar?s, you must pay 200.00 change fee plus airfare at 151.00 for a total of 351.00?? Excuse me??? My months and weeks of calling to making sure THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN has HAPPENED. I was in shock so I ask to speak to a manager. Well Mr. Manager gets on the phone and we get to the break down. Well it all gets broken down to that YES you can get that flight for a fee of 75.00 dollars, phew. Well here we are October 2nd 2014. I Call this morning about 30 hours before my flight to verify and am told ?YES you will be able to get on the flight for 75.00 dollars bur we can?t do it for you yet? I asked if it?s best for me to do it at the airport and the gentleman informed me that YES that would be best. (26 hours before my flight) I arrive at SNA and go straight to the counter and am greeted by a nice lady, I give her the whole spiel why I?m here and she looks at me confused. I am now told ?no, no the 75.00 dollar change fee is only for same day. You will now have to pay a 150.00 dollar change fee and airfare?? WHAT??? Well ladies and gentlemen I am speechless. I would get nothing out of this women as she is typing away and not even looking at me. I request my papers back and call United AGAIN, and finally someone within the States answers. I give the WHOLE run down of what has happened and why I am now at the airport looking like an idiot. I am told by her that (with attitude mind you) ?oh your fare doesn?t qualify for the 75.00 dollar change fee, I don?t know why you were being told this...? WAIT WHAT? What am I to do now? I need to get to Seattle like NOW! Here is what my answer was and the option I was given ?pay the change fee?s OR WAIT FOR IT? I can pay a 75.00 change fee for a different flight the next day?.? WOW I am in shock. Didn?t she just tell me my fare was not allowed for the changed fee but now it is on another flight? Well let?s just say United has done NOTHING for me other than get me to Seattle a few hours earlier by paying a 75.00 change fee? Guys and Gals, I urge you all too please rethink before EVER flight United. They are crooks, liar?s and thieves. No one knows what they are talking about and all they want to do is take your money and provide poor service.

"75iu0s"|"Jetblue gateway select program details"|"This post will detail my experience with the application process (and hopefully even further).

Found out about gateway select earlier this year, couldn't find much info on the process as I researched (found two helpful posts on r/flightsim and r/flying). Obvi it started in 2016 so there isn't much info to be found other then what's on the web page (http://pilots.jetblue.com/gateway-select/training). 

Submitted my application, resume, and cover letter Sept 24 2017.
Received an email on Oct 4 stating I've been selected for the next round of the application process.
This involved signing up for a $160 aptitude test at a testing center and to have the test completed by Oct 15. Just returned from that test and decided to make this post as I went in to it blind. You've got three hours and 4 test segments:

1. Multitasking: watch and interact with a flight sim, with limited direction on what the test comprises of. Keep track of audio directions (and how many individuals give you those directions), keep track of how many times there is a chiming noise, keep track of how many times a red light turns on. You also will have to click a button everytime you see air traffic or pass over a waypoint (you will be asked at what point you saw the helicopters and what the last way point looked like). While all this is happening you use the up and down arrows in a mini-game where you navigate a plane past oncoming rectangles. AND you have a few seconds to assess and answer quick math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition questions. The Sim ends and you answer the questions about how many chimes and how many people, what the last check point looked like, how many aircraft you saw, where in the route was the airfield, what the cockpit looked like and where the guages were. You make an assesment of how hard all that was and rate yourself on how well you did. Then you do the sim again. Slightly different, except this time you know what you're looking for.

2. Math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition:
Worst math was an algebra question (something like, (y-12)?14=9). Spacial reasoning and pattern recognition are timed events, gotta be quick to answer or it counts as wrong.

3. Reacting to confrontation:
Questions like ""you see a couple arguing, the woman is trying to get away but the man has a hold of her arm and keeps pulling her back. Do you A B C or D?"" All the questions were how you'd react in a confrontation either involving you or getting involved with others.

4. Personality test:
Basic personality test. Questions like ""I work well with others."" ""Individual performance is more important then group success."" Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree.

The test results come back same day via email.

Next up will be a phone interview if they like the test results.
After that is an in person interview.

Will post as I move thru the process. 
This is an informative post about the process; discussions on program details and cost exist on other threads. Have not seen anything detailing NDA on what the test is made of. Dm me if this violates any policy that may jepordise my applicant eligibility.

I've always wanted to try out jetBlue's Mint service since I've heard and seen so much about it, but I never had the opportunity to do so until now. I will be traveling cross-country for business in June, and have the option of starting from JFK or from LAX. The problem is that I can only afford to fly Mint on one leg of the journey.

That is why I ask: all else being equal, which experience would be better: flying jetBlue Mint from JFK to LAX, or from LAX to JFK?


_Updated to add:_ I did it! And you were absolutely right; JFK-LAX on Mint was worth it. The service was very very nice. I am going to be flying Mint on that route from here on out, if I can afford to.

I had a very unusual experience last month flying Alaska Airlines, and my girlfriend had the same experience with JetBlue today.

So we were flying from BOS -> SJC on Alaska, on an A320-200 on a very very cold Sunday evening. We were told that we had a totally full flight and that due to the weight, cold temperatures, and high winds, we needed to stop in Detroit to refuel the plane. We ended up getting canceled, sleeping in the terminal, and taking a Delta flight back. Alaska compensated us nicely but still...this is a new one for me - I've flown many transcontinental trips over the last ten years and haven't had the unplanned stop experience. 

Just today, my girlfriend is flying back from JFK -> SJC on JetBlue, on an A320-200, and had a similar experience, she was told due to high winds. Her flight has to stop in PHX to refuel. 

I was under the impression that for the A320ceo, a transcontinental hop was well within its operating range of 3200 miles. I've never had this experience or heard of others having to stop to get fuel. 

Am I crazy?  Is this normal? Is this just due to weather and unusual high altitude winds? I think I'm well versed on airline/airplane topics but I am not in the industry. Can someone offer insight?

I watch videos, read publications, listen to podcasts, etc. about the subject and have also started with flight simulators.  One thing I have noticed with the aviation nerd community is the extremely impassioned opinions regarding Airbus vs. Boeing, like it would make you think you were reading a debate on the Israel-Palestine conflict or something.

Most of the comments I read are also totally without merit.  I watch a YouTube video to learn about the 737 Max and half the comments are like unsubstantiated one-liners like ?The a320 neo is hands-down better? and ?if it ain?t Boeing, I ain?t going? and so forth.  Most people seem to comment based exclusively on which they think looks better, or which airline configures the seats in the cabin better, or rarely something like ?the 737 climbs better and has a higher service ceiling?, but ultimately, what do these things even matter?  It isn?t a military interceptor.  The planes are both widely popular, similarly reliable, do the same job, and the 737NG has basically the identical fatalities per departures as the a320.  From a passenger?s point of view, the negligible preferences don?t seem to warrant all the hatred.  I have been on wonderful, spacious 737?s operated by Southwest but also shitty crammed ones operated by other carriers.  JetBlue has a very spacious a320, but US Airways was not as nice.

I would be more interested in what the airlines actually think and how they figure one serves their operations better, or what pilots think, and I see pilots who are big fans of both.  I imagine that the planes are so operationally similar that even things like geopolitics play a bigger role sometimes than economics, like Poland?s LOT going with the 787 and bucking the European solidarity with Airbus and the animosity Poland and the EU have right now.

Then there are interesting situations where an airline will fly both, either because of a merger or other circumstances like Aeroflot not wanting to be too dependent on any foreign manufacturer.  The arrival of the MC-21 in a few years will be very interesting too.

Is there a good reason to feel particularly loyal of one aircraft manufacturer than the other?  I even own shares in Boeing and I don?t particularly care if I have to travel on an Airbus.  Aside from the seats being more cramped than the Republic E-jet I was connecting on, the Air France a380 was such a wonderful flight!"

The conference features presentations and keynotes speakers from NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, Delta Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Piedmont Airlines, the Aviation Technician Education Council, the Air Line Pilots Association and the U.S. Air Force, among others.

Attendees from the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands are participating as subject experts, including leaders in the aviation industry and from Embry-Riddle and other universities. Emerging topics focus on the accelerating demand for more pilots and mechanics, the introduction of new technology in aviation, the training and implications of personal air vehicles and unmanned aircraft systems and educating students at a younger age in aviation-related fields.

Embry-Riddle President P. Barry Butler, Ph.D., told the audience he was pleased to see symposium topics expanded to include aviation maintenance as well as autonomous vehicles and cyber security. His opening remarks also mentioned a number of programs at Embry-Riddle that are helping to address key issues such as pilot demand, including Embry-Riddle?s Daytona Beach and Prescott campuses partnership in the new Delta Propel Pilot Career Path Program, to identify, select and develop the next generation of pilots.

A 2017 Boeing study estimated that more than 600,000 commercial airline pilots will be needed globally over the next two decades.

In addition to Delta and other airlines, JetBlue Airways is working on creative approaches to pilot sourcing, including partnerships with universities such as Embry-Riddle, to help feed the pipeline, according to Nancy Shane, Ph.D., who has a master?s degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry-Riddle, and is manager of Pilot Gateway Programs at JetBlue.

Representatives from the Air Line Pilots Association also discussed education outreach programs providing guidance to pilots seeking employment and mentoring assistance.

New pilot training models such as mixed reality, augmented reality and virtual reality was featured topics on the first day of the conference.

Lulu Sun, Ph.D., Embry-Riddle associate professor of Engineering, presented ?Exploring the Best Practices of Virtual Training Delivery for the Prospective Air Traffic Controllers.? Stephanie Fussell, an Embry-Riddle doctorate student in Aviation discussed??Implementing Immersive Virtual Reality in an Aviation/Aerospace Teaching and Learning Paradigm,??and William L. Little, aerospace technologist for software systems with NASA, talked about NASA?s Kennedy Space Center?Augmented/Virtual Reality Lab.

Attendees also saw first-hand how augmented reality can be used, from seeing inside an actual aircraft engine to preflight training, as demonstrated by Lori Brown, associate professor and researcher from Western Michigan University, in her presentation, ?Holographic Micro-simulations to Enhance Aviation Training with Mixed Reality.?

?Right now the airline industry is facing as much stress in the hiring domain as it has in years,? said Michael E. Wiggins, Ph.D., professor and department chair of Aeronautical Science for Embry-Riddle?s Daytona Beach Campus. ?There is a big push to try to get flight students through the training faster, quicker, cheaper and more effective so that we can continue to safely operate the National Air Space System.?

I could see on approach that a JetBlue flight was approaching and landed almost simultaneously on a non-parallel runway. I'm not an expert, but I'd say we landed on runway 27 and they landed on 22L ([based on this](http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/about-logan/noise-abatement/how-logan-operates/)). We crossed 22L before getting off the runway. Is that normal? It was a strange site seeing a plane landing and coming straight at my window. What if it landed further down the runway or had to go around?"

Tonight, I was enjoying nice clear evening on my porch when I heard a different sound.  It was loud.  It was not a small plane.  When I counted 4 engines, I pinched myself. Turns out, it was CLX770, a Cargolux 744 on final straight from Luxembourg.  Eight and a half hours from across the globe, the first widebody I've seen in 24 months land in Indy.

With the recent acquisition of Virgin America by Alaska Airlines in the United States, I came to wonder about some of the potential questions management and branding employees come to face in times of mergers and growth.

As it stands, Alaska seems to be taking over Virgin's route network as well as fleet (among others). The Virgin name will disappear, and Alaska will find itself in a very dominant position on the West coast. This is all fine and good, but I can't help but feel it being a bit silly for an airline situated throughout the West coast to call itself ""Alaska Airlines"". 

Geographic-based names and branding aren't uncommon of course, but they tend to be present in situations where a niche is being served and growth/competition aren't really present (think of Hawaiian, Air Seychelles, Air France, etc.). These brands tend to be able to get away with these names because of their niche, high-end, flag carrier status. More often than not, these airlines get subsidized by their respective governments anyway to allow for their operation.

Southwest is a definite exception here, but it can be argued that they really managed to distance themselves from the geographic name entirely by giving little focus to the Southwest U.S. at all. Many airlines like the startup low-cost long-haul ""Level"" from IAG chose for a name with no geographic ties to aid future growth, even though it will be based in Barcelona.

While Alaska Airlines has a strong brand in its area (which is more Seattle than it is Alaska anyway), I was wondering if it would be in order for a brand change? Picking up from where Virgin left off is a big task, and the trendy West doesn't really seem all too ready for their arrival. I'd figure a snazzier brand would be more in line with their low-cost aspirations. Not necessarily Virgin, but something a little similar.
I'm from the East coast, so thankfully I've still got my lovely JetBlue anyway.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Alaska Airlines should probably give itself a name/brand change to allow for a more smooth expansion along the West Coast. Agree/disagree?"

I didn't take it too seriously before and have mostly flown JetBlue because I don't/didn't think I'd fly enough to get any worthwhile status on another airline, but am reconsidering and would love some thoughts from the group here. I really like their product and service all around and the frequency/timing of direct flights from JFK to the west coast, but realizing even if I hit Mosaic status, it's not really helpful as you don't get upgrades with it, and with no alliance/without many partners, I mainly get more JetBlue flights.

I also have heard from many people (and here) that since there are so many hardcore business flyers out of JFK, the odds of getting regular upgrades on my routes at a lower tier of status are pretty slim. Would consider opening another credit card to speed up/amplify benefits/miles earned. Currently use my CSR for everything.

My priority is to make my primary travel (to the West Coast) as comfortable as possible, but miles and upgrades for my vacations and other trips would be a nice bonus, just not sure I'll get any of them. I like JetBlue & Alaska (experiences, product, companies), am indifferent to AA/Delta, and despise United (plus don't want to be stuck with everything being out of EWR).

I like Delta's ~~transfer partners~~ alliance a bit more and my recent research makes me think I'd do okay with them. How's the product on the transcon flights on the 757? Would I actually \_get\_ any upgrades with Delta gold? (Maybe could even squeeze out Platinum if I shifted some of my other travel).

Thoughts?

Stats:

* I'm based in NYC, my preferred airport (by a long stretch) is JFK.
* Generally, I fly to the West Coast (SFO or LAX) for work at least 6 times a year, as well as various other ad hoc trips. Most domestic, but occassional international popping up as well. I'd generally be in Premium Economy but can sometimes get Business Class fares in my range.
* For personal travel, my future MIL is based in LA, so we usually go out there at least 2 more times a year. Plus other trips/vacations (3-4 times a year, sometimes domestic, sometimes international- South America and Europe recently and the near future).
* I'm on track to fly a little over 55k miles this year, likely the same or more next year as well."
"d7wijq"|"San Juan trip in January"|"My partner and I are going on a cruise in January that departs from San Juan on 1/4, returning 1/14.   We booked the cruise in cash via Costco Travel (very happy with the deal we got there), but we now need airfare and pre-cruise hotel.  I have some options but I'd love to know if there's something better.  I have \~100K each Chase UR points and AMEX points, and \~75K CapitalOne points.  Gold Status with United and Marriot, but not many points banked in either.

**Flights**

RT travel PHL -> SJU, 1/3/2020, returning 1/14/2020.  2 people, economy is fine.  

Outbound flights appear to be \~double the cost of return flights.

AA is hubbed in PHL and flies direct, \~$560 cash -> 76K Chase points via Chase travel.  I don't have enough AA points to book through them directly, and I don't know of any way to transfer in.

BA only offers reward flights for the return, non-direct (8h vs 3.5h) for 36K Avios total = \~25K MR points at current rates.  Then I could book the outbound leg via Chase points for \~48K, total price 73K.  That helps me use some MR points (which I've been having difficulty doing) but is a much crappier return flight.

I can't find any United Saver availability, and JetBlue and Delta would each take close to 100K points for the trip.  SW doesn't fly there on our dates.

Short answer, I think I need to book with Chase UR points.  I know the 1.5 cent value isn't the best I can get, but I don't think I can do any better on this trip.

&#x200B;

**Hotel**

Marriott has one Category 3 hotel in San Juan, a Courtyard, which is bookable for 17.5K points, or 14K Amex points with the current transfer bonus.  The hotel is currently booking for $250 per night, which seems par for other hotels in downtown San Juan.  This seems like a slam dunk - anybody see any downsides?"

 - Which domestic travel partner (JetBlue or Alaska Airlines) has a better mileage program (i.e. easier to redeem)?
 - Is it better to earn Emirates points, and then try and book either JetBlue or Alaska flights through their portal, or instead input my JetBlue or Alaska mileage program details when I book my Emirates flight and directly earn onto those programs?

I live in NYC, so it is more likely I will be flying JetBlue than Alaska, but I'm not sure how their awards compare. Thanks!"

"c2bqfl"|"Offered free Gold Status on AA for 3 months even though I typically fly United. Worth booking upcoming flights on AA instead of United?"|"I checked my e-mail today and found American Airlines offered me free gold status until 9/25. The promotion is to maintain gold through Jan 2021 by spending $850 EQD and going 7,000 EQMs by 9/25.

This came as a surprise as I am not a loyal AA flyer. I fly somewhat often for work, ranging from 3-6 days a month. I have 9.9K miles on AA, about 6K flown this year from trips to Vegas, Miami, and Boston.

&#x200B;

My upcoming trips (none of are booked yet):

\-RT DC to Madison for work (highly likely)

\-RT DC to Orlando for work

\-RT DC to San Francisco for work

\-1 way DC to Boston (other way is  on Jetblue, this was a personal trip so I went with who was cheaper)

&#x200B;

Looking at my trips above and roughly calculating cost, it looks like I could hit the $ easily and the 7,000 miles given the 7x bonus calculation. (I'll likely have one other work trip thrown in, but these are confirmed) which would get me to gold on AA through 2021. However, I typically fly United since I grew up near a hub and tried to stay somewhat loyal when convenient and/or affordable. I have 27K miles on United but not any status (and a RT flight to Spain booked on United). I was planning to book all of my above trips on United for this reason, to keep accruing miles.

&#x200B;

So my question is:

1. Should I switch plans and book all of my upcoming trips on AA instead of United to hit the promotion? Am I wildly off in my calculations that I would hit it with these confirmed trips?
2. Would it make sense to abandon loyalty to United and start flying AA going forward? I feel like if I switched to AA with the promotion I'm dividing up my miles and not really highly accruing on either (I'dbe about even on both airlines by Sept.)

&#x200B;

Some Notes:

\-I care more about being able to accrue miles (maybe to book a free trip in the near future) than say upgrades. The extra legroom perk would be nice since I'm tall but I wouldn't give up accruing more miles on one airline for that, especially since I can expense it for work flights on longer trips anyway.

\-I don't have a travel credit card except the Uber Barclays Card (3% cahs back regardless of brand).

\-I live close to DCA (an AA hub). United also flies out of DCA and has a hub in Dulles which isn't so far

\-I don't have strong feelings one way or the other about the brands. I've generally never had a problem on either.

\-For what it's worth, I'm silver on Marriott which has some kind of partnership with United

Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say ?Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what??

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program?s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program?s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline?s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won?t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don?t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE?s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR?s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let?s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don?t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are ?Savers? awards, and ?Anytime? awards.  

?Savers? are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline?s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

?Anytime? are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I?m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay?s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it?s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It?s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United?s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let?s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don?t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won?t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don?t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can?t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don?t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven?t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let?s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline?s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like ?Use Miles?.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let?s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn?t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline?s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people?s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for ?Mixed Class?, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can?t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let?s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it?s own, but I?ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people?s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don?t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline?s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip?

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can?t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You?ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don?t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you?ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state ?On Request?.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to ?Ticketed?.  In the past, I?ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline?s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline?s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don?t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn?t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don?t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

"bxi0mn"|"Europe summer 2021 with kids"|"My husband and I are in the very early stages of planning a three week trip to Europe for summer 2021. Since it's so far in the future, we have plenty of time to earn more points and miles before actually booking tickets, but right now I'm trying to figure out a general itinerary. 

Between the two of us, we have the following:

* 380k UR
* 270k MR
* 35k ThankYou
* 56k Southwest
* 31k Delta
* 10k United
* 36k Alaska
* 162k AA
* 18k BA
* 9k JetBlue

plus additional hotel points. My husband has an additional 50k UR pending. He is under 5/24, and I am not.

We want to spend about 3 weeks in Europe. We want to focus on Germany, but probably visit one to two other places while we are there--I'm thinking perhaps Amsterdam, somewhere in Belgium, and then cities in western Germany, but this is very flexible at this point. He has family in Stuttgart that we would consider visiting. We went to Switzerland in December 2018 and don't have any serious desire to return this soon. 

We will be traveling with at least two children--they will be 15 and 9 at that point, so visiting locations that they will enjoy will be key. We may also have an 18-month-old at that time, but whether he/she comes with us or not is also in question. (Baby is not born yet.) My husband and I want to fly in business and the 15 and 9 year old will fly economy. If the 18 month old is with us he/she will likely be a lap infant. Since the kids will fly economy, I'm open to booking their tickets with cash if we can get a great price on the same flights my husband and I would be on. We fly out of TPA but can easily get to MCO and can less easily get to MIA. We would prefer to go in early June, right after the kids get out of school.

Any thoughts? I know that right now it's super vague, my issue is that I don't really know where exactly we should go yet."

I only have Chase UR points, not AMEX or Citi.

Would love to get some advice on how to maintain multiple programs and which programs I should credit my future miles to.

* Delta: Similarly, should I stick with Delta or credit to others? I have only 3k with Delta.
* I have upcoming flights with Virgin Atlantic, Jetblue, and Emirates. This makes me even more confused as they have many partners as well. For example, for Virgin Atlantic, I'm torn between its own program, Delta, or ANA. For Emirates, I'm torn between its own program, Alaska, and JAL.

"5za6an"|"[Advice] Use UR or MR for Jetblue LAX -> NYC?"|"$139 = 9,266 UR points (through UR portal, no transfer partner availability) = 1.5 cpp 

9,200 TrueBlue Points = 11,500 MR points = 1.2 cpp

I go to NYC once a month and have been mainly using UR points until I got the Amex Plat bonus. Despite the MR having lower cpp, the UR seems more ""valuable"" to me since there is more flexibility and higher redemption through their travel portals. 

MR only transfers to Delta and Jetblue (250:200). UR transfers to Delta, Southwest and United. UR portal redeems at 1.5 cpp and MR portal redeems at 1.0 cpp.

Here's the deal: I earn a decent amount of Amex Gold reward points (about 500/month). I live near an American hub, but AMEX doesn't transfer directly to AA, so I've been transferring them to BA, because I've read that you can then transfer them to Iberia and then AA (or something like that? -- like  I said, it's confusing to me). We also have a lot of JetBlue flights here and we fly them a couple of times a year, so it would be really easy for me to transfer my Amex points straight to JetBlue instead, but I've read that the transfer rate isn't so great. Also, I'm Platinum on AA and would like to keep my mileage with them pretty high. So I guess I'm asking what you would do if you were in my shoes? 

Also, we do have 2 daily BA flights to London from here, so I could potentially use the Avios straight up if I accumulate enough of them, but then I would also have to pay BA's exorbitant fuel surcharges (sigh).

I plan on getting 6 one way tickets from Buffalo, NY to LAX on April 15 (currently available)....and if paid in cash = $942. If paid using the current MR to JB ratio, the one way will cost us 10,600 pts/person or 63,600 JB points + $33.60. I'll be using 80K MR in order for me to get 64K JB points.This flight would be a DIRECT FLIGHT.

The other option I thought about transferring UR to Southwest as well. The # of points needed/person is 10,340/person or 62,040 UR points + $33.60. This is NOT A DIRECT FLIGHT. 

I also checked another option since we will also be visiting Toronto. If we do a one way from YYZ to LAX  (direct flight) = 75,000 Aeroplan miles + $734 CAD. 

I also tried American Airlines from YYZ to LAX (direct flight) = 150,000 AA points + $285.

I'm leaning towards the JB option (because it's a direct flight), and I also tend to value UR points more. I might have answered my own question, and I think writing it down helped me rationalize things. 
Just wondering if anyone else has any suggestions? I appreciate your feedback. Thanks!

"ayl7et"|"Advice for booking business/first Boston to Tokyo in late 2019"|"Hi all- we are getting married in mid-October, and we are tossing around the idea of Japan for our honeymoon. I started doing a bunch of research about ways to book business or first with miles/points but am getting pretty overwhelmed, hoping someone may be able to steer me in the right direction. 

We have points spread across a number of different programs, listed below, broken down by mine (P1) vs hers.

Basically we are looking for: 

* Boston to Tokyo R/T
* Business or First
* approx. 11-15 days total
* Earliest possible date we could leave is ~10/16/2019; we?d consider anytime Nov/Dec, possibly Jan, depending on availability, pricing etc, but preference is late Oct / early-mid Nov
* We would plan to travel around Japan, rather than spending the full 2 weeks in Tokyo. But I assume Tokyo round trip is much more economical than open jaw?

Program | P1 | P2
-: | :- | :-
Chase UR | 328k | 218k
Amex MR | - | 60k
AAdvantage | 172k | 69k
BA Exec Club | 155k | -
Delta | 42k | 4k 
United | 123k | -
Southwest | 43k | -
JetBlue | 15k | 38k
Hyatt | 51k | 23k
Hilton | 5k | 20k
Marriott | 62k | 70k

Can anyone provide some guidance as to what I should be looking for, the best way(s) to search for availability, or any other general tips? Since there aren?t as many direct Boston to Tokyo flights, am I better off searching for award bookings from other cities, e.g. Chicago or LA to Tokyo, to get a better idea of actual cost of the main leg? Also I noticed that a lot of possible Bus/First flights I found were deceptive since the short leg, e.g. BOS-ORD was first but ORD-NRT was Economy. Are there other ways to weed those out? But I wouldn?t mind flying Economy on legs within the US (and am not opposed to 1-stop itineraries)

Or, would you recommend using some sort of award booking service to assist us with all this? 

Also we are both 3/24 for Chase and are willing to apply for new cards, Biz or personal. I might end up going for the SW Companion Pass (already got the personal Rewards Plus), though I know that wouldn?t help with a Japan trip. 

Thanks in advance."
"abq1lc"|"Going to be doing a lot of NYC to Washington DC travel and looking to maximize points/gain status"|"I'm going to be going back and forth from NYC to DC relatively frequently (maybe 4-6 flights a month? Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"

My paralysis comes from the crazy number of options and combinations for flights (High likelihood I'm overcomplicating it). It seems like I can be leveraging excursionist/stopovers/open jaws, but for some reason they aren't slapping me in the face. Very open to positioning flights to LAX or JFK.

Couple Requirements: SQ Suites at some point, Business Class International, Either beginning or ending in Maldives (too hard to do in the middle of a trip)

Points: 320K+FNCs Hilton (Diamond), 100K Hyatt (Explorist), 500K+ Marriott (Plat), 300K Avios, 300K UR, 150K MR, 200K United (Silver), 120K Jetblue (for domestic)

My Thoughts were something along the lines of 

F1 Positioning: SFO-LAX (if needed)

F2: SFO/LAX-HND-SYD (Stopover in Japan)

F3: SYD-SIN-Bali (Stopover in SIN?)

F4: Bali-SIN-MLE

F4a: Seaplane Transfers (Covered by Amex GCs via Delta)

F5: MLE-SIN

F6 SQ Suites: SIN-FRA-JFK (NYC)

F7 Positioning: (NYC)-SFO


My Questions - 

1. Can I put two open jaws together to form a ""RT"" to get a stopover (I.E. F2 & F7, F1 & F3). Does anyone have advice on the first half of this trip (Is it even realistic to get 2 stopovers?)

2. Can I book SQ Suites from Maldives and combine F6+F7 (MLE-SIN-FRA-JFK). When I searched on Krisflyer, anytime I added MLE in the leg, it forced me into Biz Class search.

3. Can I use Avios anywhere here (minus the fuel surcharges etc.)

4. We are open to pushing the trip back a month or two in case I need to get a couple AA cards, but I'm hoping to find some combination with my current stash

Id read that their policy was to charge exorbitant fees to bring them back to life so never bothered. This week I decided to call and ask, and was told all I had to do was purchase points worth ten percent of what had expired and then request they be put back on my account. So I bought 5k points for about $158 and now have... 53k hawaiin miles. 

At the very least I can use them for $400 plus in JetBlue flights so I don't feel bas about laying out the cash. But that's a bad redemption. Problem is I have no plans to fly to Hawaii any time soon, or Asia. The only other redemption I can see is a round trip flight on virgin to london for 60k in economy. That's a route I take fairly often, but will that redemption via Hawaiian miles come with the regular taxes and fees that virgin tacks on? If not then that might be appealing once I have a few amex points to top off my Hawaiian account.

Otherwise, anything I'm missing? If I was going to Hawaii or Asia I might work to build this into more, but I'd rather spend them now on something useful."

My goals are not super ambitious at this point. I'd like to be smart about capitalizing on some upcoming international travel if possible, and maybe get a free international trip or two when all is said and done. I don't really care about status or lounges or anything.

Assumptions I'm making (please correct me if any of this isn't true):

* I should pick one airline in each of the major alliances to accrue miles on
* I can accrue miles on one airline while flying another as long they're part of the same alliance
* I can redeem miles on any airline in an alliance regardless of the airline loyalty program they were accrued in (I know exchange rates, availability, etc. vary)

Couple of other things to note:

* I have to use a company credit card to pay for company travel
* My company prefers Delta and UA domestically (AA is out of policy)
* I have two international trips coming up, one in September to Japan (business class), the other to Scotland in October (likely flying economy w/ BA).

So

* For my upcoming international trips, should I bank miles in BA or AA or someone else?
* For my ongoing domestic business travel, should I accrue on UA and Delta or pick international carriers to apply miles to?
* What other questions should I be asking?

"9p9do6"|"BOS to HNL Redemption options"|" 

Trying to navigate the cheapest award options to book 4 one-way First Class tickets on the new direct route on Hawaiian Airlines from BOS to HNL on 8/12/2019. I have Chase rewards points that I can convert as needed to programs, but looking for the most cost effective option. I understood that JetBlue would be 70k points per ticket but when I called them earlier today they didn't show availability for that segment out that far yet. Does anyone know the most cost effective option that has booking availability for that date? Any pointers to navigate this would be greatly appreciated.

Chase Rewards: \~220k

Citi TY: \~60k

"9eqqhv"|"[Trip Report] Continuation of my 14 trips 14 months"|"[Continued from my 14 trips in 14 months post earlier this year.](https://old.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/7tn6se/trip_report_14_trips_in_14_months/) - It ended up being 15 trips 15 months counting Feb 2018.



| Location/Date | Cash/Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
Costa Rica Feb 2018 | Hyatt free night along with some points and 50k Skypesos | My annual free hyatt night was coming to expiration. I really wanted to put it to full use at the Andaz in Costa Rica. Moved some UR over to make it a long weekend trip. Blew a bit more skypesos than I?d like but I really wanted to get away for Prez weekend. The Andaz was a beautiful property. The base forest room was really nice with a shower that opens up to the patio. Delicious mangos and really fun cocktail and ceviche class. Highly recommend people to burn their free night here. Love to come back.
March 2018-April 2018 Break | Break | Trip break, needed to focus on work and even with freeish flights/hotels, the cost does add up.
Hong Kong May 2018 | **75k Aeroplan Eva Air, 115k AA Cathay Pacific F** | After two months of no flying, I really wanted to get the hell away for Memorial Day weekend. CX F availability finally opened up from HKG-JFK. I really wanted to try out EVA Air J so this was perfect for 75k Aeroplan. Booked everything on a Monday, flew out on Thursday. Drank so much on Eva, that I didn?t even made my seat lie flat. I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in HK. The location couldn?t be more perfect. Easy to get around. My last night I blew my IHG free night at the Intercontinental HK due to a friend?s recommendation. Gorgeous fuckin lobby but the location was a bit further away and I felt like the rooms were a bit outdated. The bathroom was huge though. The main reason I went to HK, was to fly on CX F. I lounged hop all of CX?s lounges. The Pier and The Wing was best. Love the Cabanas tub/shower. The food was great. And wow the CX F seat was wide as fuck. Sleeping in it was so comfy too. Much more comfier than SQ Suites. I do think the tv monitor could use an update.
Cancun June 2018 | 2 free hyatt night, 25k hyatt | My bro had his hyatt night?s expiration coming and so I moved my points over to make it 3 nights. Took him to Hyatt Ziva Cancun. I honestly really like this property better than Zilara. All the kids there don?t really bother. So much more food options. I think I gained an extra 10 lbs with all the food I ate. Would come back here instead of Zilara. Blew some Delta gc and Jetblue points to get/leave CUN.
Chicago June 2018 | 6k Jetblue, free Hyatt Stay | This was an extremely spur of the moment trip for me. One of chefs I follow, Wagyumafia was having a pop up in Chicago. I flew out on a Saturday morning to Chicago, dined with him at 1am, flew out the next morning. Stayed at the Hyatt The Loop. Got a corner room, huge ass room. Def recommend this hotel. Forgot how much points I paid for this.
Jordan and Egypt July 2018 | 25k Merrill, BA Avois, Cash flight | Went on this trip with some churning friends. Found a great cash deal from CAI-JFK on Air Italty?s converted old Qatar planes for $500. Booked using my Merrill(I love you). I knew if I wanted to do Egypt, I needed to do Petra, Jordan as well. Got a cash flight to Jordan. We spent a couple days in Jordan and did Petra, Wadi Rum and Crown Plaza Dead Sea. Highly recommended it. Spent a night in Sun City Camp in their Martian Bubble Tent. The stars were beautiful. Dead Sea was nice and holy shit did it burned all our eyes. We used Avois to get to AMM-CAI, forgot how much. Egypt isn?t my favorite place but seeing the Pyramids in person was nice. Air Italy?s J seat wasn?t bad at all but not really to write about.
San Diego July 2018 | Delta Companion Cert | My yearly trek to SDCC. Used my delta companion cert with a friend. Tamed SDCC year due to no Marvel Studios or GoT. 
Buenos Aires August 2018 | **48k Skypesos**, 20k Park Hyatt | I didn?t get a chance to make it to South America last year in my travels so I had to make up for it. Months ago, Delta had a flash sale for South America. I could not resist. Nice getaway from the humid NYC Weather but man I did not expect it to be that cold in BA. Stayed at the Milhouse Hostel, a great party hostel, shitty beds. All my dorm mates were making fun of me cause I went out to eat steak almost every night. My last night, I booked Park Hyatt Buenos Aires because I could not turn down a chance to stay at a Palace. The PH BA has two buildings, the palace and the tower. Roomed at the tower with a corner view of the Palace. They offered me a room with twin beds and asked they can make it a king bed, wtf? What they really did was just push the two beds together which ended up even better because it was wide as fuck. Ended missing my flight out due to traffic but luckily I had enough avois in my account to book on AA the next night out. Burned 30k IHG for a night stay at the Intercontinental. Room felt outdated but whatever, I needed a room for the night and it was free. Went back to the hostel party and club afterwards and flew out the next night.



- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends. Except for Buenos Aires, spend 10 days there a bit long for me.
- 6 trips in the last 4 months was fun. 
- How much points do I have left? Idk, I know its over a million across the board but under 2 million. Still got 400k UR, 340k AA, 300k MR off the top of my head.



The next trip I have booked is St. Regis Maldives again in Feb 2018. Managed to catch the 340k marriott during the merge. Was hoping to go this year since I?m Plat due to the Ritz for free breakfast but Feb will give me a longer time to save money. How to get there? Idk yet. 

Really hoping to fit a long weekend in Tokyo before the year?s end."

Trying to do my first award booking here! Hoping to fly one-way from NYC to Brisbane on UR points. I've found a couple options, mentioned below, one of which is decently good, but I still feel like maybe I'm missing something. Can anybody chime in if I've overlooked something obvious?

Thanks in advance!

    But could try to upgrade with more points?

*Option 4:* Try to transfer UR to Marriot and then SPG, to get more options? "

"8lm9ia"|"First time redemption booked! Looking to learn for future redemptions."|"Post-booking critiques welcome:

Right about at my 1 year churniversary I've finally made my first long-haul premium bookings with SO on points.

Leg 1: JFK -> IST 
LH/ J (~1 hr layover FRA to GVA, then GVA to IST (on TK)). 
The FRA-> IST direct TK leg wasn't available so I had to call UA to manually book as FRA->GVA->IST. 
Booked via united for 70k each + ~63$ tax. 

Hotel: Doubletree Istanbul - Sirkeci for 4 nights, paying cash (its ~$100/night). It's a short trip in IST so I picked this over the other istanbul hotels primarily because of location.

Leg 2: IST to ASR (cappadocia) 
TK Y (1 hr flight) booked via united for 8k each + ~6$ tax.

Hotel: Osmanbey Cave Hotel. It was about $90/night x2 nights so I paid cash. There weren't really any deals via CSR 1.5x on hotels that were in the area we wanted to be in.
Booked Hot air balloon ride via CSR 1.5x though for 24k UR.

Leg 3: ASR to MLE (via IST) 
TK J 
Booked via united 55k each + ~33$ tax. 

Hotel: Conrad Rangali, booked 95k/night x3 nights + 1 weekend cert. 
I have diamond status which ohopefully well help with upgrades. I have 2 nights beach villa 2 nights overwater villa, but I haven't quite decided exactly what I should finalize them as.
I would have done 5 nights on points to get 5th night free, but due to PTO I didn't want to sacrifice more time.

Just signed up for spark biz 1k that I plan on using for the sea plane $$$. 

Leg 4: MLE to IAD via DOH. 
QR in J. 
The DOH-IAD leg is in Qsuites which I think will be nice with SO.
I think QR provides a free hotel since the DOH layover is >8 hours. I need to confirm this. 
Booked via 70k AA miles each, + ~$70 tax which I will use part of my biz plat AA incidental reimbursement to cover, then use CSR to cover the rest for trip delay etc.

Since home airport is JFK, I'll be booking an IAD to JFK on jetblue for about 5k points each. 

Total costs:

MILES
266k UA (mostly transferred from UR)
140k AA
11k Jetblue

POINTS
285k Hilton + weekend cert from Ascend spend

$600 on the cash hotels.
$1100~ for seaplane
$1200-1500 Anticipated on the food in rangali (we don't drink so no need to worry about those costs) 

Only relevant cards included... I have spend and built miles via freedom and other MS too so the bonuses may not exactly have been the direct result of the booking:
CSR 100k
CIP #1 100k
CIP #2 100k
UA 40k

Amex HH Ascend
100k bonus + 200k MS'd

AA Plat biz 70k
AA Plat pers 70k
Jetblue Personal 40k
Spark $1000 bonus

This trip is for next month and I did all the booking over the past week, so availability was tough, otherwise aeroplan via TK probably would have been a good option to save a bunch of UR/UA miles. I could have done aeroplan anyway and paid taxes but it was basically the equivalent in taxes as it was for miles and I can build UR very easily via MS etc so I made the decision to burn them.

I would love to hear the experts' thoughts on the bookings so that I can learn!"

"8bekbc"|"JFK/LAX to BKK - Short Notice"|"Hey, I've been looking for several months for a round\-trip flight to Bangkok for two people. It can be from anywhere JetBlue flies, as I?ll be flybg from Florida to there using separate points \(so JFK, LAX, etc\), and in any class. We were still building up my girlfriend's points, so weren't able to book until now. I know it's very short notice. I'm a little panicky myself!

We each have 140k UR points.

The trip will be for 21 days, leaving sometime on/after May 11th, but it can happen in June too.

I was hoping for F/J on ANA using UR to Virgin Atlantic deal, but there's no availability that I could find. Nothing shows up for LAX \(not sure if I'm doing it wrong\), and everything for JFK is waitlisted.

It's 150k pts \+ fees for mixed j/econ class flights elsewhere on United's site. 80k \+ $50 for economy.

I've found cash economy tickets for $700 though, so it doesn't make sense to use 80k pts. I'd love to have business class, at least one way, but cannot find anything. I'm not sure if I'm just missing something huge or what, but I'd love some help.

I checked awardhacker without much luck too. I'm thinking cash is my best bet, but I'm sure I'm wrong.

tl;dr: I finally started burning through my points last Jan 2016. On my second trip in Feb 2016, I was drunk at the hostel bar and challenged myself to do 12 trips in 12 months. It just so happened to be 14 trips because I took a trip in Dec 2015 and Jan 2016.

Detailed Trips or as best as I can remember it.

| Location/Date | Cash/Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
Tokyo Dec 2016 | **60k Skypesos** on Delta Y, JFK-MSP-HND | Delta had a flash sale promoting their MSP - HND route. JFK happened to be on that promotion, JFK - MSP - HND. I wanted to go back to Tokyo for sometime now and figured a long weekend in Tokyo would be fun. I stayed at a capsule hostel, partied and ate my weekend away. Hoping to do this again sometime this year.
Singapore, Maldives, Tokyo Jan 2017 | **93.k SQ miles** on SQ Suites JFK-FRA-SIN, One way cash flight to MLE on tigerair, **75k Hyatt** for Park Hyatt Maldives, **15k Avois** MLE-CMB-SIN, **40k UA miles** on ANA F SIN-NRT, **80k AA miles** on JAL F | So this was my biggest goal and redemption. So this was my biggest goal and redemption. For years I?ve read about SQ Suites and my #1 goal in churning was this and I got it. Stayed in a hostel again in Singapore and man was it humid. I figured since I was in Signapore and the Maldives was so close, why not try and go for it. Park Hyatt didn?t have free nights available for my certificates but it was available for 25k per night. Booked 3 nights and paid for a cheap tigerair fight out. In hindsight, the tigerair was late at night, didnt get to PH until 1am. That was a waste. I?ve never been to a resort before and this was beautiful. Oh yea, used my Arrival miles to pay for the transfer fee. For this trip, I wanted to fly out of Tokyo either on JAL or ANA. I flew back to SIN using avois on SriLankan Y. I found a cheap 40k UA miles one way on ANA F. Hell yea I?m taking it and to my surprised it on the BB-8 plane. Spent another weekend in Tokyo, ate and drank away. JAL opened up and I took it home from NRT-JFK for 80k AA miles. I flew around the planet in 11 days.
Rome Feb 2017 | **60k Skypesos** on Altalia Y | I was itching to go away again and went to Rome for a long Prez weekend. Stayed at the Yellow Hostel, which I recommend to everyone. Toured, ate and drank away. I?m not religious by any means but man the Vactican was impressive. I?d love to visit again. During this weekend, I was drunk at the hostel bar and figured to myself why not try and do 12 trips in 12 months for 2017. 
Cancun Mar 2017 | **6k Jetblue** one way JFK-CUN, Cash flight Delta with gc CUN-JFK, **2 night free Hyatt Cert** at Hyatt Zilara | Used my 2 Hyatt free night at Hyatt Zilara Cancun. Beautiful property, great good. My friend and I ate our way through this weekend. Sushi was trash.
Puerto Rico April 2017 | **25k Merrill points** | This weekend happened to have a big storm in NYC. My flight delayed for 2 days. Tested out the trip delay insurance and hey they approved it even tho JFK was my home airport. Spent 2 days in Puerto Rico. Wish I had more time to explore.
Iceland May 2017 | Cash flight | Went to Iceland for a long Memorial day weekend. Stayed a hostel again. Man Iceland is f?king expensive. I could not be the foodie like I wanted to because it was so expensive. Went on a tour that took us to a natural hot spring, that was cool. Didn?t do blue lagoon. Made a hostel friend and tagged along his ride for the day. Love to go back when I have some extra extra money. The daylight at 2am was insane. Definitely messed with my head
Havana June 2017 | **SW CP to Havana** | Made a churning friend and we went to Havana. Humid af, didn?t understand all the hype about it. Would not go back.
Tijuana July 2017 | Walked over to Tijuana | Ok, this one I cheated a bit. I was in town in San Diego for Comic Con and to make sure I was out of the country, I walked over the border to Tijuana, ate some tacos and walked back over.
Thailand August 2017 | **120k UA miles** on Asiana F going, **80k ANA J** back. | So this was booked over Thanksgiving 2016. My friend?s biggest goal was going to Thailand and we were researching ways to get there. He wanted to fly any J class and we found 80k Asiana J one way. Impulsively we booked it roundtrip. Over the course of 2017, I moved over another 40k from UR to UA and upgraded myself to Asiana F. The look on my friend?s face when he realized I was flying F day of, was priceless. Of course I invited him down to my suite and we drank some whisky. We paid cash for our hotel stays in Thailand. Have to say, the Hilton gold came in handy for breakfast. Went to Bangkok, Chang Mai, Phi Phi Islands and Phuket. Love to go back and explore more of the islands. I hope that russian milf is doing well.
Bahamas September 2017 | **25k Skypesos** on Delta Y, **40k Hyatt** at Grand Hyatt Baha Mar | Delta had a flash sale to the Carribean for 25k and I moved over 40k UR and stayed at the new Grand Hyatt Baha Mar. Also used a club room cert to get access to the club lounge. I love free food. Another beautiful property and nice pools. Though wasn?t worth 40k points for the weekend.
Oslo & Bergen October 2017 | Cash flight on Norweign JFK-OSL and SAS BGO-OSL, **25k Merrill** points on TAP Portugal J OSL-LIS-JFK | Went on a trip with new churning friends. One of them found the cheap J fare from OSL-LIS-JFK on TAP Portugal, now we just have to made our way to OSL. We blew $300 each at Maaemo, a 3 michelin star restaurant. That was delicious. Drove our way up to Bergen from OSL, great views along the way. Took a flight back to OSL from BGO and flew back on TAP Portugal J. TAP was ok, nothing really to be excited about.
Singapore & Maldives November 2017 | **120k SQ miles** on SQ Suites, JFK-FRA-SIN. Cash at Marina Bay Sands. **15k Avois** SIN-CMB-MLE. **205.5k SPG** points at St. Regis Maldives. $100 flight MLE-DXB-JFK on Emirates | Sometime during 2017, Emirates had a mistake fare for MLE-JFK. Friend and I took advantage of that. He was jealous I went to the Maldives and the one way I?m going back is if I can get the St. Regis. Good thing for still living at home, I took advantage of my family(with their consent) a built up a stash of SPG points. Booked 3 nights overwater villa at 58.5k a night over Thanksgiving. No more availability for extra nights but cash and points were available for a garden villa for $300/15k points a night. Spent 5 days in the Maldives but shitty weather. Backtracking a bit, since I was transitting through Singapore, I wanted to try a fly SQ suites again. I didn?t get off the waitlist until 5 days before. I was adamant to take advantage of everything on the flight but I ended up sleeping through most of it. Met up with my friend in Singapore and we spent a night at Marina Bay Sands. Pool was beautiful but shitty weather.
Brussels & Paris December 2017/NYE | **60k Skypesos** JFK-BRU RT | This was my last trip for the year and I wanted to do NYE in another city. Figured lets go to Europe. Found a 60k flight RT, JFK-BRU. I didn?t want to spend all my time in BRU and so I went down to Paris for NYE. Stayed at a hostel, made some friends and partied into NYE. Went back to Brussels for a night and flew out.
Jamaica Jan 2018 | **15k Jetblue miles**, JFK-MBJ. Cash flight back. **2 Free night at Hyatt** Zilara Rosehall | This time my friend comes through. He got 2 free hyatt nights as well and wanted to go to another Zilara so we can pig out. I moved over enough points to cover one night so we?d get 3 nights. Got upgraded to a large Butler Suite. Property overall was not impressive. The jerk chicken and french restaurant was nice but thats about it. The pools were cold af. Would not come back here.


Overall, 2017 was my best year living life. Even though I traveled for mostly freeish, my bank account hurts. 

**Notes**

- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends, usually Thur-Tues. I also transferred over a decent amount of vacation days in Jan 2017 which helped out alot.

- Still living at home, which helps my bank account and I run through all our bills through my cards.

- Player 2 and half of 3 with family members, which helped me alot

- Still have 500k UR, 170K AA, 130k Skypesos, 100k SPG, 170k MR and others

- Looking to build up my points stash on my extra players in 2018.

- Itching to book another flight/trip. Really want to fly EY apartments."

I'd hate to see it go to waste, so I figured I would see if anyone is traveling with a layover in Boston (South Station), NY Penn, Philly 30th st station, DC, Chicago, LA, or Portland.  All those stations have lounges where this pass works. If you want it, it's yours free and clear. Expires Halloween."

"7jdt18"|"Need some help with BOS -> UAE trip"|"Hello Everyone,

Between my wife and I we have 5 free nights at a Ritz Carlton T1-4 property and we're thinking about cashing in in the UAE.  It looks like these are our options:

Abu Dhabi: The Ritz-Carlton Abu Dhabi, Grand Canal

Dubai: The Ritz-Carlton, Dubai International Financial Centre

Ras Al Khaimah: The Ritz-Carlton Ras Al Khaimah, Al Wadi Desert

Ras Al Khaimah: The Ritz-Carlton Ras Al Khaimah, Al Hamra Beach

I don't think I have a preference on one or the other - has anyone stayed at any of these locations and either loved it or wish they hadn't?

Next question: what are my airline options?  We would be flying from Boston (BOS).  I did a bit of research and - I'm not sure if this is right or not - it looks like we can book with Emirates with Alaska using American Airlines points?  Is that correct?  Between my wife and I we have about 700k American Airlines points.  We'd like to use those to get us first-class if we can.  I also have about 200k URs if those are necessary to use, but I'd rather not.

Thanks for your help.


EDIT: I understand now.  Best route is to fly from BOS -> JFK, and then JFK - AUH via Etihad and book with AA."

I saw via Singapore's site that you are able to designate a few nominees whom you can book flights for using points, does anyone here have experience with this?

"7ihst6"|"Hawaii Trip"|"I know there are a lot of posts about Hawaii...so here?s another one!

My fianc? and I are getting married in April 2018. We're planning a delayed honeymoon - probably August - October timeframe. Our leading candidate for destination is Hawaii. I've spent the past few days researching all the different ways to get there with points. I have the following points: 260k UR, 130k MR, 40k United, 120k SW, 70k JetBlue, 140k Hilton, 130k Marriott, 80k SPG.

I realize that the cheapest way to get there with points is probably transferring to Korean Air. However, I think I want to book the tickets before we're actually married and I know they have restrictions on that. I know there are a few other cheap options (Air France, British Airways, etc.) but I would really like to fly at least one way in first class. It seems like the best first class going to Hawaii is on Hawaiian Airlines. If we're not flying first class, I would at least like a plane with 2-X-2 seating. I believe that leaves either a 767 or A330. All of Hawaiian's flights appear to be on an A330 with 2-4-2 seating. The only reasonable option I see for a 767 is Delta metal booked through Air France but the availability is a pretty iffy. Also, I'm thinking of using the UR points on hotels. It doesn't seem like MR points transfer as well to hotels.

This is the itinerary I came up with and points/cost for each leg.

* TPA > JFK on JetBlue (Coach for 7.3k or $119 per Person)

* JFK > HNL on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First 80k MR Points per Person)

* HNL > OGG on Hawaiian ($73 per Person - I will try to see if I can get the Amex Plat Reimbursement on these.)

* OGG > SFO on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First $567.33 per Person)

* SFO > FLL on JetBlue (Mint for 33.7k or $449 per Person)

* FLL > TPA on Southwest (8k or $134 per Person)


Total:

* 73.8k JetBlue (for 2 People w/10% Credit from JetBlue Plus Card) ~1.84 cents/point

* 160k MR Points (for 2 People) ~2.09 cents/point

* 16k SW Points ~1.67 cents/point

* $1,280.66 (for 2 People)


Am I being crazy with all of this? Should I just book round trip with Air France or British Airways and likely get stuck in a middle site for 5+ hours?"
"5t5l93"|"Award Ticket Basics Part I - Non-Airline Miles Redemptions"|"##Award Ticket Basics  Part I - Non-Airline Miles Redemptions

Feb 8th, 2017

As more and more people get into churning, more and more folks find their way to r/awardtravel, and basic award redemption questions are popping up daily.  While we have some great guides on the sidebar, It looks like we are missing some pointers on award tickets.  This article will discuss some of the basic concepts in award travel.

###What is an Award Ticket?

The concept is pretty simple here:  Award Ticket is a airline ticket that you get by redeeming Airline Miles, Airline Points, Bank Miles, or Bank points.  The ticket usually is paid for entirely via your points/miles, but you may have to pay for taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges separately.  Notice that I listed multiple currencies that can be used for award tickets, and this is where much confusion and complexity comes into the picture.

###List of Different Award Tickets Types

I?m going to start by listing different But common award ticket types.  I?m trying to be complete, but I?m sure I?m going to miss some.  Feel free to leave me a note to add to this.

- Using Chase Ultimate Rewards Point in Chase Portal
- Using Citi Thankyou Points in Citi Portal
- Using AmEx Membership Rewards Points in AmEx Portal
- Using Barclays Rewards Points 
- Using Capital One Venture Reward Miles
- Using Southwest Airline Rapid Rewards Points
- Using JetBlue TrueBlue points
- Using Airline Miles to redeem Saver Awards
- Using Airline Miles to redeem Anytime Awards
- Using Airline Miles to redeem for Saver Awards on Partner Airlines

In Part I, I?m going to cover all the non-airline Miles redemptions.  In part II, I will be covering Airline Miles redemptions, award charts, alliance partners, etc.

### Using UR/MR/TY Points in a Portal

This is probably the most simple award ticket type.  When you are booking a ticket through a bank portal, you are effectively redeeming your points at a fixed value, and buying the desired ticket.  For example, if you have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card, then redeeming for a ticket at the UR portal will give you an exchange rate of 1.5 cents per point.  This means that if you find a flight listed for $300, you will need to spend 20,000 UR points for that ticket.

#### Pros:

- You are not dependent on airlines making award seats available on the desired flight.  Since you are effectively buying a ticket, as long as there is a seat left on the flight, you can redeem for that seat.
- Since you are effectively purchasing the seat, if the fare class earns miles, you will earn miles after you complete the flight.
- You are basically booking through a travel agent, so you don?t have to study award charts or other complications.
- The redemption cost typically is all inclusive.  Fees and taxes will just be paid for via points as well.

#### Cons:

- Some fare class earn little or no miles.  If you redeemed for the lowest cost ticket, you probably shouldn?t count on earning lots of miles for the flight.
- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your redemption cost just went up as well.
- Bank Portals don?t always have the lowest price tickets. A common complaint is that people can find a cheap flight elsewhere, but unable to match that price in the Portal.
- The high prices for premium class tickets means those redemptions are often out of reach.  A $7,500 First Class ticket would cost 500,000 UR points, and very few people can accumulate that many points via churning. 

#### When should you redeem through a Portal

- When the airfare is low.  If there is a $600 RT ticket to Asia, that will only cost you 40,000 UR points, and that is lower than every other redemption choices.
- When you MUST fly on a certain flight.  If the flight you need do not have other award seats, you are left with buying the ticket.  It becomes a choice on whether you will pay cash to save your points, or pay with your points to save the cash.
- When you can?t find a better deal by transferring your points to a particular airline.  If your goal is to travel in premium class, your best bet is to save these points to transfer to an airline program.

### Using Barclay/Capital One Miles/Points

You?ve seen the commercials, how Capital One miles can be used on any airline anytime.  Well, that is because while Barclay and Capital One call them ?Miles?, they are basically Points that are worth 1 cent each when redeeming for travel.

For both of these banks, the points are very easy to use, and they have the added bonus they can be used to redeem for any expense coded as Travel.   For example, I have redeemed Barclay Award Miles for the cost of a bus tour, as well as tickets for a train ride.  To begin the redemption process, just purchase your travel/airline ticket either through a website or a travel agent, and pay using your Barclay/Capital One card.  In a few days, the charge will show up online in your credit card account, and you can redeem your Award points against the travel charges as statement credit.  So if you bought a $200 airline ticket on your Capital One Venture card, you can select that $200 charge, and ?erase? that charge by redeeming 20,000 Venture Miles.

#### Pros:

- You are not dependent on airlines making award seats available on the desired flight.  You can find the cheapest ticket that works for you, and just buy it.
- You are purchasing the ticket, and if the fare class earns miles, you will earn miles after you complete the flight.
- You don?t have to study award charts or other complications.
- You can usually pay for Fees and taxes as well if they are part of the same charge.
- You can redeem for other travel charges, such as train tickets, rental cars, etc
- You can pay for a ticket to help with meeting minimum spend on a card, then use the point you earn to get statement credit for the same ticket.  This is one of few cases you can use your bonus before you actually earn them.

#### Cons:

- Some fare class earn little or no miles.  If you bought the lowest cost ticket, you probably shouldn?t count on earning lots of miles for the flight.
- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your points don?t go as far.
- There are restrictions on redemptions.  For example, Barclays Arrival Plus card requires the charge to be at least $100 before you can redeem miles against it.  That means if you have only 9,900 Miles, you can?t redeem the points at all.  The Arrival card has a lower limit of $25.
- The high prices for premium class tickets means those redemptions are often out of reach.  A $7,500 First Class ticket would cost 750,000 Venture Miles, and very few people can accumulate that many Miles. 

#### When should you use Barclay/Capital One Miles

- When there are no other points that can be used.  For example, you can use Barclay Arrival+ to pay for a train ticket, and later redeem the points to reduce the cost.  You can?t do that with other points/Miles.
- When you find a great price on a ticket, but the price is not available through a bank portal.

### Using Southwest/JetBlue points

Southwest and JetBlue points are sometime referred to as ?fixed value? redemptions, even though they actually aren?t fixed.  In both cases, the amount of points needed to redeem for an award ticket is directly proportional to the price of the ticket being sold at that time, but the exchange rate is modified by the airline for various reasons that they don?t publish.  Typically, both Southwest and JetBlue points are valued between 1.4-1.7 cents per points.  To be clear, I have bundled these two points program together in this discussion since they are similar, but Southwest points can only be used to fly on Southwest, and JetBlue points can only be used to fly on JetBlue.  JetBlue points can also be used to redeem for flights with Hawaiian airlines also in a fixed value fashion.

To redeem these points, just goto the respective website, and search for the flight you want, with the option set to Use Points.  The airline website will tell you how many points it will cost, and as long as a seat is available and you have the points, you can redeem for it.  

#### Pros:

- As long as a seat is available, you can redeem points for it.
- The valuation is typically in a tight range, so you know how much your point is worth.
- You don?t have to study award charts or other complications.

#### Cons:

- In the cases where there are few seats left on a flight, airlines tends to raise the price of the last few tickets.  This means your points don?t go as far.
- Since the valuation is fixed, you probably won?t find any outsized redemption options.
- Ticket paid for by points will not earn additional points.

#### When should you use Southwest or JetBlue points?

- When you are flying Southwest or JetBlue, and you have enough points to redeem.  There is very little reason to hold these unless you have bigger plans for those points, such as a possible future JetBue Mint redemption.

My Plan:

1) My plan is to fly out of YYZ as I don't think there are direct flights out of any of the others.  I don't want to risk connecting flights in the winter (also, ROC and BUF are more likely to have delays due to lake effect snow). 

2) Using United Miles on Air Canada seems like the best bet for flights (at 35k per person round trip).  Does anyone see a better value?

3) I would book a suite at the Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall.  I believe it would cost 12.5k additional per night for the 5yo and the 2yo would be free.  Is this right?

4) Anyone who has been to Rose Hall Ziva or Zilara, will I have any issue with my children on the shuttle to resort RE: Car Seats?

awardhacker has flights on american airlines in economy for 35k rountrip and business for 55k roundtrip. The route should be JFK - SJU - EIS. Anyone with experience booking this route?

It looks like AA does not have direct flights to SJU from JFK when searching individual segments on the AA website. I have thought about doing a jetblue award flight (obtaining 3k jetblue miles is not a problem) for 2 people from JFK to SJU for 52,000 JBLU points (around 1.56 cpp). Then calling in to book AA partner flight on seaborne from SJU to EIS for 2 people roundtrip for a total of 30,000 AA miles, would like to use up my AA miles.

Jetblue Flight 1804 7:21PM departure from SJU, arrive at 10:27PM at JFK

How troublesome is it transferring between two airlines on one trip? Any concerns with the timing of the connecting flights?

I have seen commonly that people will fly into St thomas and it is a PITA to travel from there to EIS where the scrub island ferry will pick you up. I am trying to minimize the transfers reasonably.

Any tips on 7 nights in BVI would also be appreciated. Counting on ""breakfast amenity"" since program merger will go through of SPG and Marriott and I have platinum status.

Also, if anyone has any insight on what is the best way to book a flight from LAX to JFK, depart December 14, 2018, returning December 23, 2018 with the least amount of points, it would be appreciated. I am seeing some availability on the 14th for 12.5k points through airfrance, but remember reading some time ago air france will freeze accounts with no other activity on them. The problem I'm seeing is availability going back to LAX.

"4aymw5"|"Award Tickets 101: How To Find The Best Redemption"|"One of the questions that seems to come up a lot lately on this sub is ?how do I find the best redemption to X destination on my points/miles?? Since we have been getting the question almost daily, I decided to put together a 101 type of post on one of the processes for finding the best/least expensive redemption. You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days

Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

Your URs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days

Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

Airline | Alliance | Total Mileage Balance
:--------:|:--------:|:---------: 
Delta | SkyTeam | 109,000 Miles
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 110,000 Miles
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 65,000 Miles
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
American Airlines	 | OneWorld | 54,000 Miles
British Airways | OneWorld | 109,000 Miles
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 44,000 Miles
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 110,000 Miles
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qantas | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 175,000 Miles
United Airlines | Star Alliance | 99,000 Miles
EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for ?yyy Award Chart? (with ?yyy? being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you?re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this ? Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this ? Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control ? regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA?s award chart ? not LAN?s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the process that I use for determining the best redemption value for my points and miles, so hopefully it helps shed some light on how to find the best redemption value for your trip."

I'm looking to fly on a specific day (oct 6) from SFO to NYC.
Looking to fly in a lie flat preferably a red-eye/ evening flight.

I have 120kSPG, 600k UR, 200k MR.

I haven't flown transcon on any airlines and usually fly econ domestically but last time I flew to California i was exhausted after the flight. 

Any thoughts/suggestions? Any airline better than another for transcon? I was a bit unsure, but could I book that AA flight via BA using UR?

My home airport is JFK/EWR - I'm assuming I have to connect to get to either of these places, but I'm wondering which airline to try and get a business class ticket for through points.

Obviously these are measly point balances right now, but I hope to fatten them up before I book the tickets.

MR - 55,000
UR - 60,000
JetBlue - 57,000 (dunno if this helps, but I know they have some sort of partnership with Emirates & Singapore Airlines).

I would also like to try a carrier I have not flown international business class with. I've flown JAL business before - whilst it was the best flight I've been on (so far), I would like to try out another product.

So which carrier should I be dumping points into? (At the moment, I only have miles accounts with British Airways (oneworld), Flying Blue (SkyTeam), and Singapore Airlines (Star Alliance) - but creating an account with another MR/UR partner is no problem).

I am ideally looking for a cheap redemption (I don't care for business class but if the opportunity presents itself for just a smaller addition amount of points I would consider it) to anywhere in Europe, and from that destination I can pay out of pocket with low cost carriers to go to my wanted destinations of Naples, Florence, Athens, and Cyprus.

Can someone please let me know what would be the best flight award redemption to go to any of those places? And if it is possible, to use points in between for flights to the originating Asian country to the second Asian country?

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex?s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The ?high season? is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 ?high season? will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The ?low season? is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the ?low season? and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the ?high season?. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the ?low season? and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the ?high season?.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe ? especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific?s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions ? Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore?s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic?s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al?s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al?s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (?WS?) is January 1 ? March 24 and November 1 ? December 31, while the Summer Season (?SS?) is March 25 ? October 31.  El Al?s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan ? from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!"
"6outgd"|"First Time Redemption Help for Honeymoon"|"Hi friends,
Looking for help on my first award redemption, flights only. I have been accruing in anticipation of a late May 2018 honeymoon. We?re open to destinations if anyone wants to suggest anything. Departure airport would ideally be JFK but we could also do EWR/LGA. We?re really looking for 3-4 days to sit on a beach, 7-8 days of travel to a new country, back to LAX for a family event 1-2 days and then returning to NYC.  I am still in single-player mode but hoping this trip will awaken the fianc? to what churning can do. We're looking for economy the whole way to maximize the points. 


Here?s what we?re working with:


160k UR


89k JetBlue


67k Southwest



Based on my searches in UltimateRewards portal I know we're tight on the UR balance, but I'm thinking its better to book this early and pay a minimal cash fee rather than waiting closer to the dates.

Edit: Formatting &
Forgot to add what we had been looking at - It looks like we could eek out the trip through UR on Hawaiian Airlines for about 180k UR. JFK>HNL>Tokyo>LAX, using JetBlue to return from LAX>NYC."

"5py8hy"|"Trying to get 2 RT tickets to the Dominican Republic for my sister's honeymoon in November."|"So for my sister's wedding present I'm trying to get her 2 tickets (economy) to Punta Cana, DR from Williamsburg, VA (flying out of Richmond, Norfolk, or Newport News) for her 6 night honeymoon. She's a bit flexible with her dates so that's a plus. Her friend is also having a wedding during this period so she needs to be down there for 6 nights and have time to get to the rehearsal dinner and wedding between Thursday Nov 2nd, 2017 - Saturday Nov 4th, 2017. So as long as she there's for those dates the arrival and depature dates can flex a bit as long as it doesn't go over 6 nights.

I'm currently working with these points:

UR - 16k
MR - 31k
AA - 206k
Barclycard Arrival Plus- 57k 

I've tried pricing this out on Jetblue or SW (was thinking about picking up their card and using my arrival plus points for the other ticket) but the prices are the same. 

Unfortunately it looks like all the saver award space has been taken so flying out of Richmond with 1 stop on AA and back looks like it's going to cost me 55k + $110 in fees (I also have $200 in AA giftcards so that should take care of fees)... so 2x that'll be 110k + $220.. 

It looks like if she flies back Nov 8th or 9th the return tickets could only be 12.5k each, but unfortunately that'll mean she'll have to fly out the day of the rehearsal dinner and if something were to happen she'd miss it. I feel like 55k is a lot for one RT is pretty high... is this as good as it gets or am I (probably) missing something? "

"61ilct"|"SMF/SFO -> New York with [500K UR, 65K MR, 60K SPG, 60K RR, 30K AA] in mid-May 2017"|"Hello everyone!

I am looking to book a flight from SMF/SFO -> New York (open to any airport really, with slight preference to LGA) departing either 5/13 or 5/14 and returning 5/19-5/21.

I would prefer a non-stop flight, but I am open to a stop if needed!

Notes (I tried to do some due diligence beforehand and stretch my own award travel booking muscles, but ultimately could not figure out the best value redemption):

* It looks like JetBlue has some decent prices for a round trip flight from SMF->JFK (5/14-5/19 is $383 RT, so that's about 25K UR if I book through the Chase portal, but I value Chase UR as > 1.5 cpp)
* Southwest seems to have plenty of availability as well, but all the Southwest options have 1 stop and seem to be more expensive in terms of points than the JetBlue flights so it seems like an inferior option to JetBlue, at least for the time being

I originally thought about an open jaw korean air so I'd do an Lax->Inc->Osaka-> Lax, but turns out there's no direct Korean air flight from Osaka to LAX and I'd have to go through Incheon again which I'd rather avoid.
Maybe I should do one way Lax->inc->osaka korean air and then another airline from osaka->LAX?

The availability for my Hyatt Zilara Montego Bay trip is junk all-around.  Trip is booked for April 2nd (Sun)-6th(Thur) of 2017.  I have about 50k UR after a whoopsie mistake with United, but 133k in AA.  No access to SW cards at the moment unless my SO applied, but she wants to wait until January 2017 for CP from 1/1/17-12/31/19.

It looks like AA availability is just as bad.  Economy flights (15k) will only get us into MBJ on Monday, April 3rd and back to BOS on Fri April 7th, which doesn't work.  Business/First Class (25k) flights work for both the 4/2 and 4/6.  So, for me and my SO it would be 100k AA.  That leaves me 33k in AA left and then I'll get another 100k between Citigold and Citi Business, so no real loss there.

Has anyone used Biz/FC on AA before?  This is something I would have preferred to use on a longer flight but neither of us have flown Biz/FC before and this doesn't sound like the worst time to cash in on it.  Just looking for some feedback.  Thanks!"

My wife and I are trying to execute our dream trip to the Maldives this year.  For a few years, we've been planning to use ANA for business-class award tickets (2 roundtrip for 272k), but even though we've called nearly everyday since availability (T-331) opened for our desired dates (11/16-11/23), we unfortunately haven't found any availability.  

We'll keep trying -- but in the meantime I wanted to ask what other business-class routes we might consider.  Our significant points balances (including some domestic carriers that probably won't be of help) are below.  We also might be willing to open up a few more cards if we were reasonably certain that the points we'd get would lead to availability.  Thanks in advance for any help!

I know that's subjective, but I also know this isn't a high value use, but we don't care about first class redemptions - we'd earn and burn for as many trips in economy as we can. Also, we don't have any other travel through summer 2017 where we'd use these points, so they're just sitting there, taunting me.

My husband and I don't have as much travel flexibility as we'd like this year, so we're stuck trying for a short vacation over New Year's - when most of America has off. The other challenge is we first have to go to New York (JFK preferred, not EWR) to celebrate Christmas with family, and eventually end in SFO/OAK where we live. I prioritized nonstop flights to avoid getting stuck in some snowbound layover city.

I've been looking for a destination to spend 5 nights after Christmas through New Year's. I came up with New Orleans.

At all times the contractor is saying we can continue to live in our place -- we just may not want to, especially during the week. So I have been researching alternatives like airbnb, to fill in the times we may want to vacate the premises on short notice. I already travel a fair amount for business (about 40-50%).... and it occurred to me like a big d'oh that I could play this points game for free hotel stays... in our own town. 

I.e., no flights, just hotel stays, is our goal. We don't even care that much if it's a fancy hotel, as long as it's spackle free and close enough to work. 

Though I travel for work I have never really been interested in collecting points because long ago I used to be a couponer and I burned myself out on that game. I figured points were similar. But now I have motive... if even just for the short term.

I don't have a lot of points to start (about 40K Jetblue, 5K SPG), but I do have some travel coming up and will continue throughout the reno period. For work I nearly always stay at either a Starwoods or a Marriott. At home, we live in a big city with just about every option. I just signed up for Marriott Rewards and submitted some recent folios hoping they might comp me. I also signed up for the MR CC for the 80K points.

"526dpn"|"Favorite uses of SPG points?"|"After having met the minimum spends on both the SPG Personal 35k and SPG Business 35k, I'm sitting on 78k SPG points. I don't plan on earning anymore since they're so hard to earn and the bonuses are once per lifetime, and since the program may go away in the next couple years I figure I would run down my balance.

However, SPG points are the most valuable points currency in the world and I'm almost scared to use them. I've been doing a bit of research and I think some of the best hotel redemptions I've seen are at their lower end hotels...

The Aloft Cancun, for example, is a mid-range hotel in a prime location near all the luxury beach all-inclusive resorts (Ziva, Zilara, etc) in Cancun and rates can approach $200 a night at this hotel. As a Category 2 property, however, they require only 4,000 points a night, or 3,000 on the weekends. That can be 5+ cents per point in value!

JAL, a unique transfer partner of SPG, offers some great promotions, such as 30,000 miles roundtrip to Brazil on oneworld partner TAM. Given that roundtrips to Brazil from NYC are currently about $1,500 in economy, and you only need to transfer 25,000 SPG points to get 30,000 JAL miles, that's a value of 6 cents per point... 

I know a lot of people liked to transfer to Alaska for good redemptions in J/F on Emirates, but recent devaluations made this less appealing... if there are still good uses for transferring to Alaska, I'd like to hear about it...

If you were able to get in on the Virgin America+JetBlue points match promotion, then you could have gotten 50,000 Virgin America miles matched to 75,000 JetBlue miles for the cost of just 40,000 SPG points...

Even if you missed out on the Virgin America/JetBlue promotion, Virgin America has some great partner redemptions like 40k roundtrip in economy (35k SPG points) or 80k roundtrip (65k SPG points) roundtrip LAX-SYD on Virgin Australia...

I've heard about some great SPG Moments... but never really found one that I would want to use my precious SPG points for.

What else do you like using SPG points for that really sets it apart from other programs?"

Note 4: Wife got 50k Amex MR bonus in 2014, converted points to BA Avios during 1.4x redemption, card is cancelled. Neither of us have had the Amex platinum.

Note 5: We do not MS. I am open to the idea of the $15k LRCU account hack, though.

Note 6: FICO 812, income is good.

**My trip desires**

My wife is a teacher and I have decent vacation time. We'd like to do 3-4 weeks somewhere we haven't been before that won't break the bank with food/hotels. Ideal destinations include Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Budapest, all of Asia, India, all of Africa (esp S. Africa), all of Australia/NZ. Flexible travel dates late July/August 2016. Asia is probably highest on the list for both of us, but we're open.

It would be fun to move around a bit during the trip, but neither of us love flying so we mostly want to have one long travel day coming and going and minimize flying around once we're there. 1-2 additional flight days max during the trip. It would be fun to travel in business or first but we're not going to kill ourselves getting points to upgrade. 

I've never been to London and would be open to 3-4 days there even though it's an expensive city. But I'd rather not pay their enormous taxes on ""free"" flights.

Not interested in anywhere US, Canada, Caribbean, Latin America, or Eastern Europe for this trip - we want to go somewhere new :)

Home airport is Boston, easy enough to get to JFK via JetBlue points if necessary.

**Card thoughts**

Wife and I can probably swing one more card each this fall, depending on minimum spend. Then we can probably do another card each in the winter. So we want to put those cards towards points so we can redeem them early. In the winter we can probably each do another card, probably go for hotel cards at that point. Might go for a third set of cards next spring, again with hotel cards.

My original plan was to load up on Chase UR points by getting each of us a CSP. But that plan is now ruined thanks to the 5/24 rule.

I was then going to go for United points by going for the Chase United cards, but the 50k deals seem to have vanished except for business cards - I have a biz card via Ink, not sure if I can get the United biz card or not.

Looks like I missed the 100k Amex Platinum deal (I was on vacation using my SW companion pass, so I won't complain too much!).

Am still keeping my fingers crossed that the 140k RC offer comes back so we can do a fly + stay redemption.

I have zero use for airport lounge access, fee reimbursements, or most other perks. All I want is points.

**Questions**

Given my limited options to get more AA points, get Chase UR points via CSP, or get a decent stockpile of United miles, it seems like I should focus on BA. But I have never heard anything good about Avios except short haul (we don't want short haul for this trip) and have never had great experiences with their website. And since flying F or J on BA is now ludicrously expensive via points AND has huge surcharges on BA metal via London, I'm hesitant to go all in on Avios. So...

* Should I transfer my MR points to BA before the devaluation on 10/1?
* Should I go for the current BA card offer, recognizing that I don't MS and this might present an opportunity cost if some other better offer comes up?
* Are there other offers I'm missing that will help us have a truly memorable trip?
* If I do go all-in on Avios, is there some amazing routing/destination that will maximize my fun with Avios? I really don't care too much where we go next summer as long as it's new to us and beautiful.
* If I decide not to pursue Avios as a strategy, what's should I do instead?

Thanks!"

A churner and friend and I are looking to book a trip to Europe using award points. We are open to landing anywhere in continental Europe, but I have already been to Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Prague, so those places are less preferred. 

We would like to go to 4 different cities in Europe in 17 days. It is preferable that we have a one way in one city, and than a one way back from a different city. If it is much cheaper just to do round trip, then we can do that as well. Also we are willing to spend more points on business/first class if it is a great value. It's all about the value! We definitely want to go to Budapest, but other cities of interest are Krakow, Cyprus, Amalfi, Athens, Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, and somewhere in Switzerland.

I feel like the Park Hyatt in D.C. might be a good choice in terms of value (transferring UR to Hyatt), but the standard room might be a little small.

I was hoping to find a good deal but I haven't been lucky so far, like I have in the previous years. I currently have 300K UR points.

These are my flights:

* **#1:** 12/23 Boston (BOS) -> Phoenix (PHX) -> $493 (American)
* **#2:** 1/1 Phoenix (PHX) -> Denver (DEN) -> $119 (Southwest)
* **#3:** 1/4 Denver (DEN) -> Boston (BOS) -> $185 (Jetblue)

**Total: $797 (x2 for my wife - ouch!!).**

Let's break it down:

* 1) This flight is the most expensive of the 3. Way more than I have ever paid! The UR's website has the same flight for the same price of buying directly from American but it's also offering 33K points for it. I would use 66k points (me + wife) for it, instead of $986. I personally think it's much, right? What do you guys think?

* 2) This one could be cheaper, but it's ok. Southwest offers the same flight for 7K points (compared to $119). I have 4k with Southwest and my wife has 9K, so I would only have to transfer 3K points from my UR to Southwest. We don't mind using the points we have with Southwest for this trip, and 3K from my UR doesn't seem to much. Is this worth it?!?

* 3) Finally the last flight. UR's website is offering the flight for 12K points (compared to $185). Is this worth it?!?


I might be wrong, but I don't think it's worth spending 66K points on the first flight. But I could spend 3K on the flight #2 (and compliment with existing points in our Southwest accounts) and maybe (depending on what you guys say) another 24K for the flight #3.

Ideas? Suggestions? What should I do?? 

Thank you so much for your help.

"57xubs"|"Suggestions for cheap xmas/NYE vacation"|"A churner friend and I want to travel somewhere from December 23 - Jan 2 to use up our PTO. We could do December 24 - January 3 as an alternative. 

We are basically open to travel anywhere (Europe, Puerto Rico, caribbean, etc) and are looking for suggestions based on the points we have etc. What will make the most sense, fun, etc. 

Based on initial research it looks like Colombia could be the best option. It will cost $900 roundtrip from IAD to MDE (Medellin). Domestic travel within Colombia is cheap. $70 one way from MDE to Cartagena. Using points for this trip looks like a massive rip off, with Delta wanting 120k points roundtrip from IAD to Cartagena, and United having black out dates for January 2-3. 

Another potential option would be for us to fly to Ft. Lauderdale, relax for a few days around Miami, and then fly to Havana from Ft Lauderdale. The roundtrip flight from Ft. lauderdale to Havana is only about $400. I don't know how spending NYE in Havana will be however...

With that being said, it does NOT have to be colombia, but I have looked around the Caribbean, Europe, and South America, and everything looks to be a tremendous rip-off. When using points, I think I would be open to anything that is about 50-70k points for roundtrip. I still want to get relatively good value on my points. Otherwise I don't mind using cash, but again, I am looking for the best bargain.

Beyond NYC, part of our wishlist is to see Niagara Falls and then head over to Toronto (train perhaps, or take a short commuter flight from JFK or LGA or EWR).... continue on to Toronto (spend a 2-3 days or so) then fly back to LA (either from Toronto, or from Buffalo, or other suggested airports).

Train-wise, Amtrak quoted me around $305 for 6 passengers (an 8-hour train ride). Could possibly be a great experience, not exactly sure what scenery we will see from Manhattan to Buffalo. Or would it better to fly (for instance with JetBlue - total $318 for 6 of us. We will not be checking in any luggage, we travel with carry ons only.

This is the first time I will be redeeming reward points and I am in a bit of a dilemma. I would greatly appreciate any help. 

I have PTO planned for 17 days from 9/30/16 to 10/16/16. This vacation can move up a week to 10/6/16 to 10/23/16 if needed, however I wanted to make sure I get Columbus day in there as a Federal Holiday. 

I've been looking at flights and the reward flights suck getting to Lima. 

On 9/30, there is a 10:30am - 11:30am flight from DCA to Lima on JetBlue using 18.9k points + $20 fees. This flight is $320 out of pocket. *I would be transferring my Amex points to JetBlue*

On 10/16 - there is a 8am-9pm flight on AA using 17.5k points. I think this is a great deal. 

So getting to Lima is the problem. I waste an entire PTO day on Friday because of the flight time. There is an attractive option on Thursday to fly from 6:30pm -5:30am (arrive Friday morning) from AA, but AA is pricing that flight at 50k reward points. 

So I really have two options:

1) Pay $608 out of pocket for AA round trip for Thursday 6:30pm-5:30am (Friday morning) - this way I gain the entire Friday and it won't be wasted. 
- I have a $600 negative balance on my AA platinum card, so I could put the charge on there.
2) Use 18.9k JetBlue points (Transferred from Amex) and 17.5k AA points, and lose out on most of all of Friday. By the time I get from Lima Airport to my hostel, it will be midnight...

Points totals:
Amex - 150k
Delta - 60k
AA - 57k (but soon should be 82k after they credit me from AA gold card)
United - 75k
Chase Ultimate - 27k

We are based in NYC, so we have the luxury of being able to fly out of JFK, EWR, or LGA.

**Trip 1**

We would like to visit **Banff** and **Lake Louise**, since all the pictures we've seen are absolutely breathtaking. [[1],](https://images.trvl-media.com/hotels/1000000/20000/13700/13652/13652_81_z.jpg)[ [2]](https://images.trvl-media.com/media/content/shared/images/travelguides/Lake-Louise-10115-smalltabletRetina.jpg).

 - I am thinking that we fly into YYC, and rent a car to drive out to Banff (~1.5 hrs).
 - All of the flights seem to get in later in the day, so we will probably stay for one evening in **Calgary** (hotels seem relatively cheap, probably can do points + cash at a hyatt/ihg)
 - I?d really like to go here in **May**, because I love to golf and their [course](http://www.fairmont.com/banff-springs/golf/) looks awesome. (My SO does not golf, but I'm sure she'll do a yoga class or visit the spa).
 - Seattle had also been in our sites, although I hear it's rather expensive once you're there. Nonetheless, I'd love to take the ferry around to the different islands, and rent a car to visit **Olympic National Park** and **Mt. Rainier**. I'd originally wanted to do a quick trip out here back in March, but realized it's best to see these parks in the warmer months. 
 - This trip would most likely be for 7-8 days, or just 4 if we only go to Canada.

Originally I was thinking to book the flights to Calgary through American (**30k each roundtrip**), but some of connections are a little ridiculous (SEA + LAX in the return to NYC?)

 - Cash tickets are also only ~**$350-375**, so **1.1-1.2 cpm** isn't that great.
 - Thinking it would be better to book through **Alaska** using cash and the **companion pass***, but am not sure if I can book a multi-day layover in Seattle.

**We'd love to go to Hawaii, and realize this is probably the best use of the Alaska companion pass. However, Hawaii is extremely expensive, and we feel we'd enjoy our time better there in a few years when we have a little more money.*


**Trip 2**

We'd also really like to go to Southeast Asia, and see **Bangkok**, **Phuket**, **Saigon**, and **Singapore**. Looks beautiful, and it all seems relatively cheap once you?re there. 

 - I?d like to hit Bangkok for 1-2 days (have a friend teaching there, so i'd like to pay him that visit I?ve been promising him.
 - Some other places we?d like to see are **Phang Nga Bay** and **Pattaya**, **Ko Samui**, **Phuket**, and **Ko Phi Phi** (really touristy, but so beautiful)
 - For this trip we?d be able to go for **10-15 days**, the hotels are all really cheap so this saves us a lot.
 - I am weary of the rain starting to pick up (May-Aug seems bad), so we?d like to do this trip ASAP
 
Seems we'd need to fly into HKG, PEK, NRT, or SIN to get a flight to BKK or HKT.  Another option is take Qatar and transfer through DOH. 

  - I heard you can?t do much on a layover in NRT, so we?d rather transfer through SIN or even HKG (and maybe do a day trip).
  - It seems each leg is **40k** on United, so that would be **160k** between the two of us...
  - This seems like a really bad redemption, as I?m seeing flights for 650-700 round trip (0.8 cpm).
  - The only way I could justify it, was if we got some sweet open jaws that allow us to visit SIN, BKK, HKT, and/or SGN on the same ticket, but idk if that?s possible


A friend who?s been living/teaching in Korea suggested scrapping Thailand and just going to **Bali**, so I was wondering if anyone had any input on awards flights there.  I've researched the destination and agree it's awesome, but it may need to wait for another time.  Would be nice to do some sort of open-jaw/extended layover in **SIN** or **SYD** with a connection to **DPS**, but not sure if this is possible.

**Other Ideas**

Part of us wants to see the world while were young, and another part just wants some nice R&R. We used our two free nights at the Hyatt Regency in Aruba and had a ***blast***. We paid ~$500 in advance to book a third night, but were upgraded to an room oceanfront room that goes for $650/night! We made some newb mistakes like forgetting sunscreen ($15 in gift shop?), but overall it was a great time!

 Another trip we were considering was flying into Cancun and staying at the [**Fairmont Mayakoba**](http://www.fairmont.com/mayakoba-riviera-maya/). Flights to CUN are really cheap (especially on JetBlue), and we could get lucky using the room + suite upgrades. I saw generally good reviews on FT, and there?s also a PGA [golf course](http://www.mayakobagolf.com/course.html) next door? I am not sure if we?d do an all inclusive here (5 nights is a lot), but we may stay for 2 nights and see if we can get a suite upgrade. The other days we rent a car to visit Tulum, and maybe backtrack and stay a night in Cancun.

*Yet another* trip is **Costa Rica**, but this also does not seem like a good place to use miles/points. We could fly in relatively cheaply to Liberia or San Jose (JetBlue has great deals to LIB), and can get around to the different destinations via [Nature Air ](http://www.natureair.com/) (flight + sight seeing in one). 
We would go to the Arenal Volcano Area, but also have also heard Manuel Antonio National Park is really cool as well.  This place looks awesome, but there seems like so much to hit. I don?t mind faring towards the more touristy areas, I heard some parts of the country don?t have paved roads and you could kill a whole day in traffic/getting lost. I?d love to do some all inclusive travel tour that takes care of all that stress for you, but the price is out of our budget for now.


**Final Note**

I realize this post is really long, and probably not the best organized, so thank you for reading it. I don't want to be one of those people who collects points and never uses them, but I also don't want to waste them. It's my understanding the real value is in business/first, but I also hope there's value to be had in economy/coach.

**Edit**

I am aware of close-in booking fees, and too my knowledge the changing the date trick doesn't work anymore (except maybe for Untied?). This is *yet another* reason why cash might be better for Asia, but any input is greatly appreciated!"
"4k2ioj"|"Frustrated by Amtrak Guest Rewards"|"Ever since Chase lost Amtrak as a UR transfer partner (coinciding with Amtrak switching to a revenue-based rather than zone-based award system), I've really been missing the ability to take quick trips from NYC to DC, PHL, or BOS using my points.

I'm considering signing up for the two Bank of America cards which offer 20,000 and 12,000 Amtrak points respectively, but I'm concerned about how Amtrak has redeveloped its award program.

They advertise 'no blackout dates', but this seems to be a false promise. For example, when looking for a train from NY Penn to Washington, DC on 9/2, which is admittedly around Labor Day (peak travel period), there are tons of redemptions that are listed as 'No Price', meaning no award availability: http://i.imgur.com/JI9hwwV.jpg They are not sold out, however, plenty of revenue fares are still available: http://i.imgur.com/cOmd2VK.jpg

I was under the impression that one of the points [no pun intended] of a revenue-based frequent rider program (like JetBlue and Southwest) is that as long as there is a seat available on the flight, you can book it with points, it's just that peak period and expensive revenue tickets will cost more points. Seeing dates four months away with 'no availability' on a revenue-based frequent rider program seems ridiculous to me.

For the 'No Price' redemptions, Amtrak says:

>""No Price"" is displayed for Redemption Booking
>
>During peak travel periods when demand is high and capacity is limited, some departures are available at a higher point cost and some seats or classes of service may not be available for redemption. Amtrak Guest Rewards members with Select Plus(SM) and Select Executive status may find expanded access to use their points for travel during those peak times. For best results, we recommend members log in to their Amtrak Guest Rewards account before searching for available itineraries.

So it seems that they are blacking out certain trains for non-elite members, which is ridiculous on a revenue-based frequent rider program. If I want to spend more points for a more expensive ticket, what's the problem?

I have used some of the points already to book a trip for my parents and they paid me a cent per point. I'm happy to keep them on tap, and getting a cent per is fantastic, but I've been thinking about liquidating them a little sooner.

"5yr27h"|"Help with BOS-->KTM booking please"|"I'm planning a trip to Nepal / Bhutan for myself, my wife and two young children. We are looking to minimize stops and flight duration on account of the kids. One child I need to buy a ticket for the other is a lap infant.

Needs: 2 tickets (my wife, my 2 year old, and a lap infant, but my ticket will be reimbursed by work)  
Class: economy 
The Bhutan Ticket will be purchased as a separate RT ticket KTM--Paro 

I like the BOS--KTM Emirates flight and the BOS--KTM Qatar airlines flight. 

This is what I have: 
320,000 UR Points 
50,000 American miles 
75,000 Delta skypesos
10,000 JetBlue miles 
(62,000 United miles - but need to pay $250 to get them reinstated, as an aside is this worth it ?) 

I am not in need of using points for these Nepal flights but maximizing the value of my UR points is a priority. so if that means buying these Nepal tickets no problem and using UR points through the portal at a later time - that's fine. 

To me the best options by itinerary are these one stop options:
1.) Emirates (short layover in Dubai, PP lounge) 
2.) Qatar (long layover in Doha, would require a hotel) 

Emirates doesn't appear in the chase portal and Qatar airlines does but not a good itinerary (longer layover). 

Questions:

If I purchase Emirates or Qatar airlines can i earn miles in a partner that's useful to me ? Or are miles earned at such a low rate it's not worth considering ? 

**Is there some transfer of miles I'm missing that would allow me to purchase the Emirates or Qatar ticket at a rate better than the standard Chase UR discount ? **

"2w3qzg"|"BA/AA award travel JFK-SJU"|"Hi all, 
This is a semi-award/semi-churning post but I figured the main question belongs here. Goal is to take the SO on a trip to San Juan. We'll be leaving from NYC and want to know what the best way to get there via points is. 

Based on my research so far, I'm thinking either Jetblue or AA is our best bet for non-stop flights (which would be ideal). With Jetblue's program we would pay about 44000pts+fees for 2xroundtrip in mid july whereas for AA (booked with avios) we would pay 40000+fees. Our dates are pretty flexible; anytime in July but only July. The nice thing about Jetblue is that if there is a seat available, you can get it whereas there aren't many award seats left on AA. 

Assuming I can meet the minspend in the 1st month, should I go for Amex PRG and transfer pts to jetblue or maybe go for the chase BA and book thru avios? What is award availability for SJU routes on AA/BA like in the summer? Any other thoughts on award travel JFK-SJU?

I currently have the following cards:

Chase SWA with 35000pts

Barclays A+ working towards min spend

Citi AA plat select just approved 


I have kinda earmarked the AA points for a different trip so I wanted to add one more card as I mentioned above (obviously what I have now wouldn't get me too far)."

I have ~200K UR points, 50K US Airlines miles, ~100K southwest. 
 
My plan is for myself and my SO to fly into SJO around 3/17/15, stay a week to attend a wedding, then fly to LIM for another couple of weeks.  

So far my research suggests that getting ourselves from SMF, or SFO to PHX which is a ""sweet spot"" for using Avois miles and then being able to book for 12.5K Avois miles, but I'm having difficulty actually figuring out if this actually will work, and the SJO-LIM seems to be the hiccup.  I used this as a guide: http://travelisfree.com/2013/06/18/best-use-ba-avios/

I'm also considering that maybe United is the way to go as the Star Alliance Route Map shows SFO-LIM stopping at SJO after routing through Chicago, and LAX-LIM through SJO.  Does anyone have any input or experience with this or a similar plan? Thanks for any input. 

**TL:DR**

* 200K UR points, various other SW, US and JetBlue points.
* Flying from CA (SMF, SFO, LAX?) to LIM (or other Peruvian airport)
* Stopover in Costa Rica for a week (SJO or LIB) 
* Timeframe: Middle of March
* Current Plan: Either SMF to PHX and Avois miles from there or Star Alliance flight with Stop Over in SJO (~40K miles)

"dljr4y"|"Scary/awesome landing today"|"Wanted to throw some love to the delta team today. Flight DL 2872 from SAN to SLC was diverted to LAX because our landing gear got stuck in the down position after take off. Let me tell you, no imagination suffices to express the fear that ANY problem with landing gear yields while airborne. The crew and the pilots kept the cabin amazingly calm and after a nice little tour (40 laps) above San Diego, we landed in LA due to their longer runway. The pilots absolutely buttered the landing and all was without issue (bonus points for a full emergency crew greeting on the runway). Never been happier to fly with a specific carrier than I was after we rolled to a stop and the pilot came over the PA to appraise us of what happened. Fly delta jets 4 life!
Anyhow, never take a landing for granted. Fly safe everyone."
"dgmczv"|"Question about flying with an Autistic child"|"So we're thinking of visiting Chicago in April and it would be my son's first flight. He'll be almost 6 at the time but he's Autistic. He loves car rides so as long as there's movement he's good. We'd also bring his tablet and lots of snacks. The flight is relatively short as well.

Here's my issue:
JetBlue is usually the preferred airline option for most families with Autism. In our situation I weighed the costs vs pros/cons. My husband and I are both big - he's over 6 feet but we're also heavier. If we did JetBlue we'd have to get very specific flights so the plane was 3x2 or 3x3 so we'd be together, and Economy seats are pretty tight. 

The other option is Delta.

Delta has a Canadair Regional Jet 900 that they use for NYC to Chicago flights. In First Class that's 1x2 seats. 

Taking cost into account I realized the difference between Economy JetBlue and First Class Delta was only $150 difference! Delta would mean significantly more room, less people to possibly disturb, and a flight attendant much closer if we needed anything. I'd also inform the airline ahead of time that he has Autism.

My question is this: has anyone taken a First Class flight with a child? I know I'm paying for a service but I don't want to get nasty looks from other passengers, as that's a real issue when we're out in public. He's pretty well behaved in that it's not like we let him run around screaming and hitting people, but he could potentially get scared during takeoff and landing and he could stim at times.

Is it generally frowned upon to seat a child in First Class? 

Has anyone flown with an Autistic child on Delta? If so, how was your experience, especially if you've also flown JetBlue."

They claim that the price often rises, but falls back as the dates get closer.  

Help me not panic that I missed the best deal.  So far, the best times and dates for us have risen by $500 total.  Also, since JetBlue doesn't really have a deal for round trip, should I grab the return flight now that it is at a good price and monitor just the outgoing flight price?

Because I will be there for three months, I am having to pack as much as I can (including bedding) but I'm running into some trouble. My checked bag that I plan on bringing is about 60 pounds, meaning it is overweight and I will have to pay $100 instead of $25. I noticed that I could bring a second checked bag for $35. If I decided to bring 2 checked bags under 50lbs, would I only be paying $60 or am I just not understanding the baggage fee?"

The flight from DFW to Boston was cancelled, resulting in a full 24 hour delay. I'm not 100% sure of the cause of the cancellation, something mechanical problem with the plane. But the cancelled flight was operated by JetBlue. Since I bought the ticket on an EU airline with a destination in the EU, am I covered under their compensation rules?

Just looking for third party opinions about having a travel card vs an airline card as your main credit card.

"9crzp1"|"Advice on which rewards plan/airline to utilize"|"Hello,

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed.
Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.
Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts. Not from a morality stand point, thank you; I can make that decision myself and don't need the internet's thoughts on right and wrong. I'd like to hear if anybody knows how this will play out.

Since these flights will be during the winter, and sometimes the winters up here in the northeast can get wild, and snow can fall once a week, I was wondering what would happen to my flight if my first flight with JetBlue got canceled because of weather conditions.

Long story; I had one flight before that had to be delayed because of a snow shower that happened the night before the flight. Gladly I had enough time during the layover to get to my next flight and didn't have to get anything rebooked but either way I was flying with 1 airline not with multiple airlines. 

So let's say it snows the day of my flight and they have to send me on the next possible plane or send me the day after. What would happen to my next 2 flights that are with LATAM? As it would be LATAM's responsibility had that flight been a LATAM flight, would there be a way to get my other 2 flights rebooked since it wouldn't be LATAM'S responsibility?"

So I'm currently sitting in the Denver Airport, settling in to spend the night here until 10 am. 

My flight was suppose to leave at 11:59 pm on Oct 16. But instead a pilot called in sick, apparently only an hour before the flight was suppose to leave and without the second pilot we are unable to leave. 

From my understanding, they attempted to find another pilot but we're unable so now they have to fly in a new crew in the morning. 

So instead of meeting my connecting flight at 6am. I now leave here at 11 am, reach the connecting airport at 430 pm and then get on my new connecting flight at 1030 pm to reach my destination 13 hours later then I originally was suppose too. 

I picked JetBlue because I've previously had no issues with them, in fact my next flight in Nov is booked with them. Something which I regret and I'm almost thinking of cancelling and rebooking with any other airline. 

And tbh, I'm not entirely angry because of the delay. It's frustrating and annoying but what really gets me, is the refusal to get people a place to stay. This isn't a 3 hour delay or even a delay during the day where people have access to transportation, food, etc. It's 2 am and most of us don't live here. We have no place to stay.

Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed. 

Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.

Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts.

"9tk6iu"|"Jetblue vacations - corporate discounts? Any corporate employees?"|"Do Jetblue corporate employees get access to crazy vacation deals? My friend Kate has been booking vacations through an acquaintance Judy who's friend Charles works for Jetblue corporate. Charles sends Judy these insane vacation deals and Judy passes them on to her friends. When I say insane, I mean like 7 day, all inclusive Caribbean trips (to major resorts) for like $600 including flights and airport transfers. Judy requires cash for the trips, apparently sends the money to Charles who books the trips using his corporate card. The trip vouchers are good for 2 years and you can cancel a booked trip up to 30 days before for a full refund. The prices drop even more if 10+ tickets are purchased.

Something just doesn't seem right. It seems too good. Kate says Judy has be ""doing this for years"", has been a member of the community for 30 years and if she was scamming people, it would be known. I don't know anyone personally that has actually taken a trip but Kate has her first one coming up in November. I know 3 others taking trips in the next few months. Judy claims she doesn't get anything out of it, I would almost believe this more if she just admitted she gets a % cut. Kate asked if this was a timeshare thing and would need to sit through a presentation, Judy said no. Again, I would believe this more if that were the case. For this price, there has to be a catch.

Kate has purchased 4 vacations but my skepticism now has her nervous. If Judy were to get hit by a bus tomorrow, how would all these people reach Charles to book there trips or get refunds? How can Charles just book vacations for all these people? If you show interest in a trip, Judy jumps right on it and then you need to give her money immediately for this great deal. Something just doesn't smell right and I'm wondering if there are any current or former JB corporate employees out there that can vouch for getting amazing vacation deals that can be shared with friends.

The only articles of clothing I have a receipt of were a air of pants and a sweater from Banana Republic that I had purchased before flying. The only other receipts I had were for my electronics which included a PS4 and a headset as well as three games. So I wrote those down. 

They call me today to tell me that they only compensate for essentials and not electronics so I explained that I have no other receipts and was told that I still had to write the items with the date of purchase and price. When I asked what I should do if I don?t know either of those things, the dude just repeated the thing instead of answering my question. 

They also said that they?d reimburse me for items that I needed to buy due to my lost luggage but only if I bought them within five days after the claim in made. I was way past the five day mark so I can?t even get reimbursement for the new clothing I had to buy. 

So all in all, I have nothing to show to get any reimbursement and I don?t know what to do. I?m a college student with a minimum wage job. I don?t have the money to replace all my lost items. And some were hand made. I don?t know what to do at this point.

I never before had issues with Jetblue, but this past trip was a vacation that almost tanked because of the travel and had me not wanting to ever use them again.  Each of the 4 flights I had going and coming was delayed if not once, several times, then the final returning leg, after being delayed multiple times, even while sitting on the airplane for an hour, was cancelled just before midnight with no other flights going out to my destination until late the next evening.  This forced me, my co-passengers and possibly passengers from what looked like another cancelled Jetblue flight to seek answers and alternatives for what to do at such a time of being stranded.  Many of us were not treated sufficiently and were not presented with acceptable options, which is ridiculous.  Many were families with small children, and by the time I got to a desk to speak to someone and ask questions of what was to happen and what available options were, we were told ""their"" hotels had sold out and the nearest would be an hour away and we would have to find one ourselves, but they would provide transportation.  There's much more to this, but long story short, I ended up staying at a nearby motel to keep costs low in the worst case of being totally rejected and not refunded or compensated for whatever reason, but I still find it reprehensible I was put in this position.  

I want to write a letter explaining this, but I don't want to send it to the wind or to some general or automated email address that will never read it.  Has anyone had success with complaints?  I've heard the telephone method is not good and some have said only the desk can do certain things, but even they were calling managers or whoever to answer questions we had.

* They have a handy menu of their drinks and snacks in the seat-back pockets.  On some flights they also read out the list.  I recommend the Doritos Munchies Mix.  
* The seats are comfy!  (leather-like, not hard at all, lots of give)
* Don't expect to borrow a blanket or pillow for free.  You have to buy them for $7.  And if the plane's not full, it will be cold!
* They have cable TV and satellite radio, unlike other airlines with movie selections.  Don't forget your earphones; theirs cost $2.
* You can watch a sneak preview of a tv pilot if you want (at least you could last week).  Called something like ""Modern Family.""  Up to you guys, but I tried a few minutes and found it to be god-awful.

Some things I'd be curious to keep track of:

* How many pilots crack jokes?  (mine were 1 of 4; on my last flight the Pilot said, ""We have two of our best Flight Attendants with us today.  And we have Stephanie.""  That put a big grin on her face as she repeated for people in the next 10 minutes that yes, she was Stephanie.)   
* How much of the time do they use their little map-channel where you get to follow where the plane is?  (3 of 4 on mine)  
* How often were flights delayed?  (none of mine in any way)  
* How often did flights land early? (I think 2 of mine did.  Between 10 and 30 min early)"

"d3epe"|"Reddit Underground Railroad for JetBlue Travelers (Crosspost from /r/AskReddit)"|"We once had an Underground Railroad to free our brothers and sisters from the unjust society and culture imposed upon them. A rough network of collaborators helped to make this happen. The conductors of this railroad risked their livelihood and, most likely, their lives to look beyond societal norms of the day and set out to inform and rescue those who needed it most. The unnamed stations that served to hide those who desired freedom. 

We now have a chance once again to rescue those who yearns for freedom from the daily doldrum of modern living. For the lifers who wake up early in the morning before sunrise and look out to the night for some sign of inspiration that never seems to come. For those who zombies through the daily grind of life, whether it be coursework or corporate, hoping to be reanimated at the end of the day only to be pitched back to the brainless life once the alarm goes off the next day. For they who grasped at their final chance to experience a nomadic life that comes once in a lifetime...or in this case, for the past 2 years. 

I propose we make a _Reddit Crosscountry Highway_ for those who have taken the the JetBlue Challenge and is using it to live life simply on the road. To allow those who want to escape or just to enjoy a new way of living for this brief period.

**For Travelers:**

* *Meeting stations:* Suggest an airport hub or prominent city location to act as a meeting spot for those who desire to travel with another redditor for one leg of the journey and/or beyond
* *Waypoints/Points of Interests:* Suggest a point of interest or event you know coming up that other people taking the journey might enjoy
* *People of interest*: Introduce people you've met on your journey that doesn't use Reddit/don't know about this Highway to those that come to the city after you. (This might need to be done exclusively through PMs as a protection barrier)

**For those not on the journey but inclined to help the travelers:**

* *Agents* to act as guides, willing to show those who visit around their city or even just to offer suggestions on where to go
* *Rest stations* for those who are weary at the end of day: A generous redditor willing to offer up their residence to those who are traveling for the night


Suggestions needed and are quite welcomed.

If you want to be considered to receive the unlimited Jet Blue ticket and spend a month running Redditors' errands and eating bacon in exotic locales, please contact me on AIM (same as my Reddit username) or PM me for an email address. I will want to talk to you by phone to confirm you're a real person. I'll also ask for a picture of you holding up a doodle of the Reddit alien or something like that in order to make sure you're not just human but also who you say you are. Finally, and most invasively, I'll need some personal references who can vouch for your sanity and tendency to behave yourself as a guest.

Yeah, it's a pain, but we're giving you a month-long trip of awesome for it. If you're worried about me using your personal information for evil rather than good, you can ask Redditor Lycurgus to confirm that I'm real and sane.

So a few years ago, like in 2007 or something, I had purchased a round trip ticket from Jet Blue from Long Beach, CA to JFK or LGA (I forgot which it was, but it was NY).  I was scheduled to return to Long Beach on Monday, leaving at 6am in the morning.  At around 11 pm at night, as I am sleeping, I get a phone call.  I finally decide to answer it but it's already gone to voicemail.  Turns out to be a recorded message saying ""due to weather conditions, your Jet Blue flight has been cancelled.  Please check jetblue.com to reschedule your flight"".  So I immediately log on to jetblue and discover that ALL the flights to Long Beach are booked until WEDNESDAY.  So i call them and beg them to get me on a flight because I have to get to work on Monday.  Sorry, they say, we are booked until Wednesday.  What's that?  Oh, sorry we don't partner with other airlines so we can't get you on another flight with anyone else.  What's that? Oh, I'm really sorry, I know it's not raining but it might be tomorrow morning.  What's that?  Oh, don't worry, we will refund you the unused portion of your ticket. 

God I was pissed.  I had to go to Delta to get a flight out at 5pm and got back to Los Angeles at 11 pm and I paid $800, that was the CHEAPEST one way ticket they had for Monday.  Jet Blue refused to re-imburse me for it.  The worst part of it was that Delta is based out of LAX.  So after I got back, I had to hail a cab to drive me to Long Beach to pick up my car at Jet Blue.  They even refused to pay for that!  I was so mad I called them after fuming about it for a few days and they gave me a link and told me to fill out my complaint (or send an email to someone, I forgot, it was a while ago) so I did that and they sent me a $50 gift voucher for a future Jet Blue flight.  Sorry, that's the best we can do sir.

Yesterday I was looking for flights back home to Boston from DC for next week. I found several on JetBlue for $69, one flight leaving every hour or two. They weren't flagged as having only a few seats left, as some flights on other airlines were. Once I confirmed with the rest of my party that this arrangement worked, I went to buy the tickets, but now they're $166, and have been since last night. It's showing the same price and same flights on every aggregator site as well as on the JetBlue site.

What exactly happened here? Did they just happen to raise the price? Do they sell a certain number of $69 seats and then the rest are full price? I'm assuming I'm SOL and will be paying $166, but just wanting to know how JetBlue pricing works for future reference."

Did they get lucky?"|"My mother called me earlier tonight explaining this situation. For some reason she thought their flight to Orlando left from Boston around 8PM. I think she somehow mixed up this flight for a different one they had booked for my brother a few weeks before. They got to Logan really early, sometime between 4PM and 5PM, and when she pulled up their booking she realized their flight was actually from Hartford at around 6PM. It was too late at that point to make it to Hartford for that flight. They spoke to a woman at the JetBlue counter who was able to put them on a flight from Boston to Ft Lauderdale departing at 9:15PM, which they?re on right now as I?m writing this. They?ll have to drive a little further to get to where they?re staying, but I?m thinking that?s a small price to pay for a mistake like this. The agent had also put them on standby for an earlier flight to Orlando, their original destination, but there ended up being no room, so they took that later flight to FLL. JetBlue also re-booked the return flight into Boston as well.

I?m basically just wondering if this is standard procedure for airlines to do something like this? When she had first called me and was explaining what happened, my first thought was they were out all of the money for their original flight and return. I was pleasantly surprised to here otherwise. I?m not sure if they just got lucky, but either way, good on JetBlue for bailing them out.

The 338 was for a late night flight, and the earlier flights on Christmas Day are in the mid 400s.  Thanks!"
"dg076p"|"Travel Insurance / Options for Political Unrest"|"I am supposed to go next week to Ecuador. But given all thats been going on (protests on the streets, transportation network shut down etc) i am reconsidering going there.

Unfortunately, none of the companies i have booked my stay/travel with seem to think these are extenuating enough circumstances to help refund me. We have 2 months of stay via Airbnb and tickets into the country, and no one thinks that a) the US embassy travel warning not to come to Ecuador b) numerous reports of violence c) complete shutdown of public transportation (so going in and out of cities would be difficult) is enough to refund our trip. We even called our travel insurance company and they said the same thing..

Im wondering if anyone else had experiences like this and how they were able to navigate the different companies policies (Airbnb, Jetblue, Chase for travel insurance) to get a refund? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. This is such a mess!"

"7utzwt"|"JetBlue lost my luggage and I?m probably not getting"|"Im probably not getting compensated. I flew from San Francisco to NYC on on December 18th which is when I made the baggage claim. They haven?t located my bag so I had to fill out papers with information on my lost luggage. The second page asked for a list of items in my luggage and their receipts. They were all old clothing that I don?t have proof of purchase anymore or the memory of where I bought them. The only articles of clothing I have a receipt of were a air of pants and a sweater from Banana Republic that I had purchased before flying. The only other receipts I had were for my electronics which included a PS4 and a headset as well as three games. So I wrote those down. 

They call me today to tell me that they only compensate for essentials and not electronics so I explained that I have no other receipts and was told that I still had to write the items with the date of purchase and price. When I asked what I should do if I don?t know either of those things, the dude just repeated the thing instead of answering my question. 

They also said that they?d reimburse me for items that I needed to buy due to my lost luggage but only if I bought them within five days after the claim in made. I was way past the five day mark so I can?t even get reimbursement for the new clothing I had to buy. 

So all in all, I have nothing to show to get any reimbursement and I don?t know what to do. I?m a college student with a minimum wage job. I don?t have the money to replace all my lost items. And some were hand made. I don?t know what to do at this point.

We specifically booked an evening flight on a smaller plane to not have to fly early in the morning, but that's fine I guess.  Problem is, we booked our hotel through them from jet blue vacations.  So now they leave us on a Friday night in new orleans with no place to stay and hotel prices at last minute, weekend, nosebleed rates when we specifically planned our vacation to avoid weekend flights and hotel rates.  After 3 hrs on the phone with customer service  (which was of no help at all) the lady at the airport was the only one who was helpful and we were able to arrange with our previous hotel a new room, luckily despite already being checked out.  Now as we are finally flying back after having to pay for another night ourselves which we didn't want, on a weekend which we didn't want, on a morning flight which we didn't want, they throw us in the back of a packed plane in seats we had no opportunity to pick ourselves despite our previous flight plan, that have fallen apart and aren't even attached to the frame, which I'm sure is an faa violation of some kind, with a tv that doesn't work.

My parents wanted to do a last big family vacation for the family before they ended up with too many grand children to make it feasible. They rented a villa for march break (2020, March 14 - March 21st) and asked us to book our flights. It needs to be march break as my sister is a teacher and it her only time off outside of Christmas that isn't during hurricane season. We were checking flights yesterday and were shocked to realize Westjet had no flights available to Pearson (YYZ. We checked air Canada that only had preferred seating for the departing flight and Business class for the return (at an extortionate total cost of $8,300 for two adults and a child). Checking Skyscanner only shows terribly long layovers that make no sense.

&#x200B;

Montreal has 0 flights for the return for west jet and no direct for air canada. I'm wondering if it's related to the 737 max grounding. Just checked buffalo and their flights are even longer layovers (4 days of travel total) for total of $5k. There are flights available the week of March 28th so it is not that it is too early.

&#x200B;

Using google flights , I can find a westjet roundtrip for $3,500 but when I click to book, it direct me to the westjet site and informs me it is not available. I can't believe that everything is already booked up. I know west jet usually uses the 737-700 during regular weeks maybe they switch to the max during peak seasons, which they cannot show as available due to the grounding maybe?

&#x200B;

This cannot be right, does anyone have any insight into whats going on? I am waiting for a response from westjet."

**Saturday**

Flew JetBlue from New York to Cancun because we got a good deal. Flight was delayed a few hours, but we got some travel credits, which was much appreciated. The original plan was to pick up a rental car from Hertz at the airport, but due to the flight delay, they were closed when we arrived. However we reserved the car through AmEx, and they helped move the reservation to pickup the next day. So when we landed, we went straight to the hotel through a cab at the airport. We chose the official partner (maybe SuperShuttle? Forgot to document this). The ride seemed expensive for what it was, but was ultimately fine.

We wanted to stay somewhere easy to get to, efficient, clean, and downtown/not in the hotel district, and chose Suites Malecon Cancun. This was a BIG MISTAKE. When we arrived and went into our room, whoever was there previously had smoked in the bathroom and it smelled horribly. Tried to steam/air it out, but only succeeded a little bit. There were stains on the bedspread and lampshade. The air conditioner was difficult to figure out, and ultimately made the room pretty cold. But all this could have been forgiven if the room had sufficient soundproofing. My guess is that the hotel was built in a hurry, and they did a shoddy job. Even though we were on the 14th floor, with the windows closed, metal window gates closed and A/C running, we could still hear the bars across the street. Even worse, there was some kind of fun run event that started before dawn across the street that featured loudspeakers blasting music to get the runners motivated. We could also hear other guests in their rooms talking and when they dropped things on the floor. It was very frustrating not to get any sleep after the delayed flight.


**Sunday**

The next annoying hurdle was Hertz. Even though we reserved a car online, they said since we didn't pre-pay, they didn't have to honor the reservation for the car we wanted. All they had available was a Dodge Grand Caravan. It was much bigger than we needed, and ended up costing us more in gas than a regular car would have. But it drove nicely, and the A/C worked well.

The drive to Merida was mostly uneventful. Took the tollway most of the trip, which was fast and had no traffic. Got stopped on the Yucatan/Quintana Roo border by a federale. He let us go through without hassle (queue foreshadowing music). Stayed in Koox Art 64 Boutique Hotel in El Centro. Generally a nice place with very helpful employees and lovely pool. Room had good A/C, huge TV, cute patio, large closet, safe, comfortable/pillows, and ceiling fan. Downsides were that there was no bathroom door, not great soundproofing (birds, neighboring children), no fridge in room, and it seemed relatively easy for bugs to get in. The room was upstairs, and there was a shared kitchen and living room downstairs.

Checked out Merida en Domingo that day, which was really fun. Traditional dancing, tons of vendors and people around. Had a sopa de lima snack from one of the stands, which was kind of weak. Went for lunch to Manjar Blanco. Very tasty. Tried panuchos, papadzules, and relleno negro. Rest of the day was spent walking around, swimming and checking out thing around town.

For dinner, went to Tikin Xic on the north side of town. Food was good, cheap, and the staff was nice. Great botanas and ceviche. The namesake dish was good too. After, checked out the funk/blues jam at Dzalbay. It was decently fun.

I guess it's at this point that I'll also mention something that seems pretty obvious, and it's that Merida is HOT. Even in February, it was 90s during the day. And a lot of places don't have A/C, probably because most people are used to it.


**Monday**

Lots more walking around and city exploring. Had some breakfast tacos at Taqueria La Lupita. They were excellent. Amazing Cochinita and lechon. So much flavor and fantastic texture.

It's cool that Merida had kind of a heyday in the mid 1800s. Paseo de Montejo has a lot of beautiful, ornate old buildings that look like they should be an embassy or something. Checked out some of the large markets as well, at people's recommendations here. Had a hard time figuring out where the ""best"" places were. The hawkers were kind of aggressive and I wasn't ready for it. Ending up having some Poc Chuc, which was okay but left me wanting. Walked around some more and had some tepache and ice cream, both of which were fine but nothing special.

Walked around more, swam more to beat the heat and rested at the hotel. Had some fish tacos at El Fabuloso Pez. Nice presentation, though the place seemed pretty corporate/cookie cutter. Got a little bit sick from the food. Went to Golden Island Casino after, which was disappointing, as it was almost entirely video slots. 

Took an Uber back to Centro and went to Pipiripau for a drink and it was totally dead. Then went to La Negrita. Bands were playing, people dancing, super fun scene. Had some ceviche, which was uninspiring, but didn't matter. Negrita was great.


**Tuesday**

Day trip to Uxmal for ruins. Walked around a bunch. Lots of tourists around obviously, but it was cool. Didn't pay for a guide or tour or anything. Just wandered. Saw some lizards get into an intense fight. Left to go to Hacienda Mucuyche for lunch and the cenote. Lunch was fine, nothing special. Had some salbutes, chips, water and other snacks. The cenote was done as part of a tour group. Kind of felt Disney-ified, but was super beautiful. Wish we had longer to swim around. Went to cenote Kankirixche after, which was also pretty, but the opposite experience. Instead of a guided tour and guides and stuff, you just gave the guy $30MX for a little laminated card. Then you give the card to the guy by the cenote and he just lets you do your thing. Very different experiences, both fun.

Got stopped again by federales getting back into Yucatan. They seemed perplexed that I didn't speak Spanish and let me go. Had reservations at Nectar for dinner, but wife got super sick either from lunch or accidentally drinking cenote water or something. Had to cancel the reservation. People at the hotel suggested Uber Eats for delivery, and figured why not. Wanted to see what the burrito was like, and ordered one from La Taque. It came on a paper tray, wrapped in plastic, which was weird, but was very tasty. And huge! No rice either, just meat and cheese wrapped up and grilled a bit.


**Wednesday**

Woke up for a taco brunch. Walked to Taqueria Yucatan. Good tacos! Great tortillas! Nice service even though they didn't speak any English, and my Spanish is very limited. The chaya con huevos was excellent. Checked out of hotel and drove to Wayan'e for more tacos. Loved the variety and amazing flavors. I'd read about green chorizo but never eaten it before. Really delicious. Didn't love that they charged me for 6 tacos and only gave me 5, and that the prices on the receipt didn't match the menu. But the food was great, so I wasn't complaining.

Started the drive out of Merida to El Cuyo for some beach time. Stopped by Federales, because of course. I booked with Mattias through VRBO, emailed back and forth a few times to confirm details, including within a week of our scheduled arrival, and everything seemed like it was going to be setup for a nice stay.

Got into El Cuyo, located the Hacienda, knocked on the door, and another guest let us in. They told me I should message Mattias or his assistant Magally via WhatsApp for the keys. So I messaged Magally and she told me that there were no rooms available. I sent her a photo of my confirmation, but she was not apologetic and offered no alternatives. VRBO had only one other place in El Cuyo, Cabanas El Cuyo. It was super bare bones. Wood plank room, bad lighting, sub par bed & pillows, no A/C, bad water pressure, luke warm shower. If there were neighbors, I would have heard everything the did. But Reyes, the guy running it, was nice enough. And it was right on the beach, so the breeze was great and the view was incredible.

Unfortunately, Reyes also suggested getting dinner at Loncheria La Lupita. Got some tacos, gringas and salbutes. I say unfortunately, because maybe it wasn't the cleanest place, because I got really sick from the food. Had a rough night.


**Thursday**

Didn't sleep much that night. Decided that it would be nicer outside than inside and rolled around on a lounger for a few hours. Had some water. Ventured into town for some pancakes at Naia Cafe. Right on cue, more Federales show up. These ones were very interested in me and my passport. Took one of the other diner's passports and didn't seem to give it back. Pancakes were mediocre. Could have used some baking soda. Hung out more on the beach. Weather was mid 80s and beautiful. Maybe only two other people within sight on the beach. Totally chill.

Originally had an idea to get dinner in Tizimin, but after seeing the roads and lack of lighting, changed plans. Got dinner that night at Chile Gordo. It's run by a nice British woman and very cute. Food is central Mexican/Veracruz in style and good. Walked around El Cuyo some more. Kids were preparing for Carnival the next week. Watched them a bit. Star gazed. Had some night beach. Cooled off at night to upper 70s.


**Friday**

Packed up and left El Cuyo. Drove through Yucatan. Got stopped by Federales once again. This guy kept saying there was something wrong with license plates of the rental van. Wouldn't let us go. He said we had to go to Merida for some kind of inspection and similar nonsense. We said we could not do that. Eventually he asked for a bribe. Being that we had to catch a flight, ended up paying and then leaving. He said be careful.

Filled up the van, took it back to Hertz. Still waiting to see if they charge anything extra for damage that doesn't exist. Flight home was thankfully uneventful other than that the Direct TV/movies didn't work.


So that's about it! Tried to be concise, but got long winded. If you have any questions, I can try to help."
"2i48mc"|"JetBlue Non-refundable ticket policy"|"So last year, I booked a non-refundable flight on my company card for a business trip. A day before the trip, my boss tells me that the trip is cancelled. So I end up having to expense my card, because the flight was non-refundable. The company pays for it and all is square.

Almost a year later (now), I get a random email from our company?s outsourced travel agency, saying that I have not used this ticket and that it will officially expire this December.

My question is now: (1) Will JetBlue allow me to use this credit towards the purchase of another airline ticket to somewhere else? (2) Is it likely that my purchasing a personal ticket will alert anyone from my company? (3) Will JetBlue allow me to buy my ticket with this credit along with a ticket for a friend as well?

Thank you!

"ahtett"|"Cheap Airline Carry on Bag Sizes"|"So I've only ever flown once that I can remember, which was just last month in December from MD to FL and back. Since I was basically a first time flyer I was super meticulous with the bag sizes and liquids. We flew JetBlue Economy and I ended up having to pay for one checked bag. But a couple weeks before we left I went out and got new luggage and mini backpacks to use as myself and my daughters carry on and personal bags. They weren't expensive, but I spent like $60 with the mind set that buying new luggage in the smaller, correct sizes will prevent a SECOND $60 checked bag fee each way.I had a cute, brand new book bag that was going to be my daughter's personal bag, but because the measurements of the bag went just over the stated limit on the website, I didn't take it.

So we get to the airport and meet my sister in law, and she also has one daughter, and they both have these big backpacks and rolling luggage about the same size as our rolling carry ons. I was like, aren't your bags going to be too big to be a personal item?! She was like, No! I hope not. They had just traveled to CA and back so I trusted her, and she was right.

It seemed to me neither airport, BWI or MCO, cared much about the size of the carry on and personal bags, as long as they fit where they were supposed to.

Yesterday, I read about the JetBlue $64 roundtrip sale that was happening between NYC and tons of major cities around the country. Impulsively, I bought two trips. While checking out, I read fine print that said all flights were refundable within 24 hours of purchase, provided the trip was at least seven days out (mine were). I planned to spend last night thinking it over/researching, then decide which flight I wanted to keep and cancel the other today.

However, I just got off the phone with a JB agent who said, ""Fun fact, you actually can't cancel these sales. The fine FINE print says these tickets are nonrefundable/transferable. Shoulda read closer, joke's on you, etc.""

I hate to think there's nothing I can do in this situation, and that I'm just gonna be out $140 (though I'm aware that I'm probably just SOL on this one). Does anyone know of any loopholes to cancel on flash sale promotions similar to this one?

[UPDATE]: Thanks to /u/boobsaredopes advice, I emailed JetBlue telling them it was illegal not to let any passenger cancel any flight within 24 hours of booking...and they were immediately like, ""Oh, no, we're so sorry -- you actually CAN cancel your flight."" So...yeah. Crisis averted."

We all scheduled our flight so that we would arrive back in Boston in time for work. Now we have had to reschedule 3 meetings and burn 2 more hours of vacation time. I spoke with a gate agent and simply asked for some simple food vouchers so that we could get some breakfast while we waited.  She shunned me off with a sly smile telling me she was waiting on a supervisor.  I then went to the Jetblue help desk and finally got a supervisor on my own.  She then told me there was nothing she could do and that I should call the 1-800 number and speak to a customer service rep.  At this point I was more irritated by the lack of respect so I called a customer service rep named Amber who then proceeded to tell me that I would have to file a complaint through their ""speak up"" button on the website and that she could provide no help.  I clicked on the speak up button and went to the compensation section only to find that the button to choose departure dates is a 'javascript(0);' call.  In other words, it does nothing.

As far as I can tell Jetblue's policy is to give us vouchers worth $25 for future travel on their airline.  Given their absolute lack of respect for their own motto, I would prefer to not get compensated with something that just gives them more money.

I was shocked when I was sent login info of my current jetblue username and password. This shows me that my data is not safe with jetblue. If you are hashing passwords like you should you are unable to reverse the password back to plain text. The correct way to store passwords would be to take the users password, add a salt to it (this would be a random sting added to the end of the users pass), hash (this is a no reversible encryption) then store this in your data base. When the user goes to login the server takes the password and adds the salt to it then checks this off the data base. A better way to do this is to assign a random salt to each user in the database. then do the same as above but grab the salt from the database. This needs to be fixed ASAP as its a huge venerability to users security. If you have any questions please contact me.

I have called them about 6 times in the past month and have never spent less than 55 minutes, one call was more than two hours.


I booked a trip to Playa del Carmen to a resort with my boyfriend and bought trip insurance back in the fall from Jan 4 to 11 through Expedia. We broke up (lol) so I called to cancel the trip and was refunded and received airline credits. In order to go myself I had to call and rebook, which I did from Jan 4 to 8. 


Winter storm Grayson appeared on January 4 so I ended up just canceling the whole trip because my flight down to Cancun got canceled. I was told if I called Expedia before 11 am on January 4 to cancel the trip that I would receive a full refund from the hotel, so I called the night of January 3 to cancel the trip again.


This is where things go to shit. I spent two hours on the phone with a rep who supposedly canceled the trip for me. He was befuddled because he was asking me to check my email about getting a cancelation email and I never did. He finally ""manually"" sent one which is just some text and looked kind of sketchy. He also asked me to check my Expedia.com profile to make sure the trip said canceled. It never did but he didn't seem concerned. I never got another email about the cancelation and I kept checking my Expedia.com profile and the trip still said in progress. How odd, I thought...


Today, I kept getting emails from JetBlue about checking in for my flight. Checked my profile again and trip still said in progress. I called customer service again to make sure the trip was properly canceled. The woman I was on the phone with was getting increasingly annoyed at me because I kept saying please, can you resend the email about the flight credit, can you please resend the email about the trip cancelation, why does it say still in progress on my profile, etc. I'm glad I kept harping on her.


After 20 minutes of her saying ""I promise it is canceled!"" she realized that she was looking at the wrong trip. 


THEY HAD NEVER CANCELED THE SECOND TRIP AFTER I SPOKE WITH 4 CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. I'm now out $900 and a $200 flight credit. I'm a grad student. I don't have this kind of money to be throwing around on a trip I never went on. I'm about to have a panic attack because I'm still on hold to speak to her manager (and have been on hold for half an hour) and I don't think I""m going to get refunded.



I would HIGHLY recommend not using Expedia if there is any tiny chance at all that something is going to happen to your trip and you are going to have to contact customer service. I would never, ever want someone else to have to go through this ridiculous situation and I think it's truly not worth it. Next time I travel, I'd rather pay more to book through a better service or even the resort itself. 




EDIT: I GOT A FULL REFUND. I still think their customer service is atrocious and I had to spend an additional four hours on the phone but I did it. I just kept asking to speak to managers until I made it up to corporate, explained the situation, and had them pull the recording of the call. Was supposed to hear from them about it after 72 hours, didn't, called back and bitched my way up to corporate again. Once they listened to it they realized that I was right and their agent had screwed up!! Either that or they were sick of me calling. The people in corporate were way better to talk to though. All of them definitely had English as a first language so there was no chance of misunderstanding and they actually sounded like they genuinely felt bad about how dumb the situation was.

"68g14v"|"Items stolen from checked luggage which was searched by TSA."|"I left St. Lucia yesterday afternoon with four bottles of rum packed in one of my bags. When I arrived home late last night I found only two bottles of rum in the bag and a notification from the TSA that my bag had been searched. We had to change plans at JFK on our way back to Boston, which is where the search must have taken place.

I have contacted JetBlue to alert them to the issue and ask for their assistance. I will also be filing a complaint with the TSA per the instructions on their website. Does anyone else who has had a similar experience have any further suggestions of action I could take?

I am beyond frustrated at this. I visited the island last year and brought home one bottle of a particular rum I liked. After finishing that bottle off I wished I had bought more. This time down I bought two bottles of that same rum and found two other types I liked of which I bought one bottle each. They are all St. Lucian rums and are not available anywhere near NH. One of the rums stolen was only available at the distillery which I visited during the vacation.

It's not the money involved as it's only about $80 worth of rum, but the fact that these were my souvenirs which I intended to enjoy for months to come as a reminder of my trip to the island were stolen from me in such a blatant manner. I entrusted my bags to JetBlue and the TSA only to have this happen. Now I'm just getting ready for each to say the other could have been at fault and both deny any responsibility. Even if the TSA does admit fault, I don't want the money...I want the damn rum I purchased!

I couldn't take these items in my carry-on luggage like I do with all other valuable items since that amount of liquids cannot go through security.

I can't get over that they would search my bag, take two bottles of rum and then leave the notice indicating the bag was searched. It's essentially leaving a business card at the scene of the a crime you just committed.

Maybe I should just be happy they didn't take all of the rum and were nice enough to leave me two of the bottles.

So if anyone who has had a similar experience and has advice to lend (beyond contacting JetBlue and filing a complaint with the TSA) it would be very appreciated.

"5f0faf"|"When will I have to get my checked bags between countries?"|"So I'll break down my entire flight to you because I'm unsure if I'll have to get my checked bags. **Airlines A & B** are different airlines. 

**Airline A:** 

1.  Depart Frankfurt, Germany on Nov 28th
2.  Arrive in Dublin, Ireland with a 2 hour layover 
3. Depart Dublin, Ireland
4. Arrive in New York, New York with a 1hr30min layover (final destination under **Airline A**)

**Airline B:** 

 1. Depart New York, New York after the 1.5hr layover
 2. Arrive in Phoenix, Arizona as my ultimate destination on Nov 28th 

So the question I have is will I have to get my checked baggages when I arrive in New York since that marks a different airline? If I do have to get my checked baggages, then afterwards do I just go to the **Airline B** desk and print out my other boarding pass and then have to go to security again? OR will I be able to just go ahead and print my boarding pass in NY under **Airline B** and head on to my next flight to Arizona and my baggages should be transferred to my next flight? 

Im concerned because I don't want to leave my bags in NY when I get to Arizona. Also, don't I have to go through customs in New York? I'm worried with a 1.5 hour layover that I won't have time to print my boarding pass, go through security again, and also go through customs. (Sorry for the long post. I just want to be as detailed as possible so I can be prepared for what's next.

I need to fly my aunt out here since my grandmother passed recently. I've never bought a ticket before online and don't know how to go about it since she isn't buying it herself.

When I find a suitable site and flight, Do I just purchase it and email her the information? Would she be able to get in that way? If she doesn't have access to a printer, can she use the information on her phone to get through?


Most flights I see have one layover. What is a suitable time to have for a layover so she can get her stuff and not miss the next flight?

How big are these seats? She is kind of a big lady and I don't want her to be super uncomfortable.

Does she get one bag for free or is she to pay for each and every bag?

What about medications? Can she place them in her bag and they pass through okay?

How early would she need to get there? (Tampa, FL) How fast/slow can the lines be? I haven't been on a plane since I was 7.

I'm just generally nervous about all of this. I don't want to mess this process up since the flight is so expensive. Thanks for any and all information.

I'm heading to Chile in a few months after finding a killer deal on flights to visit a friend on study abroad and to explore the country! It's my first *international* trip alone, and I've been doing a lot of research (because that's honestly part of the fun). Here's the itinerary I've come up with for now, leaving on August 24 and returning on September 4.

* August 25- CHS-FLL; JetBlue, arriving around 3PM. Travel to Miami airport on TriRail, check in around 6PM for an 8:30PM flight on LATAM to Santiago.
* August 26- Arrive in Santiago around 6AM. Meet up with my friend, check into hostel, explore the city (I've got a list of museums/neighborhoods/parks/etc that I want to see, but I'm open to suggestions!).
* August 27- Santiago.
* August 28- Santiago. Grab a late afternoon flight or overnight bus to La Serena.
* August 29- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory).
* August 30- La Serena (visit the Elqui Valley, Parque Nacional Fray Jorge, an observatory). Overnight bus to Santiago.
* August 31- Arrive in Santiago early in the morning, grab a bus to Valpariso.
* September 1- Valpariso.
* September 2- Morning bus to Santiago.
* September 3- Santiago.
* September 4- Santiago, 2:30PM LATAM flight SCL-ASU-GRU-MIA (somehow, it was significantly cheaper this way).
* September 5- Arrive in Miami around 6:30AM. Need to be at FLL for a 6:30 JetBlue flight back to Charleston. Might be meeting a friend for part of the day, but I'm also interested in suggestions for a few hours in Miami.

I'm a 19 y/o guy, and outside of the flights (around $600, already paid), I'm budgeting around $600 for all else. I can increase that, but I'd really prefer not to.

I need to be in Santiago on both weekends so I can meet up with my friend and I'm dead set on seeing Valpariso, but I'm not sure if La Serena is worth the trip. I'm guessing heading south will be too cold in late August/early September, and I visited Death Valley in March and it seems pretty similar to the Atacama. What would you do if you were me, especially regarding the time I'm currently thinking about spending in La Serena?"
"6yum72"|"PSA about Southwest's International Service in Emergencies"|"As someone who flies a lot for work and typically flies Southwest, I was really excited to see them add international offerings and recently flew to Punta Cana for a short vacation. The first day we landed, Irma started to form so I contacted Southwest twice about moving my flight up so we could leave in advance of it getting near the Dominican Republic. We ended up booking a second earlier flight that would get us out of the country in advance of Irma reaching the DR.

Southwest ended up cancelling all service in and out of Punta Cana in the days leading up to Irma (I understand the safety argument, but the weather was fine there until the day of the hurricane and every other carrier flew in and out of the airport with the exception of  Thursday).

I called and was told there was nothing they could do as they only have one flight a day and they would be unable to put us on any other airline as they do not have agreements with them. We were told to ride out the hurricane and that they could get us on a flight in the days after it had passed.

Thankfully we were able to book on a separate airline, but Southwest has been totally unwilling to take any responsibility for the few hundred people they stranded there in the days leading up to the hurricane.  

It has been really frustrating especially after seeing some of the stories about Delta and Jetblue supporting their customers and I just wanted to make sure people were aware of the risks prior to booking with them (especially internationally).

TLDR: Southwest does not have the quantity of planes, infrastructure, or partner airlines to get you out of these international locations in the event of emergencies. Tread carefully before booking any of these flights since they have continually hid behind contract of carriage and refused to refund any of the expenses we had to fly out on a different airline.

Details:
Flying MCO to LAX 5/21; landing 9:33PM (Jetblue); 3.32 layover

LAX to PVG 1:05am-6am (China Eastern); 4.05 layover

PVG to OkA 10:05am-1:30pm (China Eastern)

OKA to PVG, arrival 3:55pm (CE); 5.05 layover

PVG to LAX 9pm-6pm (CE); 3.57 layover

LAX-MCO 9:57pm departure

Ok, a few questions.
1.  Will those layover times be enough for whatever she has to do at each stop?  

2.  She knows she has to collect her bag in LAX both ways, and recheck it.  Does she have to collect her bag in PVG either way or does it get checked all the way through because it's on the same airline?

3.  What does she do when she arrives at PVG?  Does she go through customs and immigration, even if she is never leaving the airport, and just going from one plane to another?  How does that work?

4.  Are there signs in English at PVG?  

Thanks so much for the help. I'm not sure what else I can ask to help her out, so if you have anything else you can share, please feel free to do so!

We know our flight is an Airbus 319 plane. I have also reviewed AA's site to try to figure out how the entertainment system on this plane works. I can tell that we can watch movies and shows for a price, but cannot tell if we can watch live TV and which channels would be available.

- Does anybody here know if live TV is available on these planes or flight? Exact flight is AA 1148, service from DFW to YEG.
- If there is, does it cut out once you cross over to Canada?
- Alternatively, is there decent wifi on this flight? Does that stay on beyond US borders?

I just saw that there is now a link to the beginners guide to airports, and I will be checking that soon. (It wasn't a link when I checked it a few weeks ago.)

Are there any airlines I should avoid?  
I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?

Basically just wondering if I should buy now or wait till November."|"Hi guys, sorry if this question is asked fairly frequently, I'm just trying to cover all my bases before making the jump and figured I could use some more experienced advice.

---

My friends and I are trying to plan a trip to California for our last spring break (last semester of college, eek!), but it's difficult mainly because I am the sole person actually moving things forward in the planning sense. I want to give us all a deadline to buy by but I want to also make sure we get the most affordable deal. 

We will be traveling Thursday, March 5th, getting into LA that afternoon, then probably just taking the day to relax/eat and meet up with our friend, and then we're thinking early Friday morning we will all mini-road trip up to Tahoe where a bunch of our other friends live. Just wanted to do something new and spontaneous and see as much of California as we could rather than just limit ourselves to LA (not that it isn't great!). Anyway, then on Monday we'd be coming back to LA and staying until Thursday the 13th. 

----

While we're trying to budget, we know it'll be fairly expensive. I just want to make sure we buy at a good time. I asked my sister and she said she thinks we should wait until November because you get better deals on flights - is this true, to anyone's knowledge? I'm debating between buying now or waiting until November - and if we do wait until November, what week? I essentially am just looking for a good deadline that will give us the closest-to-best-deal possible. 

Thank you!"
"40zzq2"|"What happens when you book a flight from a travel website and one of the flights gets cancelled or delayed?"|"
Jetblue has routes to Saint Petersburg through Aeroflot. However, when I search on Aeroflot's website, it won't let me pick Buffalo as a starting point. The jetblue's website shows flights for 2K+, which is ridiculous.

When I search on Momondo, I see a Buffalo to Saint Petersburg (the usual stops in between) via Jetblue + Aeroflot. The pricetag on this is only $450.

I booked through one of the websites on momondo before on a similar route and I had to pay baggage fees for Jet blue and then pick up my bags at ewr and then pay again. I very much want to avoid this, as well as my Jetblue flight getting delayed and then missing my flight out of the U.S."

Am I missing anything obvious - by taking 2 one way trips?

I'm looking to fly from Hartford to Orlando and come back 5 days later (16th to 21st). 

Ingoing Jetblue has the perfect time for me (and nonstop) but going back isn't the best on the return. Delta had better times on the return.

Using Google flights - it seems like I can get each for seperate for the same price as round trip using just 1 (400 using Jetblue or delta, or 200 there using Jetblue 200 back using Delta).

Is there totally acceptable practice? Is there anything I'm missing? Since it's the same price I was hoping it wouldn't be dumb to do that since it would be best catering to better times for flights.

(I'm going for only 5 days so I was planning on only bringing a carry on - no checked bags if that helps)."

"2s8ges"|"Expedia's ""Best Price Guarantee"" is a sham"|"I recently booked a vacation package (about 3 weeks in advance) on Expedia. I simultaneously searched other websites for the same package. I saw that JetBlue had the same exact package (same flights, same hotel, same hotel room, same dates) for about $80 cheaper. Having used Expedia many times in the past for flights, and being aware of their [best price guarantee](http://www.expedia.com/p/info-other/guarantees.htm), which promises to credit or refund the difference in price and provide a $50 coupon for a future booking, I figured I would go ahead and book with Expedia. I was a loyal customer, could get some rewards points, and essentially pay ~$130 less.
 
 
 
After booking, I refreshed JetBlue and saw the same package was still available, again for about $80 cheaper. I immediately submit the online application for their Best Price Guarantee, and attach the screenshots as requested. 36 hours later, I receive a confirmation that my application was received. Almost 2 full days after I submitted my application, I received a response that I was denied.
 
 
 
> Your Best Price Guarantee request does not meet the criteria established in the terms and condition:

> - ""The lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives.""

> We checked ""www.jetblue.com"" and found that Universal's Loews Portofino Bay Hotel has no rooms available for your travel dates. Due to this,  we are unable to process your price match request.

 A few issues. 

* They essentially checked 48 hours for an identical package with a cheaper price. Naturally, with the time that elapsed, packages will either sell out or go up in price.

* The claim that the hotel had no rooms available was false. I went back to JetBlue and ran 2 searches. If I searched for just the hotel, then there are no availabilities. If I searched for the package (flight + hotel), then the hotel is available.

* What also hurt my case was that their email is in a different time zone (or something). I contacted them ~1/04/15 2:52 AM, but their email confirming receipt of my application shows that I submitted it on Jan 5, 2015 11:54:50 AM. They could not understand this discrepancy when I brought it up.
 
 
 
I called the number they provided. I explained what I typed just above. They basically kept saying there was nothing they could do since it was determined that my claim was denied.
 
 
 
I emailed again, with additional screenshots depicting that rooms were still available. By this time, rooms with the view that I booked were sold out, but other rooms were still available. And, naturally, flight prices continued to rise. So, while I was not able to reproduce the package several days later, I will still able to address the 2 reasons they gave for declining my claim:

* package was available for a lower rate at the time of contact (evidenced by screenshot)

* rooms were available
 
 
 
Many emails later with attempts to use logic, they still declined my claim. I provided a PDF printout of the *initial* cheaper package as further proof (PDF was not an accepted format on the online application). I admitted I could not provide the same package at a lower price during each email exchange, but that is simply because prices rise with time, and rooms/tickets sell out. I asked what the point of a screenshot is if they will disregard it, and they basically cited the same reasons, but added:
 
 
> We do empathize with your situation and wish we were in a position to do more, however, we need to comply with the rules and restrictions of your reservation.
 
 
 
I called one last time today, asking about the cancellation policy since I had purchased insurance, and when I requested at least a travel voucher, the agent was able to give me a $50 one.
 
 
 
**TL;DR** - booked with expedia based on ""Best Price Guarantee"". I met all requirements and provided proof. They checked ~48 hours later, after prices rose and rooms sold out, and deemed that they could not determine the lower-priced package was available at a lower rate when I first contacted them. "

"2rtli1"|"Better to pay cheapest fare for a flight, or pay more to accumulate miles with your ""preferred"" carrier?"|"So I'm planning a trip in the next month or two, and usually I fly United/Star Alliance. That's where the majority of my miles are since I did a couple international flights. I'd like to continue accumulating miles for use at a later time, but I'm wondering, is it worth paying more for a flight to add to miles or is it better to just pay for the cheaper flight? And if so, at what points does the cost vs. miles savings not become realistic?

My flight will be from NYC to Portland, or possibly to Chicago (or both through the year) and it looks like the cheapest flights (or the ones with the fewest connections) are JetBlue and Delta (I think) but I might be able to pick up a United (where my miles are) flight for $50 more, or even $100 more, but will likely also extend my travel time and have a connection.

At what point is it not worth it? Is there a formula? Rule of thumb?

I don't plan on spending miles for these trips right now, btw.

Literally hours of negotiation and MANY escalations to the next higher up manager led to us getting a room like we reserved, but we had to switch rooms during the visit.  Atlantis thought it was ok to ask me to check out of one room by 11, take my bags to the bell desk, have no room until 3 or 4 and check in again.  I raised a stink and we got to stay in the one room until the other was ready.  Stupid.  Lots of other really poor service with no apologies or empathy.  Then they tried to charge us again for the rooms we already paid for.  I spent more time at the front desk than in the water.

I should have read the fine print, because the confirmation e-mail says I need any one of a number of special international youth/student ID's (in addition to the normal state/federal ID to get through security) or the airline can deny me entry. I have my school ID, but no international ID of the type they're asking for. 

So should I be scrambling to get a new ID from one of these international agencies? I have a feeling my e-ticket would be identical to others and the gate attendant wouldn't have any idea I was on a student ticket. Plus it seems like student status should have been verified when I bought, not when I boarded. Anyone know from experience whether or not I actually need international student ID?"

"f4gyd"|"Help figuring out someplace warm to go for a few days!"|"There are some awesome two-day deals on JetBlue right now and I want to take advantage of them. The options I was thinking mostly about are a stay in..
-Kingston, Jamaica
-Ponce, PR
-Nassau, BS
-Barbados
-St. Lucia
in the early part of February.

About me: I'm not a huge traveler and generally not very active when I vacation - a nice beach to chill out on and some good food is all I need. I don't have a lot of money so not looking to really live it up, just get somewhere warm with my gf for a few days. Definitely hoping for a cheap but safe hotel. I appreciate live music and theatre and of course good food. 

Let me know what you think! Thanks guys!

"fm2tc"|"Cheapest time to buy flight to CA for the summer?"|"I'll be taking a trip this summer out to California, flying out of Boston.  My dates are fairly inflexible, and I'd pay more to fly direct on Jetblue or Virgin.  

My question is why is it so expensive if it's still months away?  right now, JetBlue shows a fare of $515 for my itinerary (BOS->SFO, SAN->BOS) on my dates.  I've gotten fares to LAX with 5 days advance purchase for under $400 before.

When is the best time to buy?  Is it likely that either airline will run a sale anytime soon, or should I just bit the bullet and pay the $515 before it goes up anymore?"
