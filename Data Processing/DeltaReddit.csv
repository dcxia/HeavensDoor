When I landed in JFK I had a connection on Delta and I was in seat 11A comfort plus. I was booked economy for both flights but on Delta it seems I got upgraded.

I drove her to the airport and dropped her off on time for her flight. The second delay caused her to not be able to make her connection. 
The supervisor told her it was their fault and due to crew issues, but that they couldn't do anything because it was late in the day. The supervisor said that she may be able to get a hotel voucher at the airport of her connection, but arrangements could not be made ahead of time.
My mom didn't like the idea of flying and not having definitive plans for the night. I picked her up and will be driving her to the airport again tomorrow morning before work starts for me. My mother will also have to take another personal day. Given that this delay was due to crew issues and not weather or something beyond Delta's control can my mother get reimbursed in any way?"

According to [https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html](https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html)

""Passengers will be able to hold a reservation without payment, or cancel a booking without penalty, for 24 hours after the reservation is made, if they make the reservation one week or more prior to a flight?s departure date.""

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

So I disputed the $200 fee with my bank, and just now I've realized that I lost the dispute.

As for the 3rd party, if it was a 3rd party who booked this, it was an @travelersdesks.com email address who sent me confirmation. Does anyone know what company this is? I was in contact with them through Delta's direct customer service line +18002211212 from an agent claiming to be a supervisor."

I wanted to gather as much info as I can to help my case before I call them and see what they can do.

Is there a website where I can see what flights are flying on what days, regardless of ticket availability? (Somewhat like how I can look on Google and see what exact time a flight landed a week ago). the reason I ask this is because I'm not sure if that originally planned direct flight is still planning on flying that route or not.

Even if, in the terms and conditions, they can do anything they want with my flight (which seems ridiculous by the way - for example what if someone paid for Non-Stop and then they got changed months ahead to a 2 stopper even though they paid the much higher rate for the nonstop flight), what ground can I stand on to try to have them compensate for this..? 

I might try to have them put me on a flight 1 day earlier that is direct..

Is it possible for them to put me on a direct the same day with another airline? (Genuinely asking, if it's a stupid question, please be kind)..

And then what sort of compensation would be reasonable given this hassle? We have planned this trip out and then we're given this change, the departure time is also quite different than what we had planned on with our original flight.

Basically my Fiance an I were 2 hours early to our flight, we were checked in and everything was good, itinerary, boarding pass, tickets etc all for the 9th of August. When it came time to board our tickets flashed red with an error about ""lack of flight crew"" or something, but the gate agent saw we had the right boarding passes and let us on.

Once on the plane a lady ended up getting the same seat number as me (she was someone who was changed over to this flight to Seattle because she had missed hers the day before). After about 10 minutes, the gate crew turned up and told my fiance an I that we had to leave the plane. We showed them our boarding pass, and tickets etc, and they just said ""you need to get off"".

We had no idea at this point what the hell was going on. When we got back to the gate they told us ""You booked your tickets for tomorrow, not today"". Red flags instantly went up, we were like ""hold on no we didn't?"" they wouldn't help us there, they told us we had to go back to the booking counter and sort it out there, so we did. Once there they told us the same thing ""you booked for tomorrow"". The lady who actually sent us through 2 hours earlier appeared and questioned why we were there, we told her and she said ""It said the 9th, their itinerary and everything is for the 9th"" that's when they went ""oops, it's just a glitch...you were meant to be on that flight"". I should point out that the flight had more than 10 seats left, so it was in no way full.

After 3 hours of piss arsing on their end, and explaining that I HAD to get back to Australia for an important VISA interview, they finally got us onto some flights. This is where it got even more stupid. They were unable to check our baggage in, and tried to tell us that we couldn't get on the flight because their system wouldn't let us check our baggage...until finally one of the guys was like ""We do have manual tickets you know"". So they got us manual tickets through the gate, and our luggage was put on there. Please note we had to fly to Seattle using Atlantic, because Delta had already left with no other flights for the day to Seattle.

Our next stop over from Seattle was to LAX, we arrived with 30 minutes to spare before we had to get on, and were assured our luggage was safely going to LAX.

So once we arrived in LAX, we had at least a bit of leeway with time, a good 1 hour and a half! To get to our gate. So we made it there, and turns out they gave our seats away! SHOCK! Well Delta did, at this point we were going to be flying through with Virgin, but it seems Delta didn't reiterate them our seats....eventually they sorted that out and we managed to get on the plane. We waited 2 hours....the plane wasn't leaving. Why? Apparently 22 passengers were missing from the plane, so they had to take their luggage off. Which was weird, because it sure as hell didn't look like 22 passengers were missing from the bloody plane.

Anyway after 14 hours we arrived back in Brisbane, and...no luggage. Nothing. In fact, it wasn't just my fiance an I, it was about 22 of us or so that lost our luggage. Turns out Delta's system didn't really relay to them correctly on luggage.

Anyway it took them 4 days to get our luggage back to us, now we've run into the issues in trying to get compensation.

Virgin Australia doesn't seem to have the option to make a claim for delayed luggage, in fact the details on my page are not up to date properly and seem to be reading wrong, not to mention they managed to screw up my email. On top of that we can't make a claim through Delta because we don't have a number for Delta's site that works.

So what I want to know is...what can we do? We had to spend about $200AUD just to get clothes and toiletries for the 4 days we had NOTHING. Do I call them? Or am I fresh out of luck?



Also they offered us absolutely NO compensation when they involuntarily removed us from the flight in the first place, nothing at all. They told us that we needed to come the next day....to flights that didn't even exist on their website or on their own database!"

I can't find any details on Delta, aside from referring back to TSA. Obviously my concern is someone arbitrarily saying No... which I guess could happen at any time.

Does anyone have experience/knowledge with Delta specifically?"

"1429066016.0"|"My cellphone has been stuck in the guts of a Delta Airlines jet for a month"|"So a month ago my cellphone fell out of my pocket on takeoff and down into the inner workings of Delta Airlines Jet.  They said they would mail it back to me when they were able to dig it out but it's been a month and other than the ""we received your complaint"" auto-response email I have heard nothing from Delta.  I am open to suggestions on how to resolve this properly.

This is the message I sent to Delta Airlines:  

To Whom It May Concern At Delta,

During takeoff on DELTA 2379 on the morning of 3/16/2015 my cellphone slid out of my coat pocket and fell through a gap in the floor that should have never been there in the first place. 

There are these plastic panels that are supposed to be attached where the floor of the cabin and the curve of the plane fuselage meet.  I noticed that in my window seat ( 39F or 41F, I can't recall exactly, only that it was a window seat) that the panel to the right of the window seat directly in front of me was completely detached and being propped up by the bracket the seat is mounted to.  You could easily see a couple feet down into the plane through the hole.  The panel next to my seat was still basically attached but was shoved in at the bottom leaving about a two inch gap.  A gap, as it turns out, that is big enough for cellphone to fall through.

I had initially assumed my phone was just on the floor somewhere after I dropped it and that I would probably have to  wait until we landed at Minneapolis-Saint Paul to look for it, given the confines of the seating arrangement.  It was only when I was unable to find my phone anywhere where it would be reasonable expected to be found given the layout that I noticed the missing and shoved-in panels.  I theorized that it had probably fallen through one of the shoved-in/defective panel gap(s) and I voiced my concerns as such.  The flight crew were all standing around discussing what could be done, even the captain had come back to see what all the fuss was about.  I was told they were going to get an engineer to look for it while the plane was being prepared for it's next and within the hour take off.  

After about 20 minutes I asked a Delta associate behind the desk if she knew anything about the lost phone, and was told, after she went back down the ramp to ask, that they had indeed found my phone and that it had indeed fallen through the gap in the shoved-in panel and into the ""guts"" of the plane.  After not being able to reach it with the tools they had I was informed that they, understandably, aren't going to hold up a plane to fish out someone's cellphone, and that they would mail my phone back to me when they have more time to get it out.  They took down my address and info and I left to catch my connecting flight to Washington-Reagan.

I've just spent the last week driving my afraid-to-fly daughter and her two cats from Washington, DC to Medford, OR.  a 3,000+ mile trip where a cellphone full of important family contact info and working GPS is all but essential.  I went ahead and purchased a cheap cellphone and a prepaid SIM card, there was really no choice in the matter.  The phone is unfortunately horribly inferior to the Samsung Galaxy 5s of mine that is (probably), still ""flying the friendly skies"" for free wedged deep down inside the plane.  

I still have not received said phone back nor heard a word from Delta about it and can only surmise that they didn't bother or were unable to actually retrieve the aforementioned glass and metal electronic device from inside the body of the plane.

So it comes down to this: were it not for the sorry and disturbingly-poor state of the floor panels my phone would have never gotten lost in the innards of this plane.  Had the cabin been properly maintained this would have never been the huge problem it has turned into.  It is not unreasonable to expect a plane to be maintained at least to the level were it is somewhat difficult for electronic devices to fall into it's inner workings.  If my phone is not returned within the next couple weeks I expect Delta to either replace it with the exact same model or compensate me for its worth.  This is generously-reasonable request given the circumstances.

I eagerly await your reply.

Regards,

"1454043520.0"|"UPDATE - Virgin Atlantic Refused to Board Me and Delta Delayed My Bag"|"**UPDATE**

I have an update regarding my situation as [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/)

After advice from the comments, I haven't contacted Virgin Atlantic yet knowing that I have a weaker case against them.

However, Delta's claim officer called me couple days ago and said that since my flight plan was cancelled by Virgin Atlantic, it's not Delta's fault that they delayed my bags for over a week, so they won't reimburse me anything.

Here's the story about the lost baggage. Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. The whole experience has been super expensive and frustrating for me.

**December 14th, 7 AM** - I flew from PHL to JFK in Delta. 

**8 AM** - I landed in JFK. I was at the Virgin Atlantic's boarding gate for about 45 minutes trying to figure out my travel situation. The VA agents at the boarding gate told me that my bag has been pulled out of the plane and I can collect it from Delta's baggage claim.

**8:45 AM** - When I went downstairs to the baggage claim, I couldn't find my bag. I spoke to Delta agents and they said that *""yes, your bag was pulled out of the plane, but one of our staff made a mistake and put it back on the queue. But your bag is still in the JFK airport. We will have baggage handling guys pull it out from the queue and bring it back here. You can come back after 30-40 minutes to pick it up.""*

**9:00 - 9:30 AM** - I used those 30 minutes to step out to the lounge area and figure out the rest of the trip. I finally booked my tickets with United and made travel arrangements to go to EWR from JFK (neither VA nor Delta helped me here, off course).

**9:30 - 4 PM** - When I came back after 30 minutes, I found my bag was still missing. I checked again - and they said, they are having someone bring my bag to me and asked me to just wait. Now, this is almost 10 AM. I spent next 6+ hours at the airport in the baggage claim area trying to figure out where my bag was. Delta kept changing their story from *""Wait for few minutes""* to *""It's Virgin Atlantic's fault, talk to them""* (spoke to Virgin Atlantic staff but she didn't even bother to look into their system to find my bag), to finally Delta acknowledging, *""Sorry, we can't find your bag, but we know it's in JFK""*. Delta's baggage claim supervisor tried to find my bag in the system. He said the last time my bag was in Delta's system was at 10:30 AM in one of the racks but when he called a staff in the racks area to retrieve my bag, it was not there. And they don't know where my bag is.

**4 PM** - My flight to United was at 8 PM, but I still needed to take a bus to EWR, do security check up again and figure out if they were also going to refuse to board me. Delta's baggage supervisor said *""sorry we messed up""* many times. They acknowledged that it was their own staff who mistakenly put my bag in the queue AFTER it was pulled out from the VA plane. The supervisor asked me to fill out the claim information. I wrote down my Indian (Delhi) address and Indian phone number, and the supervisor said ""we will deliver your bag to your doorstep in Delhi in a couple days"". I got a tracking number and the supervisor told me to track my bag on www.delta.com/trackbag

**4:30 PM** - I leave for EWR. No issues while boarding there.

**December 15th 10 PM (Indian Time)** - I land in Delhi.  I check delta.com/trackbag. I see that the bag is on a KLM flight (Delta's partner) and is in Amsterdam. And it is scheduled to arrive in Delhi on December 16th. 

**December 16th** - I check delta.com/trackbag - no update in status. I spend entire day at my address to make sure I don't miss the delivery. I called Delta, gave them my tracking ID and my baggage tag number - they couldn't find any information about my bag. Asked me to call back next day when they have more information. Delta's 999 Baggage Assistance emailed me saying the same - they have no information but they are trying to find it. I have that email as a record.

**December 17th** - I check the website - still no updates. I called Delta again, they acknowledge that the bag was enroute to DEL through Amsterdam, but they have no current information. Asked me to give them one more day. Email asked for more details, but didn't provide any idea about what happened to my bag. 

**December 18th (Friday)** - I check the website - still no updates. I call Delta - they had no new information for me. They don't know where my bag is. At 4 PM (1 hour before the airline luggage counters close), I simply drove to the DEL airport. Walked up to the KLM luggage counter at the airport. Found my bag sitting there among a pile of other lost and found bags. The staff there asked me to sign my name before allowing me to take the bag home with me. 

**December 19th (Saturday India Time/Friday EST)** - Received an email from Delta - they still have no clue where my bag is. I told them that I found my bag.

**Fast Forward - last week** - Delta sent an email saying that they were sorry for the delay in my bag and that I would be eligible for any purchases I made during this time. Asked me to send them receipts, which I did.

**Couple days ago** - The Delta claim agent called, asked me to tell her why I got out at JFK. I just mentioned *""I didn't have the right documents for Virgin Atlantic, so needed a different flight""*. And before I could even further explain the rest of the story, she just cut me off and said *""sorry, that's not a Delta problem. We are not liable for delay in your bag if you change plans. You are not eligible for any claim. Bye.""*

So there's where I am right now. I paid a huge price for my one mistake of not checking the transit visa requirements. But tell me, what's the Delta's price for being just incompetent? "

"1546759211.0"|"Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying?"|"Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying:

1. Always check allowed sizes before a flight (they can change). Slightly oversized bags may make it on most flights, but eventually someone at a random gate will tell you it can't go onboard, that it will have to go as checked baggage, and possibly charge you for it (sometimes between transfers).

2. Certain items damaged in checked baggage are not covered under airline policies. You should ALWAYS declare said items if stopped at the gate and either repack to protect it or attempt to work out another arrangement. Never assume personnel saying ""Don't worry, we'll take good care of it"" is enough to place liability on the airline.

3. Despite nobody doing this, ever, READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE you are agreeing to before a flight. Usually when buying a ticket or at the time of check-in is when you agree to abide by said terms.

4. DOT only oversees guidelines for bag damage, not airline excluded items. Items not covered policies are acknowledged as an agreement between airlines and the passengers by terms of service / policies.

5. You may go through the hassle of having to physically file your claim at the airport within 24hrs or less of arrival, fill out a lengthy claim form with proof of purchase and photo evidence, possibly receive a cookie cutter response from corporate that your claim was denied (without providing a channel to explain the scenario that occurred), and realize you may have a low chance of winning a legal battle / wasted most of your time because your bag was just slightly more oversized than the allowed carry-on size you agreed to at the time of ticket purchase or check-in.

6. None of that may even matter because they allow for oversized carry-ons to begin with (or purposely choose to reduce overhead cabin size to increase checked bag sales) reducing available space, leading to (if you're unlucky enough) having your within limits carry-on bag go as checked baggage anyways. But hey, maybe you'll have more legal grounds to protect your items if you still follow reason 2 listed above.

7. Maybe you shouldn't fly anyways because the seats keep getting more cramped, less comfortable, you might get unlucky enough to be placed behind a higher class that can recline their seat into your face, and you could experience the consistent marketing taunt some airlines love to torture you with of how much better your experience could be if you paid them the big bucks (talking about you, Delta).

Side Note: Home insurance doesn't cover travel damage. Always keep receipts for all purchases. Read your product warranties, they usually do not cover physical damage or purchases by 3rd party vendors (which do exist on sites like Amazon).


My questions are:

1. Do you think enough social pressure would ever cause airlines to change their policies to benefit society as a whole versus pursuing lengthy and costly legal battles?

2. Are you going to read all of this or post a comment that says, ""do you seriously expect me to read all of this?"" before realizing I just called you out and delete your post but then possibly re-comment since I called you out again, but ultimately leave it up to chance because I'll end it with saying there's a probably you will either comment or not and suggest you should comment about people needing to read the fine print or terms of service. Or if you didn't realize I did all of this, we should all reply something stupid that seems like it should make sense related to the comment you posted.

3. Will this be reported at first glance for having my questions down at the bottom while riding the grey area of having an airline question along with a warning? If it does get take down, can I assume that this is a fact of life that life's a gamble and I probably will never receive an answer to stated question anyways?

4. Should we be more concerned as citizens that airlines are becoming too consolidated and are [extracted because idk if this language is allowed on this sub-reddit] us over with money grabbing policies, or accept it as a necessary evil to chance having unrestrictive opportunity (from a law perspective, unless lawmakers have money riding on that airline) to fuel the advancement of technology such as tablets on the back of seats? What solutions do you propose would lead to favorable outcomes for us citizens (or specific class level)?

5. Why Delta, why?

On the page it does the calculation for you, informing me that after the cancellation fee I would be left with a $170 refund. I wasn't in love with it, but I didn't really have a choice. I clicked cancel.
Next day I check my email, and see that the $170 is not paid in cash, but in VA flight credit. What? For the $150 cancellation fee they couldn't even do me the courtesy of giving me the rest of my overpriced ticket price refunded in cash. That important detail was hidden in a morass of microscopic font on a different page. 

So I'm stuck holding $170 in flight credit. This is a problem, because where am I going to fly to? They have like six locations, and two are in Hawaii. To recap, VA gets $150 free and clear, they have seven weeks to fill that seat, and I the consumer am left with $170 of flight credit for an airline that has direct flights to a handful of locations, and if you don't happen to need to go directly to/from those places they charge a truly exorbitant amount for connections (hence my heinously overpriced $330 domestic one-way from JFK to Denver).

So that means I have to basically force a flight somewhere as a grad student to some place I don't need to go in the next 18 months, because that's the other catch -- in the email you get about your new ""Elevate"" flight credit, they cheerfully inform you that your points never expire... as long as you make some kind of transaction every 18 months. Well unless you're a business flyer, it's gonna be pretty tough to use those points every 18 months. I sure am not going to be able to find a way to force a flight to some random location in the next 18 months as a grad student with only $170 credit.

And this really sums up the entire VA experience. Throughout my hours-long conversations with customer service, I was reminded again and again that this was the policy, and I should have read it. Yes, I should have. Clearly. But time and again, whenever I made any decision on VA's website or in their emails, the visible information was always INCREDIBLY misleading. The Terms and Conditions are down at the bottom somewhere, a light gray link in size 4 font on a slightly darker gray background, and the reason they do everything in their power to hide the Terms and Conditions is because they are toxic. They are the least consumer-friendly policies of any company I have ever dealt with ever. 

So, if you have a very precise route and time in mind and you are 100% confident nothing will happen to disrupt that, and the sloppy constellation of oddball locations happens to line up for you, I guess VA isn't your worst bet. But if you have even the SLIGHTEST worry that something might come up, or that you might have to deal with these people for ANY reason, run. Run as far and as fast as you possibly can.

"1509665206.0"|"Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it..."|"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?"
"1482496010.0"|"An Open Letter to the CEO of Frontier Airlines"|"An open letter to Mr. Barry L. Biffle, CEO of Frontier Airlines.

Dear Mr. Biffle,
I thought you might be interested in knowing how well Frontier did this holiday season.

My family?s plan was straightforward.  I?m in the military, currently stationed in Australia, having served in Korea the year before.  I haven?t seen my family in 12 months, with the exception of two one-week windows during the summer.  Once when I was helping put my mother in hospice care, and again at her funeral.  This holiday season was the perfect time for a family vacation to Disney World.  My four year old is at the magic age where a hug from Tigger IS a hug from Tigger, and not a guy in a suit.  My daughter is a senior in High School, and this Christmas was going to be the golden time for one last family vacation before she pushed out into her adult life.  We even convinced my father to meet us down in Orlando, so he wouldn?t spend his first Christmas season alone.  When my daughter graduates, my family will join me in Australia, and trips to Disney, or even to visit my father, would be cost prohibitive.  This holiday season was supposed to be the time for me to have that family vacation where I could reconnect with my family.  We had a condo lined up for the week before Christmas at a beautiful resort (seven swimming pools!).  I flew in from Australia on the 15th, and would leave from Colorado Springs with my 17 year old and four year old on 17 December.  My wife and 13 year old son would join us on the 18th, since he was competing in the State of Colorado First Lego League Championships.  My father would fly down from Michigan on the 18th as well, staying at the same resort.  Maybe not the simplest, but a straightforward plan nonetheless.  Frontier Airlines seemed the perfect airlines to transport a family of five.  I wasn?t looking for frills, and I had never had a problem with them before.

There had been some weather overnight, and on the morning of the 17th, my wife checked your website to find the flight had been cancelled.  It seemed odd that it was cancelled so early, especially given other flights from other airlines didn?t seem to be cancelled.  But, the weather was bad, and I acknowledge weather can indeed have cascading effects on airlines.  Throughout that day, I spent a total of nine hours on hold.  You might be unaware of it, but the way your phone system is designed, it automatically disconnects when someone is on hold for four hours.  You might want to consider investing in one of those ?call-back? systems, instead of subjecting people to four hours of Frontier propaganda on how great the airline is.  By the time I reached a customer service rep, I managed to get me and two of my kids booked for the 19th.  I?d also like to point out that I never received an email, or any notification the flight was cancelled.  In fact, your voice system was still tracking it as on time.  If my wife hadn?t decided to check the website, I wouldn?t have known until I arrived at the airport.  I was losing two days from my vacation, but I could live with that.  The worst part was telling my four year old we weren?t going to Disney that day.

The plan was manageable.  I called the condo and rental car company and let them know my wife wouldn?t be checking in until the 18th.  She and my son would meet my dad in Orlando.  They would spend the day shopping for food, getting Disney tickets, and preparing for me and my other two kids to arrive on the 19th  Not an ideal plan (I was paying for a night at the condo that wasn?t being used), but totally manageable.  As we loaded their bags into our van so I could drive them to the airport, my wife received an email saying the flight was cancelled.  This was a total shock.  No other airline was cancelling flights, and I had been checking the website all day; there was no indication it was cancelled until two hours and twenty minutes before the flight.  It was allegedly cancelled because of weather.  Yet no other airline was having weather issues.  Your plane makes an Orlando-Phoenix-Colorado Springs loop.  Weather at all three airports was clear.  I spend another three hours on hold, and finally get a customer service representative.  She tells me I can get a refund or reschedule the flight for the evening of the 23rd.  Which would give my wife and son a grand total of ONE day at Disney World before our flight back the morning of the 25th.  

The plan was expensive.  I got a refund, and managed to get two tickets via Delta for the morning of the 20th.  The tickets were a little out of my price range, but it was worth being together as a family.  I called the condo and told them to hold the room until the next night (again paying for a night that I wasn?t able to use).  I lost the rental car reservation, and am unsure whether I will be refunded the money I spent on the voucher.  My father was now alone in Orlando with no family.  I had just blown my budget for the vacation buying last minute tickets.  But we would be together as a family, and I wouldn?t have to tell my four year old we weren?t going to see Mickey.  It wasn?t an ideal plan, it had gotten very expensive, but in the end, everyone would be together and happy right?  I spent all day on the 19th checking not only my flight status, but the flight from Phoenix to Colorado Springs.  Both were on time for most of the day, but before I left for the airport, the website showed a 40 minute delay.  We pack our van up, load up me and two kids, and head to the airport.  We arrive at the airport, and check in.  The lady behind the counter says the flight is delayed, but when I ask if the plane is even in Phoenix, she says yes.  Having looked at the weather map, I know the weather between Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Orlando is good.  It looks like everything is on track!  My four year old is higher than a kite, almost impossible to control as he gets more and more excited about leaving.  He points out every plane through the window as we walk to our gate, absolutely sure that the plane he is pointing to is the plane that is going to take us to Mickey. As we get to the gate, a board notifies us that the flight will be delayed two hours.  I don?t understand why, since the plane is in Phoenix, and the weather is clear.  But ok.  Our bags are checked, every employee is saying we are going to be taking off.  I settle in, and work on occupying a hyperactive four year old.  Then all hell breaks loose.

The plan was a Cluster*#@!.  It started as a rumor, and quickly spread.  The flight had been cancelled.  No Frontier employees were around, but everyone pulls out their phone and checks the website, sure enough it reads cancelled.  People begin to call Frontier (interestingly enough, most people had that number handy).  No employees at the gate.  Zero.  Zilch.  People begin to line up.  As I go to get into line, my four year old begins to cry as he realizes he isn?t getting on the plane.  After about twenty minutes, three Frontier employees march up to the podium, and have the audacity to tell us the weather had caused the flight to be cancelled.  What?  For three days in a row, Frontier had cancelled a flight because of ?weather.?  When it was pointed out that the weather wasn?t bad in any of the three locations, the employee stated that it was because the weather had prevented a rested crew from getting to Phoenix.  What?  The flight hadn?t flown for three days and you didn?t have a rested crew?  You couldn?t get a rested crew to the correct location?  This rings as untrue and disingenuous (heck, use a different airline and fly a crew to Phoenix).  It gets better.  Your employees state they weren?t even going to try to rebook.  You could either get a refund or call the toll-free number to try to rebook (but nothing was available until after Christmas).  And because the cancellation was caused by ?weather,? no vouchers for hotels or flights would be given.  Apparently Frontier is effected differently by the weather than other (more reputable) airlines are.  So to sum up so far, I?ve paid for three nights on a condo that I haven?t used.  Lost a rental car reservation.  My recently widowed father is alone in Orlando.  I have two tickets to Orlando on Delta schedule to fly out on the 20th, but three members of my family with no tickets.

As I type this, my wife is trying to enjoy Disney World with my father, and our four year old (at $1300 for last minute ticket, I couldn?t afford for my whole family to fly).  From the pictures I?ve been sent, his smile is something to make the meanest villain smile and remember fond childhood memories.  For the last six months, I was looking forward to being with my family (and seeing that smile in person), and having one last family vacation.  Now I sit with my two teenagers binge watching TV (I should have never given the 17 year old the control of the remote), and missing out on the joys of my family being together.  Your airline absolutely ruined one of the (if not the) last family vacations I will have before my daughter leaves the house.  After 18 months away from my four year old, I missed an opportunity to bond with him, and a chance for him to be with his father on the happiest place on earth.  Your airlines brought stress, unanticipated expenses, and ultimately unhappiness to my family.  To be succinct, your airline sucks the joy out of life and turns the tolerable experience of flying into a living nightmare.

So why do I write to you.  Well for a few reasons.  One part of me wishes that investors see this, and realize what a sinking ship your company is.  This will in-turn prevent you from taking the company public, and as word of your crappy and unreliable service spreads, the private owners of the company will take a shellacking while the company goes belly-up.  Another part of me wishes that you realize how horribly your company is doing, and in a public relations stunt, you provide an all-expenses paid trip reuniting me and my family in Disney World.  Both unlikely, so instead, allow me to provide you some pointed feedback you need to make if you want your company to survive this fiasco.
?	Remember that travelers value reliability above comfort and price.  It?s great to only pay for what I want to use, but if you can?t guarantee that you?ll have me in the right place at the right time, then your airline is useless to me.  Yours was the only airline effected so drastically by the weather.  Most airlines had righted their ship within 6 hours of the storms.  Yours took longer than 72 hours, and still left people stranded.  You need to build up redundancy in your airline to anticipate weather/maintenance/mismanagement.  It might cost you more in operating expenses, but in the long run, you will keep customers coming back.  All the last 96 hours did was create thousands of people who will never fly Frontier again (and their families).  Ryanair, the epitome of no frills and cheap, is, at its core, reliable.

?	Have transparency when talking to your clients.  We are not idiots.  I know no other airline was affected by weather.  I know the weather at the three cities in question was flyable.  I know planes can travel over and around bad weather between cities.  Don?t piss on my leg and tell me it?s raining.  If the other rumors that this was really caused by a sick-out/strike are true, then you need to tell people that.  If an employee said ?hey, we can rebook you, but we think there is a sick-out going on, it?s up to you,? then I can make the choice if I want to risk it.  Instead you strung me along for three days, each day costing me more money.

?	Own your mistakes.  Weather may have provided the first wrinkle, but let?s be honest, your employees mismanaged planes and crews.  And you need to own that mistake.  And then you need to throw free stuff at people.  If you refunded my $1000 in tickets and gave me a $2000 voucher to use over the next two years, do you think I would be bitching right now?  No.  I would be telling people that Frontier had some major problems, but they went out of their way to try and make things right.  Instead I?m telling people I will never fly Frontier again, and they ruined my last chance at a family vacation after being apart from them for a year.  Oh, and since we both know it wasn?t weather, then there wouldn?t have been countless hours by your clients and employees rebooking flights that weren?t really going to take off.

?	Invest in some customer service infrastructure.  I spent over 12 hours on hold over a 48 hour period.  Hire another call center.  Or update your system to allow call-backs so I don?t have to wait with my ear to the phone.  If you do choose to ignore any of my advice, please at least change your on-hold message.  Plug in a radio station or comedy channel or something.  But for the love of god, recognize that four hours of your propaganda is cruel and unusual.


Mr. Biffle, your mistake was cutting so many costs that you couldn?t handle a simple (and expected) down turn in weather.  Whether it was lack of redundancy, mismanagement of resources, or alienated pilots, you?ve cut too many corners to try and stay cheap.  If you aren?t viewing the events of 17-19 December as an existential crisis of your airlines, then you are misreading the American public, and our tolerance for incompetence with high value items.  You are about to make Frontier the Schlitz Beer of the airline industry, destined to be a case study to MBA students on how to turn a viable company into a footnote.  I saw the lines at the counter and endured the hold time, there is a demand for your services, but people will never demand crappy service for hundreds of dollars, and that, sir, is what you are currently providing.

Sincerely,
B. Novak

I am just looking what's the best thing for me to do and some advice on how to proceed on this nightmare that I faced last month. Also, is there any hope to get any percentage of money refunded - either for departure or return tickets.

**Here's the story (sorry it?s long):**
Couple months ago, I bought a round trip ticket for last month from PHL to DEL (New Delhi, India) on Virgin Atlantic last month. The connecting flights were from PHL to JFK (with Delta - partnering with Virgin Atlantic), JFK to LHR (with Virgin Atlantic), and LHR to DEL (Virgin Atlantic). 

This was my first time flying with Virgin Atlantic. And here was my US Visa situation - I had an expired H1-B visa and I was flying to India to get the Visa renewed. Actually, the visa was already renewed by my employer, so I just need a new Visa stamp in an US consulate, which can only be done outside the US. I confirmed with a Virgin Atlantic customer service agent before flying that my Visa situation would not be an issue on the date of flying.

On the date of the flight, the Delta staff at PHL boarded me to JFK. Once I landed in JFK, the Virgin Atlantic staff at the JFK boarding gate refused to board me. They mentioned that I did not have an UK issued transit visa required for me to go through LHR. What bothered me most is that the staff there looked at all of my documents - my passport, current and expired visa documents - and falsely (I will explain why falsely later) claimed that I do not even have the right Visa documents for United States. They said ?You do not have an US Visa or proper documents, you cannot leave this country and fly anywhere?. In reality, I actually did have all the paper work that I needed to leave the country, go to India, get my visa stamped at an US consulate, and then return back. 

I have been in United States for last 14 years, and this was the worst example of customer service I had ever experienced in my life. The staff were extremely rude, condescending, simply refused to help me, or find me another Virgin Atlantic flight that goes through other routes to DEL. 

When I called Virgin Atlantic customer service for further help, the staff on the phone couldn?t also help me with other routes. They had already flew me from PHL to JFK, so now I am stuck in the middle of my journey in an airport far from my home (Philly) without any help from Virgin Atlantic. If this were still in Philly, I could have just driven home and planned  something better. 

I called the customer service again - this time to cancel the remainder of my journey and they said that I needed to pay $200 more to cancel the remaining trip. I asked if I get a travel voucher instead - and they said that would also cost my additional money ($200+ more). When I asked if I can get a refund, they said the tickets are non-refundable and I needed to talk to my travel agent. I put Virgin Atlantic staff and my travel agent representative on a conference call. Essentially, the travel agent mentioned that the money is already processed by Virgin Atlantic, so VA needs to refund it. And Virgin Atlantic staff refused to proceed with any refund.

Finally, I had to purchase another direct flight on a different airlines (United) from a different airport (EWR) which cost me an arm and a leg. The tickets I bought for Virgin Atlantic were simply a waste since I could neither use them nor get any money for refund. 

In addition to all that, Delta lost my checked in luggage when I flew from PHL to JFK and they couldn?t find my bag in JFK airport. It took them more than 10 days to find my bag (well, more like after repeatedly calling them and trying to identify the location of my bag and unable to get any response from them, I simply drove to the airport in DEL, and found my bag lying near their airport counter, unattended).

Given the terrible experience with Virgin Atlantic, I did not take the return flight with them - so those return tickets were also wasted.

The United flight was a direct flight from EWR to DEL - the staff there did not have any issues with my documentations. And in the US Embassy in New Delhi, I got my Visa stamped instantly - the embassy staff there mentioned that I have been in US for long enough and I had all the right documentations for me to get it instantly approved - contradicting Virgin Atlantic boarding gate staff?s theory that I did not have the right US Visa documentations and hence their ground for refusal to board me. 

**tl;dr** - Virgin Atlantic (in partnership with Delta) flew me from PHL to JFK, before refusing to board me at JFK. Then they refused to refund my money and Delta misplaced my baggage for more than a week.

According to [https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html](https://www.transportation.gov/affairs/2012/dot0812.html)

""Passengers will be able to hold a reservation without payment, or cancel a booking without penalty, for 24 hours after the reservation is made, if they make the reservation one week or more prior to a flight?s departure date.""

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

So I disputed the $200 fee with my bank, and just now I've realized that I lost the dispute.

As for the 3rd party, if it was a 3rd party who booked this, it was an @travelersdesks.com email address who sent me confirmation. Does anyone know what company this is? I was in contact with them through Delta's direct customer service line +18002211212 from an agent claiming to be a supervisor."

"2015-04-14 22:46:56"|"My cellphone has been stuck in the guts of a Delta Airlines jet for a month"|"So a month ago my cellphone fell out of my pocket on takeoff and down into the inner workings of Delta Airlines Jet.  They said they would mail it back to me when they were able to dig it out but it's been a month and other than the ""we received your complaint"" auto-response email I have heard nothing from Delta.  I am open to suggestions on how to resolve this properly.

This is the message I sent to Delta Airlines:  

To Whom It May Concern At Delta,

During takeoff on DELTA 2379 on the morning of 3/16/2015 my cellphone slid out of my coat pocket and fell through a gap in the floor that should have never been there in the first place. 

There are these plastic panels that are supposed to be attached where the floor of the cabin and the curve of the plane fuselage meet.  I noticed that in my window seat ( 39F or 41F, I can't recall exactly, only that it was a window seat) that the panel to the right of the window seat directly in front of me was completely detached and being propped up by the bracket the seat is mounted to.  You could easily see a couple feet down into the plane through the hole.  The panel next to my seat was still basically attached but was shoved in at the bottom leaving about a two inch gap.  A gap, as it turns out, that is big enough for cellphone to fall through.

I had initially assumed my phone was just on the floor somewhere after I dropped it and that I would probably have to  wait until we landed at Minneapolis-Saint Paul to look for it, given the confines of the seating arrangement.  It was only when I was unable to find my phone anywhere where it would be reasonable expected to be found given the layout that I noticed the missing and shoved-in panels.  I theorized that it had probably fallen through one of the shoved-in/defective panel gap(s) and I voiced my concerns as such.  The flight crew were all standing around discussing what could be done, even the captain had come back to see what all the fuss was about.  I was told they were going to get an engineer to look for it while the plane was being prepared for it's next and within the hour take off.  

After about 20 minutes I asked a Delta associate behind the desk if she knew anything about the lost phone, and was told, after she went back down the ramp to ask, that they had indeed found my phone and that it had indeed fallen through the gap in the shoved-in panel and into the ""guts"" of the plane.  After not being able to reach it with the tools they had I was informed that they, understandably, aren't going to hold up a plane to fish out someone's cellphone, and that they would mail my phone back to me when they have more time to get it out.  They took down my address and info and I left to catch my connecting flight to Washington-Reagan.

I've just spent the last week driving my afraid-to-fly daughter and her two cats from Washington, DC to Medford, OR.  a 3,000+ mile trip where a cellphone full of important family contact info and working GPS is all but essential.  I went ahead and purchased a cheap cellphone and a prepaid SIM card, there was really no choice in the matter.  The phone is unfortunately horribly inferior to the Samsung Galaxy 5s of mine that is (probably), still ""flying the friendly skies"" for free wedged deep down inside the plane.  

I still have not received said phone back nor heard a word from Delta about it and can only surmise that they didn't bother or were unable to actually retrieve the aforementioned glass and metal electronic device from inside the body of the plane.

So it comes down to this: were it not for the sorry and disturbingly-poor state of the floor panels my phone would have never gotten lost in the innards of this plane.  Had the cabin been properly maintained this would have never been the huge problem it has turned into.  It is not unreasonable to expect a plane to be maintained at least to the level were it is somewhat difficult for electronic devices to fall into it's inner workings.  If my phone is not returned within the next couple weeks I expect Delta to either replace it with the exact same model or compensate me for its worth.  This is generously-reasonable request given the circumstances.

I eagerly await your reply.

Regards,

"2016-08-16 12:55:29"|"Fiance an I removed from Delta Flight due to glitch"|"So I've got a few questions here, I've already contacted the Department of Transportation in the USA, however I need to know about baggage. First you need backstory.

Basically my Fiance an I were 2 hours early to our flight, we were checked in and everything was good, itinerary, boarding pass, tickets etc all for the 9th of August. When it came time to board our tickets flashed red with an error about ""lack of flight crew"" or something, but the gate agent saw we had the right boarding passes and let us on.

Once on the plane a lady ended up getting the same seat number as me (she was someone who was changed over to this flight to Seattle because she had missed hers the day before). After about 10 minutes, the gate crew turned up and told my fiance an I that we had to leave the plane. We showed them our boarding pass, and tickets etc, and they just said ""you need to get off"".

We had no idea at this point what the hell was going on. When we got back to the gate they told us ""You booked your tickets for tomorrow, not today"". Red flags instantly went up, we were like ""hold on no we didn't?"" they wouldn't help us there, they told us we had to go back to the booking counter and sort it out there, so we did. Once there they told us the same thing ""you booked for tomorrow"". The lady who actually sent us through 2 hours earlier appeared and questioned why we were there, we told her and she said ""It said the 9th, their itinerary and everything is for the 9th"" that's when they went ""oops, it's just a glitch...you were meant to be on that flight"". I should point out that the flight had more than 10 seats left, so it was in no way full.

After 3 hours of piss arsing on their end, and explaining that I HAD to get back to Australia for an important VISA interview, they finally got us onto some flights. This is where it got even more stupid. They were unable to check our baggage in, and tried to tell us that we couldn't get on the flight because their system wouldn't let us check our baggage...until finally one of the guys was like ""We do have manual tickets you know"". So they got us manual tickets through the gate, and our luggage was put on there. Please note we had to fly to Seattle using Atlantic, because Delta had already left with no other flights for the day to Seattle.

Our next stop over from Seattle was to LAX, we arrived with 30 minutes to spare before we had to get on, and were assured our luggage was safely going to LAX.

So once we arrived in LAX, we had at least a bit of leeway with time, a good 1 hour and a half! To get to our gate. So we made it there, and turns out they gave our seats away! SHOCK! Well Delta did, at this point we were going to be flying through with Virgin, but it seems Delta didn't reiterate them our seats....eventually they sorted that out and we managed to get on the plane. We waited 2 hours....the plane wasn't leaving. Why? Apparently 22 passengers were missing from the plane, so they had to take their luggage off. Which was weird, because it sure as hell didn't look like 22 passengers were missing from the bloody plane.

Anyway after 14 hours we arrived back in Brisbane, and...no luggage. Nothing. In fact, it wasn't just my fiance an I, it was about 22 of us or so that lost our luggage. Turns out Delta's system didn't really relay to them correctly on luggage.

Anyway it took them 4 days to get our luggage back to us, now we've run into the issues in trying to get compensation.

Virgin Australia doesn't seem to have the option to make a claim for delayed luggage, in fact the details on my page are not up to date properly and seem to be reading wrong, not to mention they managed to screw up my email. On top of that we can't make a claim through Delta because we don't have a number for Delta's site that works.

So what I want to know is...what can we do? We had to spend about $200AUD just to get clothes and toiletries for the 4 days we had NOTHING. Do I call them? Or am I fresh out of luck?



Also they offered us absolutely NO compensation when they involuntarily removed us from the flight in the first place, nothing at all. They told us that we needed to come the next day....to flights that didn't even exist on their website or on their own database!"

The only reasonable flights are flying Frontier to and between Frontier, US Airways, and American Airlines flying back. I've only ever flown JetBlue before, and have only ever had good experiences with them.

My question is, basically, how are your experiences onboard with those airlines? Like, with JetBlue, you get free snack and beverages, and are also able to watch tv. Although, those things are not important to me, but they definitely make the trip more comfortable.

My friend(who is a huge enthusiast of anything aircraft and also works at an airport) recommended Delta over American. So basically, which airline/s out of the ones I've mentioned would you most recommend? I know it probably doesn't matter, but I figured I ask for everyone's opinion on which they prefer."

I took a flight from Calgary and when u arrived to go through immigration they told me my flight was canceled. I later went to a JetWest representative who said it was due to traffic control and something about weather at LGA (Sounds like BS) as I checked weather for New York and it is perfectly fine. I was told to contact JetWest for reimbursement and was told that I would not get ANY compensation because it was not there fault. This is ridiculous. On my way to Calagary, my flight to Toronto was delayed heavily and I missed my flight to Calgary. There, I had to wait 9 hours for the next flight and given no compensation. I can somewhat understand the departure flight issue and why I wasn't given anything but I do not understand why I cannot receive imbursement for my arriving flight to New York even if I don't take the flight as I am trying to take a rental car to New York. The tight grip that airlines have on passengers is aburd and something should really be done about this. 

EDIT:
I was told I can take a flight tomorrow from Toronto to Atlanta and then later that day from Atlanta to LaGuardia using Delta Airlines. That is the only option WestJet has given me. It is not a suitable option because I cannot miss another day of work. I also have to book a hotel now. "
"2016-12-23 07:26:50"|"An Open Letter to the CEO of Frontier Airlines"|"An open letter to Mr. Barry L. Biffle, CEO of Frontier Airlines.

Dear Mr. Biffle,
I thought you might be interested in knowing how well Frontier did this holiday season.

My family?s plan was straightforward.  I?m in the military, currently stationed in Australia, having served in Korea the year before.  I haven?t seen my family in 12 months, with the exception of two one-week windows during the summer.  Once when I was helping put my mother in hospice care, and again at her funeral.  This holiday season was the perfect time for a family vacation to Disney World.  My four year old is at the magic age where a hug from Tigger IS a hug from Tigger, and not a guy in a suit.  My daughter is a senior in High School, and this Christmas was going to be the golden time for one last family vacation before she pushed out into her adult life.  We even convinced my father to meet us down in Orlando, so he wouldn?t spend his first Christmas season alone.  When my daughter graduates, my family will join me in Australia, and trips to Disney, or even to visit my father, would be cost prohibitive.  This holiday season was supposed to be the time for me to have that family vacation where I could reconnect with my family.  We had a condo lined up for the week before Christmas at a beautiful resort (seven swimming pools!).  I flew in from Australia on the 15th, and would leave from Colorado Springs with my 17 year old and four year old on 17 December.  My wife and 13 year old son would join us on the 18th, since he was competing in the State of Colorado First Lego League Championships.  My father would fly down from Michigan on the 18th as well, staying at the same resort.  Maybe not the simplest, but a straightforward plan nonetheless.  Frontier Airlines seemed the perfect airlines to transport a family of five.  I wasn?t looking for frills, and I had never had a problem with them before.

There had been some weather overnight, and on the morning of the 17th, my wife checked your website to find the flight had been cancelled.  It seemed odd that it was cancelled so early, especially given other flights from other airlines didn?t seem to be cancelled.  But, the weather was bad, and I acknowledge weather can indeed have cascading effects on airlines.  Throughout that day, I spent a total of nine hours on hold.  You might be unaware of it, but the way your phone system is designed, it automatically disconnects when someone is on hold for four hours.  You might want to consider investing in one of those ?call-back? systems, instead of subjecting people to four hours of Frontier propaganda on how great the airline is.  By the time I reached a customer service rep, I managed to get me and two of my kids booked for the 19th.  I?d also like to point out that I never received an email, or any notification the flight was cancelled.  In fact, your voice system was still tracking it as on time.  If my wife hadn?t decided to check the website, I wouldn?t have known until I arrived at the airport.  I was losing two days from my vacation, but I could live with that.  The worst part was telling my four year old we weren?t going to Disney that day.

The plan was manageable.  I called the condo and rental car company and let them know my wife wouldn?t be checking in until the 18th.  She and my son would meet my dad in Orlando.  They would spend the day shopping for food, getting Disney tickets, and preparing for me and my other two kids to arrive on the 19th  Not an ideal plan (I was paying for a night at the condo that wasn?t being used), but totally manageable.  As we loaded their bags into our van so I could drive them to the airport, my wife received an email saying the flight was cancelled.  This was a total shock.  No other airline was cancelling flights, and I had been checking the website all day; there was no indication it was cancelled until two hours and twenty minutes before the flight.  It was allegedly cancelled because of weather.  Yet no other airline was having weather issues.  Your plane makes an Orlando-Phoenix-Colorado Springs loop.  Weather at all three airports was clear.  I spend another three hours on hold, and finally get a customer service representative.  She tells me I can get a refund or reschedule the flight for the evening of the 23rd.  Which would give my wife and son a grand total of ONE day at Disney World before our flight back the morning of the 25th.  

The plan was expensive.  I got a refund, and managed to get two tickets via Delta for the morning of the 20th.  The tickets were a little out of my price range, but it was worth being together as a family.  I called the condo and told them to hold the room until the next night (again paying for a night that I wasn?t able to use).  I lost the rental car reservation, and am unsure whether I will be refunded the money I spent on the voucher.  My father was now alone in Orlando with no family.  I had just blown my budget for the vacation buying last minute tickets.  But we would be together as a family, and I wouldn?t have to tell my four year old we weren?t going to see Mickey.  It wasn?t an ideal plan, it had gotten very expensive, but in the end, everyone would be together and happy right?  I spent all day on the 19th checking not only my flight status, but the flight from Phoenix to Colorado Springs.  Both were on time for most of the day, but before I left for the airport, the website showed a 40 minute delay.  We pack our van up, load up me and two kids, and head to the airport.  We arrive at the airport, and check in.  The lady behind the counter says the flight is delayed, but when I ask if the plane is even in Phoenix, she says yes.  Having looked at the weather map, I know the weather between Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Orlando is good.  It looks like everything is on track!  My four year old is higher than a kite, almost impossible to control as he gets more and more excited about leaving.  He points out every plane through the window as we walk to our gate, absolutely sure that the plane he is pointing to is the plane that is going to take us to Mickey. As we get to the gate, a board notifies us that the flight will be delayed two hours.  I don?t understand why, since the plane is in Phoenix, and the weather is clear.  But ok.  Our bags are checked, every employee is saying we are going to be taking off.  I settle in, and work on occupying a hyperactive four year old.  Then all hell breaks loose.

The plan was a Cluster*#@!.  It started as a rumor, and quickly spread.  The flight had been cancelled.  No Frontier employees were around, but everyone pulls out their phone and checks the website, sure enough it reads cancelled.  People begin to call Frontier (interestingly enough, most people had that number handy).  No employees at the gate.  Zero.  Zilch.  People begin to line up.  As I go to get into line, my four year old begins to cry as he realizes he isn?t getting on the plane.  After about twenty minutes, three Frontier employees march up to the podium, and have the audacity to tell us the weather had caused the flight to be cancelled.  What?  For three days in a row, Frontier had cancelled a flight because of ?weather.?  When it was pointed out that the weather wasn?t bad in any of the three locations, the employee stated that it was because the weather had prevented a rested crew from getting to Phoenix.  What?  The flight hadn?t flown for three days and you didn?t have a rested crew?  You couldn?t get a rested crew to the correct location?  This rings as untrue and disingenuous (heck, use a different airline and fly a crew to Phoenix).  It gets better.  Your employees state they weren?t even going to try to rebook.  You could either get a refund or call the toll-free number to try to rebook (but nothing was available until after Christmas).  And because the cancellation was caused by ?weather,? no vouchers for hotels or flights would be given.  Apparently Frontier is effected differently by the weather than other (more reputable) airlines are.  So to sum up so far, I?ve paid for three nights on a condo that I haven?t used.  Lost a rental car reservation.  My recently widowed father is alone in Orlando.  I have two tickets to Orlando on Delta schedule to fly out on the 20th, but three members of my family with no tickets.

As I type this, my wife is trying to enjoy Disney World with my father, and our four year old (at $1300 for last minute ticket, I couldn?t afford for my whole family to fly).  From the pictures I?ve been sent, his smile is something to make the meanest villain smile and remember fond childhood memories.  For the last six months, I was looking forward to being with my family (and seeing that smile in person), and having one last family vacation.  Now I sit with my two teenagers binge watching TV (I should have never given the 17 year old the control of the remote), and missing out on the joys of my family being together.  Your airline absolutely ruined one of the (if not the) last family vacations I will have before my daughter leaves the house.  After 18 months away from my four year old, I missed an opportunity to bond with him, and a chance for him to be with his father on the happiest place on earth.  Your airlines brought stress, unanticipated expenses, and ultimately unhappiness to my family.  To be succinct, your airline sucks the joy out of life and turns the tolerable experience of flying into a living nightmare.

So why do I write to you.  Well for a few reasons.  One part of me wishes that investors see this, and realize what a sinking ship your company is.  This will in-turn prevent you from taking the company public, and as word of your crappy and unreliable service spreads, the private owners of the company will take a shellacking while the company goes belly-up.  Another part of me wishes that you realize how horribly your company is doing, and in a public relations stunt, you provide an all-expenses paid trip reuniting me and my family in Disney World.  Both unlikely, so instead, allow me to provide you some pointed feedback you need to make if you want your company to survive this fiasco.
?	Remember that travelers value reliability above comfort and price.  It?s great to only pay for what I want to use, but if you can?t guarantee that you?ll have me in the right place at the right time, then your airline is useless to me.  Yours was the only airline effected so drastically by the weather.  Most airlines had righted their ship within 6 hours of the storms.  Yours took longer than 72 hours, and still left people stranded.  You need to build up redundancy in your airline to anticipate weather/maintenance/mismanagement.  It might cost you more in operating expenses, but in the long run, you will keep customers coming back.  All the last 96 hours did was create thousands of people who will never fly Frontier again (and their families).  Ryanair, the epitome of no frills and cheap, is, at its core, reliable.

?	Have transparency when talking to your clients.  We are not idiots.  I know no other airline was affected by weather.  I know the weather at the three cities in question was flyable.  I know planes can travel over and around bad weather between cities.  Don?t piss on my leg and tell me it?s raining.  If the other rumors that this was really caused by a sick-out/strike are true, then you need to tell people that.  If an employee said ?hey, we can rebook you, but we think there is a sick-out going on, it?s up to you,? then I can make the choice if I want to risk it.  Instead you strung me along for three days, each day costing me more money.

?	Own your mistakes.  Weather may have provided the first wrinkle, but let?s be honest, your employees mismanaged planes and crews.  And you need to own that mistake.  And then you need to throw free stuff at people.  If you refunded my $1000 in tickets and gave me a $2000 voucher to use over the next two years, do you think I would be bitching right now?  No.  I would be telling people that Frontier had some major problems, but they went out of their way to try and make things right.  Instead I?m telling people I will never fly Frontier again, and they ruined my last chance at a family vacation after being apart from them for a year.  Oh, and since we both know it wasn?t weather, then there wouldn?t have been countless hours by your clients and employees rebooking flights that weren?t really going to take off.

?	Invest in some customer service infrastructure.  I spent over 12 hours on hold over a 48 hour period.  Hire another call center.  Or update your system to allow call-backs so I don?t have to wait with my ear to the phone.  If you do choose to ignore any of my advice, please at least change your on-hold message.  Plug in a radio station or comedy channel or something.  But for the love of god, recognize that four hours of your propaganda is cruel and unusual.


Mr. Biffle, your mistake was cutting so many costs that you couldn?t handle a simple (and expected) down turn in weather.  Whether it was lack of redundancy, mismanagement of resources, or alienated pilots, you?ve cut too many corners to try and stay cheap.  If you aren?t viewing the events of 17-19 December as an existential crisis of your airlines, then you are misreading the American public, and our tolerance for incompetence with high value items.  You are about to make Frontier the Schlitz Beer of the airline industry, destined to be a case study to MBA students on how to turn a viable company into a footnote.  I saw the lines at the counter and endured the hold time, there is a demand for your services, but people will never demand crappy service for hundreds of dollars, and that, sir, is what you are currently providing.

You're required to call the airlines 24 hours before you flight? Paying for the damn ticket isn't enough? I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to keep a ticket I already paid for. I've got an Alaskan cruise at the end of the month, and my return flight is a different airline than I'm going out on. Why the hell should I be expected to call Delta from Canada the day before I get back? ""EZ Air"" my ass.

I drove her to the airport and dropped her off on time for her flight. The second delay caused her to not be able to make her connection. 
The supervisor told her it was their fault and due to crew issues, but that they couldn't do anything because it was late in the day. The supervisor said that she may be able to get a hotel voucher at the airport of her connection, but arrangements could not be made ahead of time.
My mom didn't like the idea of flying and not having definitive plans for the night. I picked her up and will be driving her to the airport again tomorrow morning before work starts for me. My mother will also have to take another personal day. Given that this delay was due to crew issues and not weather or something beyond Delta's control can my mother get reimbursed in any way?"

Our flight was scheduled for early this morning, flying direct from Austin, TX to DTW.  We got emailed at 5 AM, just before we woke up to get to the airport. I called to ask about rescheduling, but the wait time on the phone was more than an hour, so we needed to go to the airport anyways.  We were told there was severe weather issues, but the only airline affected was spirit and the only flight affected was ours. All other airlines we're running and spirit was backed up all the way down the hall, we didn't move for over an hour. This same issue happened the day before, and the people in line behind us were ""rebooked"" for today's flight, which got cancelled again. We ended up going with another airline to just get home, and after the BS of trying to get a refund for 3 hours on the phone, will never fly with them again. Is there anything else we are able to do to avoid this in the future? Is spirit on the hook for anything more than just a refund since they gave us just over 2 hours of notice? We couldn't sit another 2 hours in line to get to the spirit desk, but in the hour we spent waiting, they moved just a couple of people to empty seats on a Delta flight, is there a reason they didn't move more people?

I have an update regarding my situation as [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/42hdq9/virgin_atlantic_refused_to_board_me_after_flying/)

After advice from the comments, I haven't contacted Virgin Atlantic yet knowing that I have a weaker case against them.

However, Delta's claim officer called me couple days ago and said that since my flight plan was cancelled by Virgin Atlantic, it's not Delta's fault that they delayed my bags for over a week, so they won't reimburse me anything.

Here's the story about the lost baggage. Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. The whole experience has been super expensive and frustrating for me.

**December 14th, 7 AM** - I flew from PHL to JFK in Delta. 

**8 AM** - I landed in JFK. I was at the Virgin Atlantic's boarding gate for about 45 minutes trying to figure out my travel situation. The VA agents at the boarding gate told me that my bag has been pulled out of the plane and I can collect it from Delta's baggage claim.

**8:45 AM** - When I went downstairs to the baggage claim, I couldn't find my bag. I spoke to Delta agents and they said that *""yes, your bag was pulled out of the plane, but one of our staff made a mistake and put it back on the queue. But your bag is still in the JFK airport. We will have baggage handling guys pull it out from the queue and bring it back here. You can come back after 30-40 minutes to pick it up.""*

**9:00 - 9:30 AM** - I used those 30 minutes to step out to the lounge area and figure out the rest of the trip. I finally booked my tickets with United and made travel arrangements to go to EWR from JFK (neither VA nor Delta helped me here, off course).

**9:30 - 4 PM** - When I came back after 30 minutes, I found my bag was still missing. I checked again - and they said, they are having someone bring my bag to me and asked me to just wait. Now, this is almost 10 AM. I spent next 6+ hours at the airport in the baggage claim area trying to figure out where my bag was. Delta kept changing their story from *""Wait for few minutes""* to *""It's Virgin Atlantic's fault, talk to them""* (spoke to Virgin Atlantic staff but she didn't even bother to look into their system to find my bag), to finally Delta acknowledging, *""Sorry, we can't find your bag, but we know it's in JFK""*. Delta's baggage claim supervisor tried to find my bag in the system. He said the last time my bag was in Delta's system was at 10:30 AM in one of the racks but when he called a staff in the racks area to retrieve my bag, it was not there. And they don't know where my bag is.

**4 PM** - My flight to United was at 8 PM, but I still needed to take a bus to EWR, do security check up again and figure out if they were also going to refuse to board me. Delta's baggage supervisor said *""sorry we messed up""* many times. They acknowledged that it was their own staff who mistakenly put my bag in the queue AFTER it was pulled out from the VA plane. The supervisor asked me to fill out the claim information. I wrote down my Indian (Delhi) address and Indian phone number, and the supervisor said ""we will deliver your bag to your doorstep in Delhi in a couple days"". I got a tracking number and the supervisor told me to track my bag on www.delta.com/trackbag

**4:30 PM** - I leave for EWR. No issues while boarding there.

**December 15th 10 PM (Indian Time)** - I land in Delhi.  I check delta.com/trackbag. I see that the bag is on a KLM flight (Delta's partner) and is in Amsterdam. And it is scheduled to arrive in Delhi on December 16th. 

**December 16th** - I check delta.com/trackbag - no update in status. I spend entire day at my address to make sure I don't miss the delivery. I called Delta, gave them my tracking ID and my baggage tag number - they couldn't find any information about my bag. Asked me to call back next day when they have more information. Delta's 999 Baggage Assistance emailed me saying the same - they have no information but they are trying to find it. I have that email as a record.

**December 17th** - I check the website - still no updates. I called Delta again, they acknowledge that the bag was enroute to DEL through Amsterdam, but they have no current information. Asked me to give them one more day. Email asked for more details, but didn't provide any idea about what happened to my bag. 

**December 18th (Friday)** - I check the website - still no updates. I call Delta - they had no new information for me. They don't know where my bag is. At 4 PM (1 hour before the airline luggage counters close), I simply drove to the DEL airport. Walked up to the KLM luggage counter at the airport. Found my bag sitting there among a pile of other lost and found bags. The staff there asked me to sign my name before allowing me to take the bag home with me. 

**December 19th (Saturday India Time/Friday EST)** - Received an email from Delta - they still have no clue where my bag is. I told them that I found my bag.

**Fast Forward - last week** - Delta sent an email saying that they were sorry for the delay in my bag and that I would be eligible for any purchases I made during this time. Asked me to send them receipts, which I did.

**Couple days ago** - The Delta claim agent called, asked me to tell her why I got out at JFK. I just mentioned *""I didn't have the right documents for Virgin Atlantic, so needed a different flight""*. And before I could even further explain the rest of the story, she just cut me off and said *""sorry, that's not a Delta problem. We are not liable for delay in your bag if you change plans. You are not eligible for any claim. Bye.""*

So there's where I am right now. I paid a huge price for my one mistake of not checking the transit visa requirements. But tell me, what's the Delta's price for being just incompetent? "

"2017-11-02 19:26:46"|"Could US legacy carriers bring back domestic 3 class service? I see some trends aligning that would seem to make a reasonable case for it..."|"OF course the conventional wisdom is that the economic case for having even 2-class first/economy service is tenuous and that it mainly serves as a concession to the frequent fliers and corporate travelers that represent an ever-decreasing share of revenue-miles, but hear me out, because I think there is good reason for domestic 3 class service to make a comeback. It mainly involves these trends:

1. **The airliners in domestic service are getting significantly larger:** domestic travelers have been flying on a lot of CRJs, E-Jets, MD-8Xs, 737-7s, and A319s in the 100-150 passenger range. That is changing as the legacy carriers are shunning anything smaller than 737-8s and A320s in their future fleet purchase planning. Even 737-7s and A319s are getting completely passed over. *The larger the planes, the more practical it is to have multiple classes.*
2. **Standard economy class seats are getting significantly smaller:** United Airlines economy seat pitch has long been at 30"". American Airlines had been holding at 31"" but they have published plans to cram 172 seats (incl. 16 F) into their new 737-8s (!), at which point I think they are fibbing when they claim that they still have even 30"" of pitch. Delta is holding out at 31"" for now but as we all know, they will follow their 2 competitors soon enough. *Tiny economy seats are what you can expect when legacy carriers are competing for the burgeoning leisure traveler market against low-cost and ultra-low-cost-carriers on the fare aggregators, however they are miserable for the frequent fliers and business travelers who still get price discriminated into higher fares*.
3. **Economy Plus products are still pretty miserable due to seat width:** It doesn't matter how much seat pitch you provide, if you have to sit 3-3 on a 737 or even A320, and anyone in your row has more meat than a supermodel, you are not going to have a good time. You are still literally rubbing shoulders.

Taken together, I think that those trends make the market conditions to a legacy carrier replacing their Economy Plus seats and maybe some of their First Class seats with an intermediate product. Something that isn't nearly as expensive to provide as First Class so the airline can afford to provide it to mid and low-tier frequent fliers (so that they don't go insane paying relatively high prices to fly in Spirit-type conditions), but something substantially differentiated from economy so as to be marketed as a separate class. I would think it would have the 34""-35"" seat pitch of an Economy Plus product, but with 2-3 seating on 737 and A320 types to provide more shoulder room.

For example, American's new 737-8s are planned to have 4 rows of First Class, 3 rows of Economy Plus at the front of the cabin, also treats the 2 exit rows as Economy Plus, and then 21 rows of Economy at (maybe) 30"" pitch. INSTEAD, why not convert 2 of the First Class rows and 1 of the Economy rows into 3 Intermediate Class rows and have something like this:

* 2 rows of First Class 2-2 (8 seats)
* 6 rows of Intermediate Class 2-3 (30 seats) (front of the plane behind F, NOT exit rows)
* 22 rows of Economy 3-3 (132 seats) (includes the exit rows)
* Total 170 seats

This way, they would reduce their F cabin into a size that they can more realistically sell for good cash prices, while still providing a decent product that frequent fliers can upgrade into for free that is substantially differentiated from Economy Plus offerings by way of the 5-across config.

To me, offering free F upgrades to mid-tier frequent fliers never made sense, as nice as it must be. You can get that status by taking a couple international flights, which you can do quite cheaply. Domestic F seats need to sell for ~4X economy seat prices to make much sense. Think about it: on a 3-3 airplane that has 2-2 First Class, just in terms of how much airplane floor area each First Class pax takes up relative to an economy pax, you're talking about a 50% wider seat, with 30% longer seat pitch, with more room required for the F lav, the galley, the bulkhead... by the time you're done you're talking about an F seat taking up about 2.5x as much room as a Y seat, plus you have to provide premium food an amenities, PLUS on shorter flights nobody is willing to pay any premium at all, so on the flights you can actually sell you need to be able to sell for ~4X, and you're just not going to get many pax willing to pay that on most routes and with the decreasing share of biz travel...

In contrast, offer an intermediate product with only 20% wider seats and with only 15% more seat pitch compared to Y, combine it in the same cabin with F to share the bulkhead and dedicated lav(s), maybe offer the same sort of food as economy (but provide for free) and you're talking about a product that takes up less than 1.5x the floor area of an economy seat that you can realistically provide as a free upgrade to frequent fliers without ruining your CASM.

It could also allow the airlines to upgrade their F service with better food and soft products since a greater percentage of the cabin would actually be paying for it. Think about the legacy carriers providing Jetblue Mint level of F food and amenities.

What do you think? Something that could realistically happen? Or am I missing part of the financial equation that makes this idea nonsensical?"

I had spent a month in London (and booked my long-haul flights in and out of there) and then later booked the leg to Spain. On the day I was coming home BA wouldn?t let anyone check-in using their phone and instead had to check-in at the desk. When I went to check-in at Barcelona there was an insane line with 2 agents working it. The agents were doing the typical Spain?s thing and taking their sweet time, taking a break every 20 minutes, etc. Got up to the desk to check-in finally and they were like ?oh yeah your flight closed, sorry?. Then had to go arrange to get on the later flight to London and BA made me pay $300 to do this. This made me miss my other flights which cost $795 to move to the next available flight. BA has not responded to me at all. I?m extremely pissed because it?s their fault their app wasn?t letting people check-in which would?ve let me skip being in a massive check-in line.

According to TSA policy, I am fine (80Wh batteries), however, they state that individual airlines can have their own policies.  TSA policy is:

>Drones, Airwheels, airboards, solowheels, hoverboards, balance boards, balance wheels, and mini-Segways are considered portable electronic devices with lithium ion batteries.

>The allowance for passengers to have portable electronic devices in their checked or carry-on baggage is determined by the size (Watt-hour rating) of the lithium ion battery as follows:

>1) Where the lithium ion battery does not exceed 100 Wh passengers may have these devices in either checked or carry-on baggage.

>2) Where the lithium ion battery exceeds 100 Wh but does not exceed 160 Wh passengers may have these devices in either checked or carry-on baggage, but approval of the airline is required.

>3) Where the lithium ion battery exceeds 160 Wh the device is forbidden from being in either passenger checked or carry-on baggage.

>Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.

I can't find any details on Delta, aside from referring back to TSA. Obviously my concern is someone arbitrarily saying No... which I guess could happen at any time.

Does anyone have experience/knowledge with Delta specifically?"

I am just looking what's the best thing for me to do and some advice on how to proceed on this nightmare that I faced last month. Also, is there any hope to get any percentage of money refunded - either for departure or return tickets.

**Here's the story (sorry it?s long):**
Couple months ago, I bought a round trip ticket for last month from PHL to DEL (New Delhi, India) on Virgin Atlantic last month. The connecting flights were from PHL to JFK (with Delta - partnering with Virgin Atlantic), JFK to LHR (with Virgin Atlantic), and LHR to DEL (Virgin Atlantic). 

This was my first time flying with Virgin Atlantic. And here was my US Visa situation - I had an expired H1-B visa and I was flying to India to get the Visa renewed. Actually, the visa was already renewed by my employer, so I just need a new Visa stamp in an US consulate, which can only be done outside the US. I confirmed with a Virgin Atlantic customer service agent before flying that my Visa situation would not be an issue on the date of flying.

On the date of the flight, the Delta staff at PHL boarded me to JFK. Once I landed in JFK, the Virgin Atlantic staff at the JFK boarding gate refused to board me. They mentioned that I did not have an UK issued transit visa required for me to go through LHR. What bothered me most is that the staff there looked at all of my documents - my passport, current and expired visa documents - and falsely (I will explain why falsely later) claimed that I do not even have the right Visa documents for United States. They said ?You do not have an US Visa or proper documents, you cannot leave this country and fly anywhere?. In reality, I actually did have all the paper work that I needed to leave the country, go to India, get my visa stamped at an US consulate, and then return back. 

I have been in United States for last 14 years, and this was the worst example of customer service I had ever experienced in my life. The staff were extremely rude, condescending, simply refused to help me, or find me another Virgin Atlantic flight that goes through other routes to DEL. 

When I called Virgin Atlantic customer service for further help, the staff on the phone couldn?t also help me with other routes. They had already flew me from PHL to JFK, so now I am stuck in the middle of my journey in an airport far from my home (Philly) without any help from Virgin Atlantic. If this were still in Philly, I could have just driven home and planned  something better. 

I called the customer service again - this time to cancel the remainder of my journey and they said that I needed to pay $200 more to cancel the remaining trip. I asked if I get a travel voucher instead - and they said that would also cost my additional money ($200+ more). When I asked if I can get a refund, they said the tickets are non-refundable and I needed to talk to my travel agent. I put Virgin Atlantic staff and my travel agent representative on a conference call. Essentially, the travel agent mentioned that the money is already processed by Virgin Atlantic, so VA needs to refund it. And Virgin Atlantic staff refused to proceed with any refund.

Finally, I had to purchase another direct flight on a different airlines (United) from a different airport (EWR) which cost me an arm and a leg. The tickets I bought for Virgin Atlantic were simply a waste since I could neither use them nor get any money for refund. 

In addition to all that, Delta lost my checked in luggage when I flew from PHL to JFK and they couldn?t find my bag in JFK airport. It took them more than 10 days to find my bag (well, more like after repeatedly calling them and trying to identify the location of my bag and unable to get any response from them, I simply drove to the airport in DEL, and found my bag lying near their airport counter, unattended).

Given the terrible experience with Virgin Atlantic, I did not take the return flight with them - so those return tickets were also wasted.

The United flight was a direct flight from EWR to DEL - the staff there did not have any issues with my documentations. And in the US Embassy in New Delhi, I got my Visa stamped instantly - the embassy staff there mentioned that I have been in US for long enough and I had all the right documentations for me to get it instantly approved - contradicting Virgin Atlantic boarding gate staff?s theory that I did not have the right US Visa documentations and hence their ground for refusal to board me. 

**tl;dr** - Virgin Atlantic (in partnership with Delta) flew me from PHL to JFK, before refusing to board me at JFK. Then they refused to refund my money and Delta misplaced my baggage for more than a week.

"2019-01-06 02:20:11"|"Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying?"|"Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying:

1. Always check allowed sizes before a flight (they can change). Slightly oversized bags may make it on most flights, but eventually someone at a random gate will tell you it can't go onboard, that it will have to go as checked baggage, and possibly charge you for it (sometimes between transfers).

2. Certain items damaged in checked baggage are not covered under airline policies. You should ALWAYS declare said items if stopped at the gate and either repack to protect it or attempt to work out another arrangement. Never assume personnel saying ""Don't worry, we'll take good care of it"" is enough to place liability on the airline.

3. Despite nobody doing this, ever, READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE you are agreeing to before a flight. Usually when buying a ticket or at the time of check-in is when you agree to abide by said terms.

4. DOT only oversees guidelines for bag damage, not airline excluded items. Items not covered policies are acknowledged as an agreement between airlines and the passengers by terms of service / policies.

5. You may go through the hassle of having to physically file your claim at the airport within 24hrs or less of arrival, fill out a lengthy claim form with proof of purchase and photo evidence, possibly receive a cookie cutter response from corporate that your claim was denied (without providing a channel to explain the scenario that occurred), and realize you may have a low chance of winning a legal battle / wasted most of your time because your bag was just slightly more oversized than the allowed carry-on size you agreed to at the time of ticket purchase or check-in.

6. None of that may even matter because they allow for oversized carry-ons to begin with (or purposely choose to reduce overhead cabin size to increase checked bag sales) reducing available space, leading to (if you're unlucky enough) having your within limits carry-on bag go as checked baggage anyways. But hey, maybe you'll have more legal grounds to protect your items if you still follow reason 2 listed above.

7. Maybe you shouldn't fly anyways because the seats keep getting more cramped, less comfortable, you might get unlucky enough to be placed behind a higher class that can recline their seat into your face, and you could experience the consistent marketing taunt some airlines love to torture you with of how much better your experience could be if you paid them the big bucks (talking about you, Delta).

Side Note: Home insurance doesn't cover travel damage. Always keep receipts for all purchases. Read your product warranties, they usually do not cover physical damage or purchases by 3rd party vendors (which do exist on sites like Amazon).


My questions are:

1. Do you think enough social pressure would ever cause airlines to change their policies to benefit society as a whole versus pursuing lengthy and costly legal battles?

2. Are you going to read all of this or post a comment that says, ""do you seriously expect me to read all of this?"" before realizing I just called you out and delete your post but then possibly re-comment since I called you out again, but ultimately leave it up to chance because I'll end it with saying there's a probably you will either comment or not and suggest you should comment about people needing to read the fine print or terms of service. Or if you didn't realize I did all of this, we should all reply something stupid that seems like it should make sense related to the comment you posted.

3. Will this be reported at first glance for having my questions down at the bottom while riding the grey area of having an airline question along with a warning? If it does get take down, can I assume that this is a fact of life that life's a gamble and I probably will never receive an answer to stated question anyways?

4. Should we be more concerned as citizens that airlines are becoming too consolidated and are [extracted because idk if this language is allowed on this sub-reddit] us over with money grabbing policies, or accept it as a necessary evil to chance having unrestrictive opportunity (from a law perspective, unless lawmakers have money riding on that airline) to fuel the advancement of technology such as tablets on the back of seats? What solutions do you propose would lead to favorable outcomes for us citizens (or specific class level)?

6. Reasons you should check carry-on size limits before flying? (so it's not click bait)"

Alaska will charge $30 for the first checked bag and $40 for the second, in line with new prices at JetBlue, American, Delta and United, according to a new fee chart on its website. JetBlue set $30 and $40 as the new industry benchmark when it hiked its fee in August.

Alaska passenger face a bigger increase in the charge for a second bag than passenger on other airlines because Alaska has been charging $25 for the second checked bag, compared with $35 before the increase as other carriers.

Alaska is also increasing the price for a third checked bag, to $100 from $75. That is still below the $150 fee charged by American, United and delta.

Overpacking will cost Alaska passengers more, too. The airline increased the fee for an overweight bag to $ 100 from $75. All bag fees are each way, per person.

Southwest Airlines are the only U.S. carrier offering free checked bags. Passengers are allowed to check two bags for free. Weight and size limits apply."

I know this depends on some personal characteristics, so here they are: I prefer flying first class but I do not fly a large amount every year. I'd say I fly about .75 to 1.15 round trips per month. so (and I may be wrong) I doubt that FF benefits would be a major concern for me. Basically, I want the best first-class experience for the best price. I have been doing AA paid upgrades but am worried that the airline seems to be at the bottom of most rankings for a lot of things, including service. And, I am wondering if buying Delta first-class fares wouldn't actually be less expensive anyway.

Basically, I don't have enough experience on this but I do want objectively to pick the best airline for me and be loyal to it. Oh, another thing: customer service is very important to me. So, I'm wondering if the FFs can give me the ins and outs."

**Edits**

A related article from CNN which includes this interesting tidbit (kudos to /u/dubbltrubbl/ 


> While the deal at its outset is a three-way tie up, the legalese of the deal's announcement allows Bombardier and Quebec to exit the program in 2023, selling their stakes to Airbus in the years to come.
""At the end of the day, this is going to be an Airbus program,"" said Rainer Ohler, vice president of communications for Airbus Group in an interview. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018.> 

http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/16/news/companies/airbus-buys-majority-stake-bombardier-cseries/index.html

and a comment from Boeing

> ""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government. Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,"" a Boeing spokesman said in a statement.> 

So based on everything this is basically an almost no risk steal for Airbus; and while they tried sorting out a deal a while back it seems now that the thing is flying and proving to pan out they were interested again.


There is also a bit more detail in this Globe & Mail article (note: paywall) but I've highlighted one item below I didn't see anywhere; also corrected a mistake in the article:

> Bombardier will continue to fund the plane's early production through the limited partnership as well as any cash shortfalls up to $700-million over the first three years of the deal. ~~Boeing~~ ***Airbus*** also obtains warrants for 100 million subordinate voting shares in C Series parent Bombardier Inc. and the right to buy Bombardier's stake in the partnership at a later date

He started off by telling me that flight school is really expensive (he went to embry riddle). He also told me before becoming a pilot you have to see if you like flying in general and to try flying with a flight instructor for like $100 solo. Tbh I RARELY see women who are pilots these days and I was wondering why that is & how hard it is to become one in general. I also worry a lot about my future if I become a pilot. Here are some questions I have:

1. Will I get to spend time with my family? 
2. How long will it take me until I start flying commercial? 
3. How can I raise my kids if I?m gonna be gone? 
4. Will I get super lonely on trips?  
5. Do you need a bachelors degree to go to flight school? 
6. Is flight school stressful & hard?
7. Is it true that women in aviation move up the ladder quickly? 
8. Is it too late to start wanting to become a pilot? 

If anyone could answer some of my questions, that would be great! Even if you could only answer one question, I still would appreciate any input if you know anything about women in aviation or have more information about this. I know some people my age who are already completing their private pilots license, but I have no $ or experience whatsoever :("

"2012-01-22 20:36:58"|"I'm petrified of flying. Just wondering if r/aviation can help me out."|"Hey guys, I have a pretty debilitating fear of flying, but do it often for work. Last year I flew 48 times in 52 weeks and only one of them was a good flight (I sat next to an off-duty Delta pilot and we talked the whole time about how safe flying is). 

I've tried everything to help. Sleep meds don't help. Self-help books don't help. My mother saying, ""you know, flying is much safer than driving!"" doesn't help. 

I know it's an irrational fear. And obviously I don't let it keep it keep me from living life, but man I'd like to enjoy it. I'm just a complete wreck (inwardly. I don't freak out and cause a scene.) Takeoff is the worst.

My fears are probably based on a slight fear of heights, claustrophobia, and not being in control (you know... like sitting in the back seat of a car and wanting to push the brakes when you see the car in front of you slow down). 

One thing I constantly do is worry that an engine is just going to blow up because it's so gosh damn powerful and spinning like mad. Seriously... their power scares the hell out of me. 

Not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just some calming anecdotes from you pilots. One thing that does calm me down a lot is watching cockpit videos and seeing how normal and relaxed the pilots are. It really is ultra-safe. 

Also... eff turbulence.

Thanks guys."

"2018-09-14 17:36:14"|"""What's the matter with ATL?"""|"ATL has some of the highest international fares of any major U.S. city, and its domestic routes are also incredibly expensive. In the airport, low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier are punished with horrible gates at the end of the airport's poorly designed concourses. If the city of Atlanta really cared about its citizens, it wouldn't let Delta dominate this major airport like a fiefdom. If Delta left Atlanta, so what? ATL would still be a decent facility and fares would plummet as low-cost airlines occupied former gates dominated by Delta. 

&#x200B;

Sure, Delta provides a few jobs for Atlanta residents, but it mostly just dominates ATL -- in a grossly corrupt way (look at the way Qatar was treated) -- and punishes everyone who doesn't work for Delta with insane airfares. And given Atlanta is really in the middle of nowhere, with no rail connections, the only option people living there have is to fly. "

I am seriously thinking about becoming a pilot, and am looking to getting my commercial pilots license. I am a bit nervous as this is the next big step of my life, and hoping you guys can answer a couple of questions. 

1. First off, is this is a good time to get a job as a pilot? I will graduate from college in june 2015, and enroll in flying school right after I graduate, and expect get my license by 2016, how is the job outlook looking?. Is the job market horrible? or is projected to get better? 

2. Realistically, after I graduate from college, and full time focus just on getting my license, how soon can I expect to get my license, and enter the job market? I understand that one can has to get the cpl license and the atp license and then only can enter the job market right?. 

3. Are flying for commercial airlines like Southwest, and Delta one of the most sough after options. Are there any other options that are very good, but are not sought after. Are flying commerical airlines sought after, because they are lucrative? 

4. And finally, I understand flying school is really expensive. But, as its my passion, I am willing to go through it, even though it will be financial burden. My family is very poor, and thus cannot be of much help. So, I would be looking at taking out loans for the whole process. How much realistically can I expect the total loans would be for the whole process- from getting my license  to enter the job market. 

Also, any reccomendations for flying schools in Orange County, California, as it would be the most convenient here. Thank you so much guys!, and you guys have no idea how grateful I would be be if you guys help me here. I really appreciate it!. "

Today, August 2nd, marks 30 years since the crash of Delta Air Lines 191, FLL-DFW. The aircraft, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar (reg. N276DA), was carrying 163 people (152 passengers, 11 crew). Flight 191 crashed just short of runway 17L due to windshear resulting from a [microburst](http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/tstorms_article_img3.jpg). 

The aircraft touched down nearly 2 miles ahead of 17L and skidded along the ground. Flight 191 lifted up once more, before falling right back down. The TriStar careened through State Highway 114, impacting a vehicle with its left engine, before finally colliding into two water tanks. The front and center sections of the aircraft exploded into flames as the tail section, now separated, slid along the ground. 

134 occupants perished, along with the occupant of the car on Hwy 114. Nearly all survivors were located in the tail section.

Due to this crash, we made huge advancements in windshear detection technology and subsequently saw widespread adoption of Dopplar radar at airports.

Basically everything I'm reading indicates CSR is the better overall package with easy to use perks and points that go farther. I just got the ink too so those will work together well.

But, I have a couple of big trips firing off in December and do plan on travelling a decent amount the next year (potential trip to Asia and a small handful of domestic trips using companion pass). My home airport is SJC but I will occasionally be flying out of SFO, especially for international.

I use Uber monthly and know how to squeeze the $400 out of the airline credit (the once every calendar year still applies correct?), so I'm not concerned about getting back the AF. It mostly comes down to benefits for me. 

The centurion Lounges are really, really appealing to me, and I think it might be especially nice for my first big international trip to London into the new year to make it a little more special. Whenever I do fly home it also does tend to be Delta, so getting lounge access there is appealing too. I also like (and have used before with gold) the free roadside assistance.

However CSR isn't going to have a nerfed priority pass and gives true primary rental insurance and trip insurance. I don't rent cars often but I am planning to for my London trip. Plus it's easier to just get hard value out of the AF and points. It seems silly to want the platinum just for Centurion, since overall CSR would be the better card, right? But a solid lounge experience is something I actually would like and I do have access to centurion from my local airport and airports I often travel to/from when visiting friends/family.

"2018-08-08 18:30:16"|"Award Travel: The bottleneck of churning, a rant after a year of non-stop traveling on points"|"The following is a reflection of my frustration with award travel prompted by aksurvivorfan?s post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/8xcnaa/discussion_frustrations_with_the_act_of_churning/) on their frustration with churning. Seeing as churning and award travel go hand-in-hand, this is also a word of warning for savy churners looking to transition into the next phase that is award travel. It?s not safe to assume the same success. The process of award travel is much more difficult.

My one year of traveling has come to a close. I haven?t traveled nearly as much as those who do it full-time, but I have spent more than two million miles on flights since 2017. This post is a reflection of some of the frustrations of the miles and points game that are often forgotten and omitted in posts on reddit and in the blogosphere. I went from being an avid fanatic of the hobby with barely any reservations to a huge critic of the many overlooked obstacles of award travel, especially the golden goose that is premium cabins that many, but not all of us, chase. After all, it was the first and business class redemptions rather than mileage currencies itself that got me and most of the people I know interested.

TL:DR: While churning and amassing a huge amount of points is relatively simple and straightforward (give or take the current rules in place and possible future restrictions), maximizing award travel can be quite the opposite, sometimes extremely time consuming and difficult to navigate.

I was introduced to the hobby in 2014 when, out of curiosity, I started looking up first class reviews. I stumbled across the blog, One Mile at a Time, and was blown away on how someone not much older than me was consistently traveling on first class tickets without travel benefits and little out-of-pocket expense. I finally was able to get my first ?true? churning card in 2015 and since then have opened up several accounts.

But being both a full-time student and employee, meant that I had almost no time to travel. And when I did have time off, it was at most a week, two if I was lucky. This meant long haul travel was often out of the picture due to time lost in transit which brings me to frustration point #1:

1. You need time to travel.

Now I know most of you already know this as it?s nothing new. However, many of my friends who started with me in this hobby in 2015 are still sitting on the same treasure chest of points with a few redemptions but nothing significant enough to make a sizeable dent in their balance. The biggest constraint for them and many others was finding leave, which tends to be the reason why most people don?t want to do round the world awards that otherwise are one of the best bargains for miles in the business. My solution this past year was to no longer stay a full-time student and employee, which being young and without a family was an easier choice to make than most. But say you are able to find the time to travel, then you soon come to realize the next frustration point.

2.	Finding availability isn?t as easy with miles as with cash.

And this point here, tends to be a real deal breaker, especially if your time off often correlates to holidays when everyone else is off such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year?s. Or if it?s off-peak, but on an airline that only releases one business seat to partners (ie: Korean Air). Or there?s availability, but only far enough in advance (ie: Qantas or Air New Zealand), but too early enough to guarantee you?ll be authorized leave. Or like Cathay or Lufthansa First, where it requires you to be flexible enough to plan a week or two before your trip. Sometimes the airline is just plain stingy and doesn?t like to release award seats (IE: American Airlines on domestic routes). Another catch is that airlines don?t apply the same supply and demand algorithms to award availability that they do to the usual cash seats. Only a handful of award seats are allocated and then are released and restricted at varying times as you get closer to departure. Maybe it?s an oversimplification, but it?s usually an all or nothing type of ordeal. It goes from saver awards, to unaffordable standard awards, to no availability. Sometimes even in the reverse order.  It?s usually not the gradual change in pricing that you typically see with cash tickets.  Don?t even get me started on trying to find premium availability for parties greater than two. Sometimes you even have to find availability using another airline?s website (British Airways search using American Airlines), or there?s phantom availability, availability not searchable online (Alaska for Cathay), married segment availability (Qatar), and the list goes on and on. But say, you find the availability but as you?re piecing everything together online, an error message pops up. You call the airline up, feed the flights, only to find out your trip is significantly more expensive than expected or that the routing isn?t valid. Here we have frustration point #3.

3.	Your routing isn?t always valid even if it?s logical.

Oh boy does this require TONS of time and research. Especially if you?re trying to go for the real niche redemptions that can save you a bunch of miles. You have so many airline programs accessible with transferable currencies, multiplied by the amount of partners for each airline, and then some. This of course assumes that the airlines actually publish these rules yet alone follows them. Take for example the ninth circle of award redemption hell that is SkyTeam, save for Korean Air. The two most popular members, being Air France/KLM and Delta. Neither publish award charts to add to their already poor search engines. So you get awards that price out contrary to logic (IE: JFK-CDG-ZRH might be cheaper than JFK-CDG). My personal pet peeve is the maximum permitted mileage restriction since many of my routings to Europe require back-tracking by necessity not by choice. American likes to segment cap awards which really punishes those in small airports or prevents routing through third regions with certain exceptions. This is where United really shines, even with the introduction of the Excursionist perk/restriction, MileagePlus is still the most generous among the big three in terms of routing rules. I spent almost every day this past year researching on this topic, and every time I think I come close to mastering a program, I find something new or a program change renders some of my past knowledge obsolete. Say you cross all your t?s and dot all your I?s on your upcoming Etihad first itinerary. You find the time to travel, find the availability, and verify the cost and route validity. You can call American only to find out that they can?t book it nor find the availability. Thus, frustration point #4 is often overlooked.

4.	Booking awards isn?t always straightforward

The example above is caused by US based American Airlines agents being unable to see Etihad first availability, whereas certain call centers like Australia and New Zealand are able to find and book your request. But sometimes it?s not even technical issues like that. YMMV even with the CS reps themselves, especially with one of the off the beaten track currencies like Turkish. One of the top posts on r/awardtravel outlines the process in booking a second first class JAL award seat and it?s a great example of frustration points #2 and #4. It?s great to see how some of the top posts in award travel help breakdown these processes in simple and easy to follow steps to make frustration point #4 much more straightforward. It doesn?t help that airlines love to tack on fees during the booking process: fees for booking close to departure, booking over the phone, booking on partners, etc. In the end, all these fees (sometimes avoidable, not always) make award travel not as free as it?s hyped up to be. I?m sure you can figure out our next frustration point, since people love to advertise award travel as free travel.

5.	Award travel isn?t free and neither are miles.

There are tons of clickbait titles and misleading propaganda on blogosphere and especially YouTube vlogs about how they scored a $XXXXX flight for $5 as the main point rather than the amount of miles used to book the flight. Miles are definitely not free and even if someone offered to cash out my entire point balance at a generous 2 cents per point, I?d still feel short changed. There?s so many rules in regards to taxes and fees yet sometimes the only way you find out is at the final step of the booking process. Taxes and fees vary depending on the currencies used and the airlines redeemed and navigating these can be a huge headache. So while I can redeem 230K United Airlines miles for a roundtrip between HND-FRA in ANA first class for ?only? $120, most people would agree that 93K AMEX points with a 30% transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic with $375 in surcharges is a much better redemption. So no, one doesn?t redeem first class ANA for just ?$120?. Props if you?ve read this far, as we?ve finally reached the final frustration point.

6.	Information on award travel is not as readily blogged as churning information or trip reports.

I think it?s a shame that there?s more focus on how to accrue points than on how to spend them. At first, this confused me, especially when the latter is much more difficult. What?s the point of churning if you can?t reap the rewards effectively? The cold truth is that blogs and referrals receive commissions on the amount of credit card sign ups, not the amount of award redemptions. In fact, many blogs also profit by offering award booking services so having everyone informed, would be a loss of another revenue stream. I only started browsing flyertalk once I needed information for award redemptions since information on churning is readily available, at times over saturated. For example, there are tons of posts advertising IHG credit cards and how Intercontinental Thalasso is a great redemption of IHG points! $1,000 vs 70K IHG points, 1+ cpp! But there are almost no posts anywhere regarding how to successfully book award nights, even on flyertalk where it becomes obvious it?s a closely guarded secret. There?s a huge discrepancy of information between r/churning and r/awardtravel, and while I think doctorofcredit is the best resource for churning, there?s clearly not as much information on the website for award travel.

In the end, award travel may not be as much of a glorified hobby compared to churning due to its difficulty, but it?s definitely just as important. In fact, I still hesitate pitching churning to certain people who can easily accrue points and succeed in the hobby, but don?t know anything about award travel. There?s little use in collecting a huge sum of points yet unable to redeem them, only for them to be devalued year after year.

I know it might seem like I'm just a cynic and anti-award travel, but I certainly still support this hobby just hopefully with a little more research and awareness from current and upcoming churners.

"2016-06-16 23:32:27"|"The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend"|"##The 3 Card Las Vegas Weekend
June 16, 2016

I wanted to share a Las Vegas long weekend trip I just booked when the opportunity came up.  This is something most people can do with a bit of planning and time.  I structured the write-up around a single churner applying for 3 cards.  If you are churning for two, the same trip can be done more efficiently with 4 cards.  You do have to hold one of the cards for more than 1 year, and pay a $49 annual fee.

### The Cards involved

- Chase Sapphire Preferred/Chase British Airways (30K UR/Avios)
- AmEx Starwood Preferred (20K SPG Starpoints)
- Chase IHG (60k IHG AND 1 Annual Free Night after 1 year)

### Booking the Trip

The genesis of the trip was a SPG Moments offer: for 20K SPG points, you can get premium seats for two at a concert at Caesar?s Palace.  This was something we were looking to do over the summer, so having it pop-up was perfect.  It?s unclear what ?Premium? seats mean, but decent seats for the concert runs $2-300 per ticket.  So the 20K SPG points is redeeming for something between $4-600 in value.  Flyertalk search showed one report of the seats being in the 8th row, which would indeed be pretty good seats.

**UPDATE** SPG has gotten back to me with the seats.  They are in the orchestra section, and tickets for that section are going for $430 a piece.  So the 20K SPG points bought $860 worth of tickets. 

Las Vegas hotels discounts heavily on a regular basis, so folks often find the best value by just booking a discount rate.  When I started looking at hotels, I start with awardmapper.com.  None of the rates really looked appealing, but as I looked deeper, the Venetian and Palazzo are Intercontinentals, and award nights is priced at 60K.  This means that 2 nights there would be 60K IHG points for the first night, and an annual free night certificate (second night) if you hold the IHG card for a year and pay the $49 AF.  The better plan would be using two annual free night certificates, which I happen to have available.  Booking this was very easy, just login into your IHG account, and use the Book Free Night functionality.  When I looked, the rate per night is $300 at the Palazzo.  So signing up for the IHG card, paying the AF of $49 for the second year, will redeem for a value around $600.  Note, even if the hotel discounts 50%, you are still looking at a $300 redemption.  BTW, I found out afterwards that the hotels are all suites, with 720 sq ft in their standard rooms.  There is a $32 per night Resort fee that needs to be paid on award stays as well, but rumour is that there is a way to get out of it.  Reports also show that IHG Platinum and Spire Elites status means little to nothing at these hotels, so don?t expect an upgrade based on these statuses.  Royal Ambassador does get the expected recognition.

Last step, how to get to Las Vegas.  From Seattle to Las Vegas is just under 1,000 miles, which means if I redeemed Avios from a Chase BA card, or transfer points from UR to Avios, I would spend 30K points for two RTs.  To book, I would use AA.com, and search for awards costing 12.5K AA miles.  I can find award flights on Alaska Air at that redemption cost for both days, and write down the flight numbers.  I would then call BA directly, and booked these flights, as you cannot book Alaska awards on BA.com.  I did all these searches, and seats were available, but the timing of the return flight was atrocious, something to be aware of when looking at award flights.

Note that I describe how it can be done with a CSP or BA Avios card.  In my case, I chose to save my points.  The actual flights at more preferred times on this trip cost about $200 per person.  I also have an Alaska Air companion pass from the Alaska Air card, which makes the 2 RTs cost around $340.  As I value 30K of Avios/UR more than $340, I decided it was more valuable for me to save the points and pay for the flights.  This is purely a personal decision, and only you can decide whether paying for the flights, or using points is a better deal.

Now, what if Alaska air is not a useful redemption from where you live?  The Chase UR points can be transferred to United or Flying Blue, and you can redeem United or Delta award flights.  If your preferred airline is Southwest, then a Chase Southwest card with the 50K sign-up bonus, would very likely get two of you to Vegas with 1 card.  If you get the Companion Pass, it would further halve the cost.

### Takeaways

First of all, this is a pretty simple redemption.  Other than the BA award, you can do everything online.  Secondly, with just 3 cards, you can get a nice little weekend getaway without having to worry about MS or other complexities, and you will likely have some points leftover.  The only gotcha is that you need to get the IHG card, and hold it for a year to get the free annual night.  The ability to redeem at almost all IHG properties make the $49 AF an absolute bargain if you plan any IHG hotel stays over the course of a year.

Next, SPG Moments offer a different dimension on how to use points.  Other than just free nights or airline tickets, you can get some pretty interesting redemptions, such as boxed seats to sporting events, concerts tickets, or even mingling with players at a ball park.  This alone is a pretty good reason to keep on channeling un-bonused spend onto the AmEx SPG card.

Lastly, point valuation is very personal.  Some folks value getting as many free trips as possible, while some may see points as opening doors to premium travel that you wouldn?t really want to pay for in cash.  There is no right answer here.  Whatever works for you, is the best answer.

We got a little of everything in this itinerary from a redemption standpoint: ANA RTW, a ridiculous redemption through the Chase portal, a three-night stay at everyone?s favorite RC Kyoto at the discounted rate, and some questionable single leg bookings. Please read about the process below before commenting on how dumb I was with some of these redemptions :)

**Step One: Planning the Redemptions and Utilizing Marriott?s Hotel + Air Redemption**

Planning how to make this trip possible seemed to change about every other week. As mentioned, this was our first time doing something like this, so I was learning as I was planning. Based on what points and miles we had collected (and what we planned to collect), I planned on the following: Marriott bookings for Tokyo and Kyoto, Chase UR for either Santorini or the Maldives and cash for the other, and a mixture of redemptions through United, Singapore, and/or Turkish of varying classes for the flights (I hadn?t really planned Osaka, Hiroshima, or Miyajima at this point since they were all one night stays). I used the Marriott Hotel + Air package available before the merger to book seven nights in Tokyo and transfer 120k miles to United. At some point (thanks to this subreddit!) I learned about ANA Round the World. We would save a ton of miles and fly biz class across the board at the same time! Unfortunately, there were less than nine months until the trip, and we had essentially nothing in MR. 

**Step Two: Booking the Main Hotel Stays**

While we worked on churning MR for the RTW tickets, I focused on booking our hotel stays. As mentioned, I used the Hotel + Air package for seven nights in Tokyo, and Kyoto was easy enough to figure out; with the category 8 redemption cost not taking effect until March 2019, three nights at the Ritz Carlton at 60k per night was a no brainer. 

My original plan was to stay in Santorini using Chase UR (as they do not really have any big international chains on the island) and use cash to pay for our nights in the Maldives at whatever resort we preferred. I never really considered Hilton points for the Conrad, as we didn?t have time to churn through those cards while prioritizing MR for the RTW tickets. After some research, we decided on Canaves Oia Suites for Santorini and either Huvafen Fushi or Anantara Kivanah for the Maldives. Back before the Chase portal change to be straight up Expedia, though, the hotel we wanted for Santorini wasn?t available, so this got swapped around. We had enough Chase points to cover four nights in the larger (and more expensive) overwater ocean bungalows at HF, and I read on Trip Advisor they have one of if not the best reefs for snorkeling in the Maldives, so I booked both of these using cash and a ton of Chase UR respectively. I know some of you may gawk at using so much UR for four nights, but staying in our number one choice is worth it for us. Churn and burn!
After all that, we did have some Hilton points sitting around that would cover a night in Osaka, but our Marriott points were depleted by the time I got around to Hiroshima and Miyajima. We wanted to try a night at a ryokan for Miyajima anyways, so I used our remaining Chase points for both of these.

**Step Three: Making ANA RTW Work**

Three Amex cards later, we finally had enough MR for two business class ANA RTW tickets. Unfortunately, it was December by the time all the bonuses had posted, and some previous availability had dried up while our dates were more or less set in stone (I really did not want to rework the entire itinerary at this point or bother with rebooking our hotels for different dates). By focusing on TAP Portugal, I was able to find some overseas flights to Europe in J for the first leg, and the last leg from Tokyo to the US wasn?t too hard to find; there were a handful of Asiana options, but I found a United flight with the new 1-2-1 Polaris layout and went with that. The difficult legs were to and from the Maldives. Getting from Male to Osaka wasn?t too difficult, just kinda wonky, but I couldn?t find anything for the inbound leg from Athens. Ultimately, I said screw it and used our AA miles (which aren?t hard to come by anyways) to get from ATH to DOH to MLE on Qatar. It cost 85k miles and little in surcharges but saved us 40k ANA miles and whatever the surcharges would?ve been, so it wasn?t a huge loss. Plus, the additional 45k miles may be worth it for Qatar; their J class looks awesome! I?m excited for our second leg, as it?s the QSuites product. 

You?ll notice from our itinerary, though, inbound and output flights for both Birmingham and Santorini were not included as well as MLE to BLR. As for BHM, there just wasn?t much availability that fit our schedule (as we had to depart Thursday night after work and return the Monday we left Tokyo; Denver was as far as we could get on the return trip). There were some options from Athens to Santorini and vice versa, but the flights were either really early or really late and included about $50 in surcharges per person per flight. Since flights to and from Santorini are cheap anyways, I decided using alternative means would provide more flexibility to enjoy our three night stay. MLE to BLR was supposed to be part of our RTW itinerary, as it was available when I pieced it together on the phone with the ANA agent, but when I called back a few days later to finalize the booking after the points had transferred, Air India flights were no longer available via ANA for some reason, so I covered it with United miles.

**Step Four: Filling in the Gaps**

After the RTW tickets were booked, here?s what was left: getting from BHM to EWR, a hotel stay in Newark, a hotel stay in Athens, getting from Athens to Santorini and back, and getting from Denver to BHM. We had just enough Hilton points to cover a stay near the airport in Newark, so that was taken care of right off the bat. My CSR travel credit posted sometime in February, so I used that for the stay at the hotel near Athens airport; there were cheaper options, but it was convenient and would ensure we could get to bed as quickly as possible off our flight and sleep in a bit if possible to help with jet lag. We also faced spending the night in Doha airport, and even though it wasn?t really necessary, we decided to use my remaining CSR credit and cash to cover a stay at the airport hotel to ensure we would be as rested as we could be on our way to the Maldives. Given it was our honeymoon and we still had money set aside for flights and hotels, we put aside the idea of maximizing value or saving a few hundred more dollars to prioritize convenience and rest. 

All that was left at this point were those remaining legs. This is where I messed up. I had that extra 120k United miles sitting around from the Hotel + Air package, and I was eager to put this all to bed. There was only one option from Denver to Birmingham via United miles anyways, so I forked over 22k a piece to get home. I had used all our Amex airline credits for AA gift cards to get us to NYC, but I did not factor in that the AA flights available did not fly into EWR and we?d be landing late at night. I didn?t want to deal with trying to get to Newark at 1 AM, so I changed plans and transferred Amex to Delta so we could land there and go straight to the hotel (I wanted us to hit the bed as early as possible to try to adjust for the upcoming time difference by waking up early). I went ahead and booked us seats in Comfort+ because why not, it wasn?t that many extra miles and I?m tall, and now I have a bunch of AA gift cards. 

Meanwhile, I kept checking on flights to and from Santorini. I prioritized Olympic, as we?d have two heavy pieces of luggage to check and the budget airlines would bleed us dry after that was factored in. I wanted early afternoon flights for both trips, but all flights around that time were $150 per person. There was an outbound flight available that could be booked via United miles for 8k per person and fees, though, so I went ahead and booked that. Nothing good was available for the inbound trip, so I checked every day for a month until prices dropped. I finally got one for $131 total that included checked luggage, which was great! But then I checked on the outbound flight, and it had also dropped in price to $45 per person, meaning I spent 16k miles and fees for what would?ve been $90. I checked the DEN to BHM flight as well, and it had also decreased in cost both for cash and points. So that whole ordeal was a waste of United miles, but at least it was all small scale and everything was booked.  

**Final Notes**

Congrats if you made it this far! I tried to be as succinct as possible, but there was a lot going on with this itinerary. Some of the redemptions weren't the best, and we could've gotten a lot more value for our points in the long haul if we didn't go absolutely bonkers with it, but I know that we are going to have the trip of a lifetime! In retrospect, given the limited time frame (all the churning happened in less than two years), there's not much I would change. I definitely would have prioritized the ANA RTW tickets first to improve what legs were available, and I'd want a do-over on booking those small legs at the end, but that's about it really! **A huge thanks to this sub for helping make this possible!** I have no idea what this trip would've been without all the advice and information I got from here.

EDIT: Forgot to include this in the original post, but we'll be staying 3 nights in Santorini, 4 nights in the Maldives, and 13 nights in Japan, with one night stops in Newark, Athens, and Doha between flights. We'll be gone for 25 days total including flights. 

EDIT 2: Adjusted redemption table for the DEN -> BHM leg to reflect the price decrease I mentioned; $750 was the price at the time of booking, it has since gone down."

Feb 9 2019

There are tons of videos and trip reports out there, reporting how someone got a great award ticket in awesome FIRST CLASS!  Everyday on this sub, we have people come in and say ?Hey, I have xxxK UR points, Now what??

This post is meant to be an Intro Guide to Award Booking, focusing on using Miles and Points to book awards outside of the various travel portals.  The intent is not to show you how to book all awards, but understand the basic anatomy of an award booking so you can begin to know what questions you need to ask and answer.

#The Basics

This section is important, as you need to understand the various parties involved in an award booking.

##Frequent Flyer Program

This is the actual FF program, typically operated by a specific Airline.  Most program tracks a FF balance using the term Miles.  For example, a member of the program can have nnn Miles.  Note that some programs name their Currency Points or other names, but for simplicity, we will refer to all of them as Miles.  Some basic rules that applies to most FF Programs are:  Miles are not transferable to other FF programs, so if you have AA Miles, they will always be AA miles.  Miles can expire based on each program?s terms and conditions.  Miles can only be used to redeem awards based on that program?s award chart and rules.  You cannot join Miles from different FF programs to book an award.

Note, joining FF programs are usually, if not always, free.  Just visit the Airline?s website and sign-up, providing your information and creating an account.  **Note, when signing up to a FF program, always use your full and accurate name as identified on your Passport.**  If you leave out your middle name, or use an abbreviation or alias, you may run into issue when you try to book and use award tickets.

##Frequent Flyer Program Rules

Each Program has rules.  The rules define the following:

- How many Miles you can accrue when you purchase a ticket.
- How can you earn Status in the program.
- Can Miles be freely shared between 2 program members.  The answer is most oftenly No, but some programs such as BA Avios, ANA, and JetBlue offer family pooling features for free.
- What are the expiration rules surrounding the Miles.  A key point to understand is that Most if not ALL programs believe they own the Miles.  You are not the legal owner of any Miles.  So the program has maximum freedom in defining how and if you can use them, or when you will lose them.  Some programs will expire Miles so many months after earning them.  Other programs will extend them based on certain conditions being met.
- How many Miles does it cost to redeem an award, most oftenly covered in an Award Chart.  Certain programs such as JetBlue or Southwest roughly translates Miles to a fixed monetary value for redemption.  Delta has decided that they will price award seats at whatever level they feel is right, so you won?t find an award chart for Delta.
- How much does it cost to redeem an award on partner airlines.  Most oftenly covered in a Partner Award Chart.  Some airlines such as Alaska has a separate award chart for each partner.
- Can you book one-way award flights, or are you required to book Round Trip?
- What are the fees associated with booking an award.  For example, are there close in booking fees?  Does the airline impose additional fees and surcharges on award bookings?  Does the program pass along Fuel Surcharges from partner airlines?
- What are the rules surrounding stopovers, layovers, or open jaw.  Basically, how you can take advantage of a ticket to visit the most cities possible.
- What are the rules and costs around changing or cancelling an award.
- Who can be a passenger.  Certain airlines such as ANA and Korean Air only allow booking awards for direct relatives.  Enforcement is specific to each airline with such rules, but don?t expect you can book an award for your BFF on any airline without reading up the rules.
- How far out you can book a ticket, and how long is the ticket good for. Almost all airlines limit award ticket travel to maximum of 1 year out.
- Can an award ticket contain segments of travel served by multiple partner airlines?

##Airline Alliances

Airline Alliances are partnerships, created to provide a connected experiences for customers traveling outside the operational area of a particular airline.  So when a customer purchases a ticket, the ticket may span flights operated by multiple airlines of an Alliance.  The luggage may be through-checked through the final destination (foreign travels usually require luggage to be retrieved and examined at Port of entry), and your FF status is observed across the Alliance.  For example, you may want to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, stop for a week, then fly to Hong Kong.  You may find that on that ticket you bought from AA that the first segment, LAX-NRT, is on a flight operated by AA (Referred to as AA Metal).  But the next segment, NRT-HKG, is on Cathay Pacific Metal, even though you are still on an AA ticket.

There are 3 major Alliances that many airlines belongs to: One World, Star Alliance, and Sky Team.  There are some airlines such as Alaska that has direct partnership with a number of airlines, but does not belong to any of the 3 main alliances.  Some of these unique alliances often create excellent value for award seekers.

When dealing with Award Tickets, the common misconception is that you can transfer Miles between Partners.  Miles in a particular FF Program cannot be transferred to Miles in a different Program (with very specific exceptions, such as BA and Iberia,owned by the same parent company).  However, through the use of Partner Award charts, you can use your miles to book flights operated by other Airlines.  For example, your Korean SkyPass Miles cannot be transferred to Delta.  However, you CAN book KE award tickets on Delta operated flights using your KE Miles.  The cost would be based on KE?s partner award chart, and the availability will depend on whether Delta makes any award seats available to KE.  Note that airlines often make more award seats available to their own FF members than partners.

A couple of terms here you need to be familiar are:  Ticketing Airline is the airline that you redeemed an award.  So if you used AA miles to redeem an award with AA, AA is the ticketing airline.  Operating Airline is the airline that actually flies you from point A to B.  Each award ticket has a Ticketing Airline, and one or more Operating Airline.  Note that prior to day of travel, any issues or changes must be done though the Ticketing airline.  On the day of travel, the Operating airline has control of the ticket, in order to deal with operational issues.  

Since each program has different award charts and costs, this leads to the ability to arbitrage, provided you can earn enough Miles in a particular program.  As a matter of fact, it maybe cheaper, relatively speaking, to book a flight not using the operating airline FF miles, but use a partner Miles since that award chart has a lower cost.

##Transferable Points

A number of credit card companies, and one specific Hotel, allows you to transfer their points to Airline FF programs.  This ability offers the freedom to hold points in a convertible currency, rather than in a specific FF program.  These programs include the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (UR), American Express Membership Rewards Points (MR), Citibank ThankYou Points (TYP), Capital One Venture Miles, and Marriott Bonvoy Points.  Note that each of these program can only transfer to a limited selection airlines and hotel programs.  For example, UR?s cannot be transferred to ANA, and only Marriott can transfer to AA.  This information becomes important as if you want to save up Points for a redemption, you need to know if the points can transfer to your desired program.

I will be putting together separate articles on each of the transferable points, and their partners.

##Class of Service

Let?s be honest, many people get into award tickets because the price of airline travel is a significant chunk of change.  Furthermore, ever want to fly in those comfortable Business or First class seats?

If you ever try to book a premium class ticket, especially on international routes, you will find that a Business Class ticket can cost 5 to 10 times more than an Economy Class ticket.  A first class Round trip to Japan is $20,000, but an Economy ticket can be easily under $1000.  Where this gets interesting, is that if you look at an award chart, a First Class award ticket would only cost 2-3x more than a Economy award ticket.  This is why a lot of people uses Miles to book premium awards.

Some common lingo on Class of Service:

- Y: Economy Class
- PE: Premium Economy
- J: Business 
- F: First 

##Upgrading a paid ticket with Miles

People often ask whether they can upgrade a paid seat to a higher class of service.  Programs such as United allows these types of upgrades.  However, almost all such programs requires the original paid ticket to be the most un-restricted (i.e. Expensive) ticket of that class.  For example, EVA allows you to upgrade from Y to J, but the Y ticket must be a full fare ticket.  Often times, the full fare Y ticket is almost as expensive as buying a J ticket on sale, and most people don?t buy those tickets unless work is buying them last minute.

So yes, there is often a way to upgrade a Y ticket, but if you bought the Y ticket on the cheap, the upgrade would not be allowed.  In addition, the operating airline must also make such upgrade award seats available.

##Types of Award Ticket

In addition to Class of service, some airlines also offer different types of award tickets.  While airlines may name them differently, the most common ones are ?Savers? awards, and ?Anytime? awards.  

?Savers? are the cheapest award tickets in terms of points, and airlines will release only a certain number of these seats.  Once these awards are gone, the airline is unlikely to release more.  Usually, some or all of the Savers are released to partner airlines.  So if you are hoping to use a partner program to book award seats, the operating airline must make Savers available first.  Since not all Savers seat are bookable by partners as operating airline may reserve certain number of them for their own members, you may be forced to pay a higher cost and use an airline?s own Miles, rather than rely on a lower cost on a partner airline award cost.

?Anytime? are awards airlines make available to their own program members.  Anytime awards are not dependent on award seats being made available, but can be redeemed anytime.  As expected, these awards are usually much more expensive than Savers in terms of Miles, but offers the ability to get the last available seat on a flight.  Anytime awards are not made available to partners, so when you are search partner awards, you need to make sure the availability you found are not Anytime awards.

#Planning to Book an Award

After all that, I?m about to take you through the steps in booking an award ticket.  Note that this is not on purposely confusing, but it is a reflection of booking awards is not easy.

##Origination and Destination(s)

First of all, you need to be sure where you are flying from, and where you want to fly.  This actually is not so straight forward.

If you live near a large city with a well served airport, then where you flying from could be straight forward.  However, if you live near a smaller airport, you will have to deal with connections and layovers/transfers.  When buying a ticket, you often just see the repositioning flight priced into the ticket.

When dealing with an award ticket, all bets are off.  Let say you are in Reno, and you want to fly to Hong Kong on Cathay?s wonderful F product.  You do your foot work, and find the award seat available on the date you want to travel.  Unfortunately, you need to catch that CX flight in Los Angeles, and there are no Reno to LAX award seats available on AA or AS.  You now have to choose:  You can hope that CX F award seat remains available until AS/AA opens up a Savers award seat, or you can buy another ticket to reposition yourself to LAX in order to catch the CX flight.  

There are certain awards, such as using Virgin Atlantic Miles to fly ANA F, that cannot have a repositioning flight.  So unless you reside near an airport that ANA flies to directly, you are stuck with buying a repositioning flight.

As for Destination, it?s easy when you are visiting one place and then return.  It?s more complicated if you want to visit 2 or more countries on that trip.  You need to study up whether the FF program allows Stopovers, or Open JAW, or offer something like United?s excursion perk, in order for you to visit as many places as possible on one award ticket.

##Dates

The dates you wish to travel is very important to award booking.  Let?s explain something about award tickets.  Airlines don?t like planes flying with empty seats.   When you are already carrying 190 people, filling the last 10 seats on a 200 person capacity plane have very low incremental cost.  If the airline thinks there are a bunch of seats that won?t be sold or generate any revenue, the airline will make those seats available as award seats.  Conversely, when the airline knows that they will sell every seat, then they are unlikely to make any award seats available.  Why would they settle for the incremental revenue from an award seat, while they can sell a ticket?

So basically, award seats are seats that the airlines don?t think they will sell.  Some airlines have a practice to make n number of award seats available on each flight, and those airlines are well loved in this hobby for their predictability.  Many airlines also wait until 1-2 weeks before travel date, and open up any still unsold seats for award travel.

So coming back to the dates and how airline practices impacts your award plans.  If you are trying to book on a date when the airlines will sell every seat, you are unlikely to find award availability as the airlines are likely to reserve those for paying customers.  For example, Spring Break and Summer Vacation in Hawaii, long weekends to anywhere, and Christmas in Australia are all difficult redemptions in terms of availability.  Not impossible, but difficult.  In addition, if you are booking on an airline that always releases seats 330 days in advance, you may have to book them 330 days i advance.  Some people book them within minutes of those seats becoming available.

A typical scenario often asked by newcomers, is that I want a fantastic vacation 3 months from now, during summer.  Or I finally got my points, and would like to visit Japan in 4 months.  These types of requests are often during peak travel times, to very popular destinations. 3-4 months is just making your life harder as most awards are likely gone before then.

Another scenario is someone only has 5 week days of vacation, so they are trying to travel on a Saturday, and come back the net Sunday to max out their time not he ground.  Well, hundreds of other people would love to travel those specific time, and the award seats will again be hard to come by.  Specific travel dates, or even times, is rough when planning award travel.  To maximize your chance of success, be flexible.

How flexible?  First, can you fly out on a Tuesday or Wednesday?  If you can avoid the peak travel dates for a particular route, you are more likely to find award seats.  This applies to the return as well, as a matter of fact, can you stay a couple of days more or one day less, in order to find the award seats.  How about flying to a different city?  If you can?t find seats to Paris, what about flying into Frankfurt, and then take a train to Paris?

Also, plan plan plan.  If you know that every year, you will be flying into SoCal for Christmas, can you book that award seat 330 days in advance?  Don?t wait until 3-4 months out.

##Get The Names RIGHT!

For the folks who haven?t travelled much, it is absolutely important that the name on the award ticket is exactly the same as the name on the passport. If the names do not match, you might not be able to fly.  Or worse, you might fly out, but the foreign immigration agent may not let you on your return trip because you left out your middle name.

So before booking any award ticket, or indeed, signing up to a FF program, make sure the name you use for all passengers are exactly the same as the name on the passport.  Sometimes, people ask about getting married during that time and a name change.  If you can, leave your passport unchanged, same as the award ticket, until after the travel is done.  Note that airlines can no longer just Change the Name on a ticket.  For an award ticket, this may involve cancelling the award ticket, and hopefully you can book another under the new name, while paying the cancellation fees.

While we are here, let?s talk about Passport expiration when traveling to foreign countries.  Many countries will not allow entrance unless your passport has an expiration date 3 months or 6 months in the future.  Make sure you understand those rules are before doing foreign travel.  While you are at it, make sure you understand whether the country you visit require a visitor Visa.

##Search for Award Availability

Given that almost every airline has a website that allows you to book travel, it would seem like searching for award seats should be really straight forward.  The fact is that searching for award travel is a huge pain.  You also need to be prepared to call the airlines in question, and plan to talk to a real person, possibly not having English as a primary language.

In the most basic scenario, you are using Miles from the ticketing airline that is also the operating airline.  In this case, booking is relatively straight forward.  You login into the airline?s site, and use their flight search functionality.  Usually, there is a checkbox that says something like ?Use Miles?.  Check that, and then search based on your destination and dates.  If any award seats are available, the website will show those to you, along with the cost in Miles.  Note that not all airlines would indicate whether an award is a Savers or Anytime award, so as you look at flights, you may see similar itinerary priced very differently.  If you find what you need and acceptable, just book them through the website.

For a more complex scenario, you are trying to book a partner flight from an airline website.  For this example, let?s say you have AA Miles, and trying to book a J award flight from ORD-HKG, operated by Cathay Pacific.  You first go to the AA website, and enter the desired dates.  When the list of available flights show up, no J awards, and no CX operated flights at all.  You do have a bunch of AA Y awards with 2 transfers showing up.  In this case, the issue isn?t that there are no award seats, but the fact that the AA website does not show all partner award seats.  If you go to the Alaska Airlines website, and enter the same dates, you see that there is a J award on CX.  What it comes down to is you need to know which airlines website to use to find the award seats for each partnership, and whether you actually have Miles in that airline?s program is irrelevant.

In general, if you are looking for an award seat for any airlines in OneWorld, you should search using British Airways or Qantas website.  When dealing with Star Alliance, the United website is sometimes good (Except as of Feb 2019, SQ, Thai, and Turkish flights are NOT showing up on United), but ANA and Aeroplan are often more complete.  For SkyTeam, the common recommendation is to use the Air France Flying Blue website.  Once you think you found an award seat available, write down the dates, time, and flight numbers, and then CALL your FF program airline to try to book the ticket.  Note that the award will cost what the ticketing airline want to charge, and not the airline you used to search for availability.

##Phantom award seats

There are multiple types of Phantom awards, and you need to be mindful when searching award seats.

The first type is just wrong information.  You may often find an award, but it actually does not exist.  So let say you found that elusive pair of J tickets, and you call in AA to book them.  After you give the CSR the flight information, the CSR says there are no award seats.  Giving the CSR exact flight information and operating airline can help, but often times, what you are seeing is A) a system glitch or B) an inexperienced CSR.  Your best bet in these situations is HUCA (Hang up and call again).  If 3 different CSRs are telling you no award seats, then you can be pretty sure that you are seeing Phantom awards.

The second type of Phantom awards is Partner Availability.  Since each airline may often reserve awards to their own FF, the award seat you found maybe only bookable by members of that FF.  For example, if you find 3 J award seats on CX, your Alaska agent may only see 1 or 2 seats.  The only way to determine if this is the case is to read a lot about other people?s experience when attempting the same awards.

The third type of Phantom awards is really just False Advertisement.  Let say you are trying to book a nice F seat to Sydney, and woah, AA is showing 2 F seats available from LAS-LAX-SYD!  If you look carefully, there is marking for ?Mixed Class?, digging in deeper, you see that AA is offering you the LAS-LAX in F on a regional jet, and the LAX-SYD flight is in Y.  Of course, AA website is pricing this as a F award ticket all the way.  So before you start to despise your CSR because the person can?t find that F seat you found, be careful and make sure there is an actual F award on the long flights.

While we are here, let?s talk a bit about Married Segment.  Airlines are in competition with other airlines, so they may price match a competitor on a certain itinerary.  So if Airline A offers XXX-ZZZ at a good deal, Airline B would offer XXX-YYY-ZZZ at a good price as well.  The same behavior happens in award availability.  Some airlines may offer award seats if you book XXX-YYY-ZZZ, but there are no award seats if you just want to fly YYY-ZZZ.

##Transfer the Points/Miles

This section probably requires one or more guides on it?s own, but I?ll try to cover the basic here.  Let say you have a nice stash of convertible points, say UR, and you just found the ideal flights on United.  Since UA is a transfer partner for UR, you go to the UR website, transfer the necessary points to your UA account, and book the ticket on the UA website.  Piece of cake, right?

Well, this assumes a couple things have to go right: A) you are transferring to an allowed UA account, B) the transfer occurs instantaneous.  For example, people often tries to transfer UR points to their SO or BFF accounts, and Chase imposes certain restrictions to prevent selling of points.  Also, there have been reports of people initiating a transfer, and the points do not show up for days.

So here are some guidelines when transferring points you should follow:

- Understand how long a transfer SHOULD take by reading other people?s experiences.  Also watch for current system status, as systems sometimes are problematic, and certain transfers are temporarily not allowed.
- Understand the rules on whose FF account you can transfer points to.
- Understand if there are velocity limits as to number of transfers allowed per time period.  AmEx may block transfers if you try more than 1 transfer in a short period of time.
- Setup the linkage between your convertible points account and the FF account.  One thing i do is do a test transfer of 1,000 points month before I need them, and make sure they arrive in the right FF account.
- Pray that when the points arrive, the award seat is still available.
- Have a backup plan if the points don?t get there on time.  Remember, most if not all such transfers are non-reversible.  The only cases where they may be reversed is if the Bank Really Screwed Up.

Some airlines allows limited Hold on an award ticket while the points are being  transferred. Korean Airlines was really good, as you could hold an award for months.  Sadly, UR can no longer be transferred to KE.  But you may want to research the airline?s hold policy and use that to reduce your risk.

#Booking the Award

OK, we are at the main event. For some of us, successfully booking an award may even be more exciting than the actual trip?

##Prerequisite

- You have already written down the Dates, Time, Operating Airline, Flight Numbers.  Through your searches, you already know how many F/J/Y seats are available on each of those flights.
- You have the Passport names for each of the passenger.  Ideally, you have the FF number for each passenger as well for the ticketing airline.
- If you are planning for a paid reposition flight, you already searched and found seats on the desired flights.  I will have a separate short guide on buying reposition flights.
- You have Miles already in the FF program.  If each of passenger has Miles in their own account, make sure each account has sufficient Miles.  Unless Airlines offer pooling option, you can?t just move a couple thousand Miles from one account to another.
- You?ve done the research, and understand the potential fees involved for the award ticket.  You also understand the change/cancellation rules.

##The Call

**This section assumes the award ticket you need cannot be easily booked on the ticketing airline website.**

- Call the FF Program airline, and ask for Award Reservations.
- Let the CSR have: Number of passengers, class of service (Y/PE/J/F), origination, destination, date, and operating airline  information.  Offer up that you have specific flight information, but don?t force that onto the CSR immediately.  It will take time for a CSR to catch up to where you?ve spent weeks building up.
- If the CSR finds the availability, have them confirm the date, time, flight number, and award cost.
- Provide the passport names of each of the passenger, triple check this!
- Confirm the final cost in Miles as well as Fees need to be paid via CC.
- Provide CC information.
- Get the PNR or Passenger locator number.  Note that if you are flying on a partner flight, make sure you get the PNR for the partner airline as well.
- Congrats!  Once you have a PNR, your award is booked.  You are not quite done though.

##After the Call

Here are the things I do after booking an award.  Depending on the airlines involved, you can usually complete these in the next 2-5 days.

- Make sure the award is properly tickets.  For example, AA often has partner award tickets in the state ?On Request?.  I basically check each day and see if it has moved to ?Ticketed?.  In the past, I?ve called in 4 days after, and found that AA needed a bit more information, which is why the award was not ticketed.
- Make sure the operating airline knows about me and my award ticket.  You can usually go to the operating airline?s website, and choose an option to Manage Trip/Reservations.  By entering the operating airline?s PNR and passenger name, you can check if the airline has your information correctly (Double check each passenger name!), and if the ticket is issued properly.
- While at the operating airline website, I usually enter travel documentation information, such as passport number and expiration dates.  When possible, I also use that to select seats.  I also enter contact information in case the flight changes.  When booking tickets 330 days in advance, you will often see schedule changes.

##Watch the Award Ticket each month

Once you booked an award, you need to watch your award tickets regularly.  Here are the reasons you need to do this:

- Airline schedule changes.  Your flight may have moved up 2 hours, or moved back an hour.  If you have a connecting flight, you need to make sure any scheduled changes don?t break the connecting flight.  Airlines are supposed to catch these, but you need to do everything you can to prevent travel disruptions the day of.
- Equipment change.  Let say you selected your ideal premium seat, and then the airline change the flight to be operated by a regional jet configuration.  The airline isn?t going to change the equipment back for you, but you could select a different seat, or maybe be moved to a different flight.
- Flight cancellation.  The flight that you have planned for months have been cancelled for that date.  In the ideal case, the airline has another flight they can put you onto, but if no award seats are available, they may not be able to do so.  In this case, having the ticketing airline being the operating airline is better.  If Delta cancels a flight, it is more likely for Delta to open an award seat on another flight to get you where you want to go.  If you booked your CX flight with AA miles, and CX cancels the flight, and no other CX flights that day have award seats, you may end up with a free refund of your AA miles.  On certain routes, AA may try to route you on their own metal, but that is only if the ticketing airline offer flights on that route.

Ideally, the ticketing airline should contact you if any changes occur to your flight.  In practicality, the communication is often lost or confusing.  By checking in on your ticket regularly, you have more time to make adjustments to your trip. 

##What if you need to change/cancel the award ticket?

Understand the rules about award ticket changes for the ticketing airline before booking that award ticket!  Each FF program is very different in this regards.  For example, AA allows changing the dates, operating airlines, and routing of your award ticket, provided that the origin and destination remains the same.  If you want to cancel, you will incur a fee of $150 per passenger per ticket.  Singapore allows you to make a change to an award ticket, but you need to pay 3,000 SQ miles.  British Airways allows you to cancel an award ticket, and all you need to pay is the taxes on the original ticket.  Read the rules of each FF program you plan to use, so you can set your expectations accordingly.

Note that if the change is out of your control, such as a schedule change by the operating airline, you usually get a free shot to cancel a ticket with no cost.  So if you are booking flights far in advance, and your plans changed, don?t be hasty in paying the cancellation fee.  You might want to wait for an airline schedule change, and use that to cancel your ticket for free.

##What is next?

There are tons of topics we did not cover in this Basics guide.  How to transfer Points, how to actually search for rewards, how to determine which FF to use, etc.  Let me know what topics you would like to see me cover in the future.

I?m looking moreso towards Asia but let?s not limit it so we can share all our favorite redemptions to all over."
"2019-07-24 22:12:34"|"2020 Honeymoon Booked! MCO-JFK-CDG / CPH-JFK-MCO Thanks r/AwardTravel!"|"Title says it all - thanks to this sub for the help (exclusively used the sidebar!). TL;DR at bottom :)


**Background**

We planned to fly from MCO to CDG, spend a few days there, then take a cruise that ended in Copenhagen and fly back to Orlando. Because of the cruise, we had pretty firm dates on flying there and flying back.


**Points**

\~197K Delta SkyMiles (across 2 accounts; 147K/50K)

\~236K Marriott Bonvoy (all in 1 account) + 1 Free Night Cert

\~210K Chase UR (not used - all still available!)

&#x200B;

**Travel**

So because our Delta SkyMiles were spread out over 2 different accounts, we ended up both booking a portion of the trip on our individual accounts. We were diligent to book the flights a little less than one year out, which meant best award availability.


* **MCO - JFK (round trip)**: booked on 50K account, 23.5K Delta SkyMiles per person (comfort+). At time of booking, flight was $389.60 for a valuation of 1.66 vs. TPG valuation of 1.2. Horray!


* **JFK - CDG; CPH - JFK (multi-city):** booked on 147K account, 59K Delta SkyMiles per person (comfort+). At time of booking, flight was $1,028.33 for a valuation of 1.74 vs. TPG valuation of 1.2. Horray!


**Hotels**

Overall, needed 3 nights in Paris (specific dates) and one night in Copenhagen (specific date). For Paris, ended up booking 3 nights at a Cat 4. At time of booking, hotel was $231.00 but paid 25K/night for a valuation of 0.924 vs. TPG valuation of 0.8. Horray!


For Copenhagen, ended up booking 1 night at a Cat 5 and used the free night cert (35K). At time of booking, hotel was $411.00 for a valuation of 1.17 vs. TPG valuation of 0.8. Horray!


**Overall**

Ended up burning through most of 50K skymiles from one account and 118K from the other account while still being able to keep \~30K miles. Additionally, only spent 75K bonvoy points at a great value and still have 161K available. Also, didn't have to touch our 210K UR points... but they're burning a hole in our pockets!


**TL;DR** \- Booked entire honeymoon using award miles/points at fantastic valuations and still have some to spare. Thank you!"
"2018-05-15 22:46:17"|"Traveling to Japan? Read this"|"We've seen a LOT of travel to Japan posts recently. I would like to revive this post from /u/hidingfrommywife1 on booking ANA F through VS: https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/6e82ub/detailed_walkthrough_on_how_to_fly_to_tokyo_in/

tldr: search availability on United.com, identify ""saver"" award flights operated by ANA, call VS at 800.365.9500, feed them flight times + flight class, put flight on hold for 24h (free), transfer points (instant), call back and confirm ticket.

*When searching on United.com, I recommend searching for ""nonstop only"", award flights (obviously), and picking business or first for class of service. Then, once you're on the actual results page, you can use the 30-day calendar in the middle of the screen. With those filters in place, anything on the calendar with 110k will be saver availability (for F, that is)

F: 110k ~~SEA~~, ~~SJC~~, SFO, LAX - 120k JFK, ORD, IAH, IAD

J: 90k - 95k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Y: 60k - 65k (better to book through ANA, but if you only have UR, this is an option)

Booking through ANA:

[Low/Regular/High Seasons (also where I obtained these mileage values)](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/amc/reference/tukau/award/int/usage.html)

Y: 40,000	50,000	55,000	

J: 75,000	85,000	90,000

F: 150,000	150,000	165,000



Other common questions:

* You can transfer to VS from all major currencies
* You can only transfer MR to ANA
* NRT and HND are co-terminals. You can fly into one and out the other
* You can redeem as an open jaw. Any US Airport  serviced by ANA -> either TYO airport. Either TYO airport -> any US airport serviced by ANA
* Is F worth it? Yeah its pretty cool. But J would probably adequately satisfy you. The reason F is more popular is because J availability is somewhat scarce. 110/120k on VS versus ~85k biz (either booking method) isn't that much worse though. ANA F for 150k is probably not worth it.
* F is cool but not that great for flying with a companion (hard to talk to them)
* Other choices: you can also get to TYO on United (lots of miles) [or using AA miles on JAL](https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/redeem/award-travel/oneworld-and-other-airline-partner-award-chart.jsp)  (find availability on ba.com, call aa to book), and through Delta."

I travel a lot for work (40% of the time) and I get to keep all the miles and points. So far this has landed me elite status in all Hilton hotels and National Car Rental.

I really liked delta - used to get upgraded a lot even as a silver medallion and recently have been finding great award redemptions too (12k for rt flights from Chicago to both coasts). The only problem is the lack of direct flights to Boston, SF and LA - which means I?d have to connect each time I flew there.

Should I hit gold on American and then status match back to silver on delta and go back to using delta? Or stick with American?

I could have saved points by leaving the next morning from LAX, but the schedule wouldn't take opportunity of being able to rest before getting to MLE. I've adjusted my itinerary to leave SJC a little earlier for 669 more points.

"2016-03-10 16:03:42"|"Overview of Getting to Europe Using Chase URs"|"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/), I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:


***Chase URs***

Chase offers only one personal card that allows for the transfer of Ultimate Rewards points to airline partners ? the Sapphire Preferred card. Chase is pretty strict with their approvals for this card, so if you have picked up more than 5 credit cards in the past 24 months, chances are good you will be denied if you apply for this card, so plan accordingly/carefully.

Your URs will transfer to 6 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
United | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
Southwest | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your URs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Korean Air**

Korean Air is a SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can redeem your SkyPass miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Korean Air is largely considered to be one of the best bang for your buck redemptions to Europe in general and is the best option among UR transfer partners.

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 50k miles for coach, 80k miles for business class and 100k miles for first class ? which is the best option for premium cabin redemptions to Europe. Korean Air does allow for one-way award tickets, but as u/wiivile pointed out, the cost is the same for a one-way award as it is for a roundtrip. You are also allowed one stopover on a one-way award ticket and two stopovers on a roundtrip award ticket, which is truly incredible considering you are already getting one of the best redemption rates to Europe to begin with.

While Korean Air Skypass miles offer one of the best values, it can be difficult to work with Korean Air. If you are planning to use your miles to book an award ticket for another person, that other person has to be a family member (mother, father, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, wife, husband or child). You will also need to call in to Korean Air to book your award and the process is somewhat arduous. I would recommend that you call in to make sure space is available and then place a hold on your award ticket(s) before transferring your URs to your Skypass account.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your URs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe ? especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore?s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**United**

United is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. As with Singapore Airlines, that means you are going to have a ton of options!

United uses a two-tier award system for their awards. Economy tickets are the same cost regardless of whether you are on a United flight or a partner flight. A roundtrip saver coach award ticket will cost you 60k miles.

Business and first class award tickets on the other hand will differ in price depending on whether you are flying on a United operated flight or a partner operated flight. For United operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 115k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 160k miles. Alternatively, for partner operated flights, a roundtrip saver business class award ticket will cost you 140k miles and a roundtrip saver first class award ticket will cost you 220k miles.

As you can see, the much better value when redeeming for premium cabins is with United operated flights ? though the actual product is going to be far less enticing than what some of United?s partners such as Swiss Air offer. Since Singapore Airlines would have access to much of the same award inventory as United, you are better off transferring your URs to them instead and then booking the exact same flights for 5-60k miles less.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the worst UR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Southwest**

Unfortunately Southwest does not currently fly to Europe, nor do they have any partners that fly to Europe. If you have a Chase co-branded Southwest credit card, there is a way around this to use your RapidRewards points for international travel, but the value is usually exceedingly poor and I will not get into how to do so here as it will rarely work out in your favor.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your URs!"
"2019-06-25 01:26:29"|"List: When Airlines Open Award Availability"|"Here is a list of some airlines and a VERY incomplete list of when they open up award availability. Some of the dates, I have verified. Others I have not and I know some are wrong. I live 16-19 time zones away from most of you, so many dates are +- a day. Due to my time zone ?issues,? my strategy is to look a week or two before I think my days are bookable and use that to calibrate the exact day I can book.

Sometimes time zones make a difference if you want to snag an award that is released on a schedule. As a general rule, if the booking airline is the limiting one, it will be released according to their time zone. If the operating carrier is the limiting one, there is a higher chance it will be released based off of the operating carriers time zone.  As a general rule, an airline cannot book partner award space before they open up bookings for their own space.  Qantas is one exception to this rule.

Please help complete this list. It is old and out of date. Feel free to correct dates, add airlines, or add dates.

**Edit: How to use this list.** If you are booking a partner award look at the line for the airline you are looking to fly **and** the airline that operates the mileage program you are booking through. The lower of the two numbers is when you can book the seat. Example: Booking JAL via AA. JAL seats become available at 360 days and AA allows booking 331 days out.  You can book these seat 331 days out. Remember that the time zone of the more restricted airline/program is what matters.

If you are trying to book a seat with a program that does not allow you to book at schedule opening, like the JAL example.  You can check JAL's website at 331+ to get an idea of what seats will be available when AA gets access to JAL's space.

The exact time of day does matter for some bookings.  Please leave any time DP you have in the comments.

Your dream getaway is now in reach. 

For this week only, miles are worth double with Delta Vacations when you book any vacation package. Now, $1,000 towards a vacation package costs 50,000 miles instead of 100,000 miles.

ETA: called, you don't have to book hotel the entire trip and can book mutli-city over the phone. Hotel stay minimums depend on destination: 2 nights CONUS, 3 nights Europe, 4 nights Asia. Hotels do not need to be consecutive or in the same city.

Due to work and planned leisure trips I will be flying ALOT in 2019, enough to earn Delta Diamond or United Premier 1k by the end of the year. I currently have Delta Gold (with not much rollover MQMs) which I can easily complete the status match with United on my first few trips. I'm looking for some insight from both elite programs to help me decide!

Home airport: BDL (so neither United/Delta hub, both fly there and prices for each are pretty cheap). Also an easy train ride to NYC

Planned trips
-Domestic flights 3x a month (everywhere, both United and Delta Hubs) 

-London and Shanghai in March

-Sydney in June

-RTW trip using Amex MR points in July-Aug for vacation (exploring mainly SEA)

Right now I have 100k+ miles from Delta, but the Star Alliance network seems so much better from what I heard. Also, I have Amex platinum which gives me Delta lounge with domestic flights, but honestly I find escape lounges/PP restaurants better anyways.

Because this trip is for our anniversary I want to splurge on business class for the transatlantic legs since my husband has only ever flown premium economy and never been overseas.

"2018-02-25 02:59:55"|"PSA: Availability matters more than award charts"|"A lot of folks have dropped by lately having read about the sweetest sweet spots in award charts and wanting help booking them. Given the large number of blog articles touting these it's easy to develop unrealistic expectations around the possibility of booking these awards.

Most of the very best award chart sweet spots involve partner awards with limited availability. For example, you can use Korean Air Skypass points to book flights on Delta. However, the number of seats available if you're using the Korean Air program is much more limited than if you're using the (often more expensive) Delta SkyMiles program.

Think of frequent flier programs as a department store, and pricing as follows:

* Standard award rates: Full price. When you're shopping in a department store for the latest fashion that is in high demand, you may be able to buy it, but you won't get a bargain.
* Saver award rates: Clearance sale. When you're shopping clearance sales, you're buying fashion out of season, or stuff that didn't sell. It's the same thing with airline seats. The best seats at the best times of year to the best destinations aren't the ones that you can get for a sale price.
* Factory Outlet Sale: You know those factory outlet stores? The ones in the distant, distant, distant suburbs where you can score some incredible bargains (far better than even a department store clearance sale) on an extremely limited selection, and with no real idea before you get there what you might find? That's a partner award chart sweet spot. Also, there are no refunds or returns.

So, is it impossible to score a great deal, like a 25k mile roundtrip flight to Hawaii? Nope! If you like the thrill of the hunt and are willing to turn over rocks to find a great bargain, you can do this. It isn't easy, though, and you will need to be really flexible, and you may need to comply with strange rules like faxing in a copy of your marriage certificate. If you want a refund, this might be complicated (or it might be easier, depends on the program). And this usually works best if you only want one or two seats. 

Should you pass up a good sale on something you want just because at some point, someone might have gotten (or might later get) a better deal in a factory outlet store? Of course not. Although buying a standard award fare is (like paying full price at a department store) rarely a good deal, saver awards usually offer solid value. Even if you don't manage to land the cheapest sweet spot on the cheapest award chart, saver awards can still be a great deal."

"2018-10-16 12:04:55"|"[Huge issue] AA doesn't consider pre-clearance while accounting for Minimum Connecting Time"|"**PLEASE READ FULL POST BEFORE DOWNVOTING/COMMENTING.**

So, here's the issue:

I'll arrive at JFK via an AA-partnered international flight and will have to take a domestic AA flight to CLT, all on the same ticket.

But my incoming flight at JFK would've had pre-clearance, so no customs clearance or immigration check-in would be required. My baggage will be transferred to AA due to an inter-line agreement between AA & its partner.

AA is not allowing me to book another flight that's after 65 minutes of my arrival into JFK, as its systems determine the MCT (Minimum Connecting Time) for an international flight to domestic flight connection at JFK to be 120 minutes. However, flights that've had pre-clearance should be treated as domestic! So, AA should use its domestic MCT value while calculating feasibility of an itinerary, if an international flight has had pre-clearance!

Because of this issue, AA has put me on a domestic flight that's late 38% of the time, with 58 minutes as the average delay. I've another flight after this one, which is 44 minutes later. But if the chronically-delayed flight would be delayed, I'd miss the next segment & the next AA flight to the destination would be after 11 hours, and of course, AA won't pay for a hotel, if it screws me over!

I've spoken to AA agents, a supervisor & her manager, but they told me they can't override it as it's 'illegal' and that the FAA would fine them 25k per incident. AFAIK, the 'illegality' is internal AA lingo for in-feasibility, and not related to any law.

How can I override the MCT set by AA? Has anyone had success in doing so?

For Delta, MCT for connections involving international flights that've had pre-clearance, to domestic flights, is 30 minutes.

&#x200B;

**TLDR** \- For connections from international flights with pre-clearance to domestic flights, Minimum Connecting Time should be considered to be that of domestic flights, because the flights of the former type are treated as domestic flights (customs-clearance & immigration check-in is completed at pre-clearance sites). American Airlines uses the MCT for international flights to domestic flights, while Delta is saner in this regard (and maybe its ticketing staff is saner too. Delta staff has never asked me to go fly with the competition)."

- Timeframe - travel before and after the 4th of July (high season)
-  Destination choices from LA -  NYC, DC, Philly, Boston, Hawaii, Costa Rica, Cancun (as you can see, we were open to go just about anywhere)
- Points budget - no more than 25K/person roundtrip (I made sure I have enough remaining for other trips planned in the fall.

All the destinations I chose did not work out, they were either unavailable or the points were going to cost so much more per person. I checked United, British Avios, Singapore Air, Korean Air, Delta, Jet Blue, Southwest - made multiple calls to no avail. The only thing that worked out, ironically since the available dates were for around the 4th of July, was British Avios from LAX to Maui.

Since we have been getting the question almost daily, I decided to put together a 101 type of post on one of the processes for finding the best/least expensive redemption. You can [read the original post here](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/award-tickets-101-how-to-find-the-best-redemption/) which includes all the tables. As always, these types of posts take a good amount of time to research and put together, so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies, incorrect ratios or information. 

So let me walk you through the process of how to find the best award redemption for your points and miles!

It should go without saying (yet it still needs to be said), but your first step in finding the best redemption is picking a destination. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are departing from Orlando (MCO) and want to travel to Lima, Peru (LIM) in economy class.

Now that you have your destination picked out, the next step is to take stock of the points and miles balances that you have available to use. This balance can be found online by signing into your respective awards accounts. For purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you have the following points balances:

55k American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points

55k Citi ThankYou Points (TYP)

65k Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) points

54k American Airlines (AA) miles

54k Delta SkyMiles

34k United MileagePlus miles

Now that you know where we want to go and what points you are working with, you need to make a list of the airlines that you could transfer your transferable currencies (MR, UR and TYP) to.

Your MRs will transfer to the following airlines at the following ratios:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time

Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

Now that you know where you can transfer your transferable currencies, you need to make a list of the potential mileage you would have in each program. That list would look like this:

Airline | Alliance | Total Mileage Balance
:--------:|:--------:|:---------: 
Delta | SkyTeam | 109,000 Miles
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 110,000 Miles
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
Korean Air | SkyTeam | 65,000 Miles
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 55,000 Miles
American Airlines	 | OneWorld | 54,000 Miles
British Airways | OneWorld | 109,000 Miles
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 44,000 Miles
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 110,000 Miles
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qantas | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 55,000 Miles
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 175,000 Miles
United Airlines | Star Alliance | 99,000 Miles
EVA Air | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 55,000 Miles
Virgin America | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 175,000 Miles
Jet Blue | N/A | 44,000 Points
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 55,000 Miles
El Al | N/A | 1,100 Points
Emirates | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Etihad | N/A | 55,000 Miles
Southwest | N/A | 65,000 Miles
 
With this list, you now know how many miles/points you have to work with in each program. The next step is to start looking at the award charts for each of those airlines that you could utilize with your points/miles. You can find the charts for most of the major programs in either the sidebar or the Wiki. This process can be a bit time intensive, but you should be able to find award charts for most every airline online by doing a simple Google search for ?yyy Award Chart? (with ?yyy? being the airline you are searching).

A few things to keep in mind with award charts:

1) Delta eliminated their award chart approximately a year ago, so you?re not going to find an award chart online for them. Instead, simply enter in your origin, destination and date(s) on their website to determine the award cost.

2) Southwest and JetBlue tie their award ticket cost to the cash price of the ticket. This means that there is no set award chart and you award cost is instead entirely dependent on how expensive (on inexpensive) a cash ticket for a trip would cost you.

While reviewing the award charts, I generally recommend that you write down the 2-3 least expensive options in each alliance, as well as the 4 least expensive options for non-alliance airlines. This allows you to have multiple options to search for award space with if the least expensive option shows no award space for your desired dates/class of service.

In the example of a flight to Lima, that list would look this:

Airline | Alliance | RT Redemption Cost
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
American Airlines (Off-peak) | OneWorld | 30k Miles (pre-deval); 35k Miles (post-deval)
British Airways | OneWorld | 40k Miles
United | Star Alliance | 40k Miles
ANA | Star Alliance | 50k Miles
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 35k Miles
Delta | SkyTeam | 45k Miles
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 45k Miles (Delta)

With the short list of best redemption values in mind, you can start the process of searching for award space utilizing miles on those carriers. Most every airline these days allows you to search for award space online. Sometimes to search for partner award space you will need to utilize a different program to search. For example, if you were looking to redeem Korean Air miles for a Delta flight from Orlando to Lima, you would be better off using the Alaska Airlines or FlyingBlue search tools to find award space.

A few other things to keep in mind with this process:

1) You can usually book award tickets on partner airlines, so just because you are using United miles does not necessarily mean that you would have to be flying on a United flight.

2) Certain airlines will allow a free stopover or open-jaws which can create additional value in your redemption. A stopover is a stop in a city for more than 24 hours on the way to or from your destination. Your award ticket might look like this ? Orlando-Bogota-Lima-Orlando. An open-jaw is where you start in one city and return to a different city on one award ticket. Your award ticket might look like this ? Orlando-Lima-New York. Stopovers and open-jaws are a bit more advanced so I will not get into those on this post, but they are definitely something to be aware of.

3) Be cognizant of airlines that use a distance based award chart (British Airways, Iberia, ANA, etc.) as the particular routing you utilize could substantially increase or decrease the cost of your award ticket.

4) Do NOT transfer your points until you have confirmed that there is both award space showing and that the airline you intend on booking with can both see and book that space. Several airlines will also allow you to place a hold on the award ticket for 1-5+ days, so it never hurts to ask if you can place the seat on a hold while you transfer your points.

5) The award chart for the carrier you plan on redeeming your miles with will control ? regardless of the airline that is operating the flight. For example, a flight from Orlando to Lima on LAN using AA miles will be charged according to AA?s award chart ? not LAN?s.

**No Destination In Mind?**

What if you just want to see where your points/miles can take you though? Well, in that case you are better off taking stock of the points/miles balances you have available, figuring out how many miles you would be able to utilize in each of the programs you could transfer your points to/already have points or miles in, and then reviewing the award charts for each of those airlines to see what your options are. This is a very time consuming process though, so be prepared to put some time in.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the process that I use for determining the best redemption value for my points and miles, so hopefully it helps shed some light on how to find the best redemption value for your trip."
"2019-05-16 14:48:45"|"Award Flights to New Zealand Booking Experience"|"I currently live in New Zealand and have booked 15-20 USA-New Zealand J awards in the past 18 months using many programs. With the addition of AA and United flying nonstop, it has become less of a unicorn than it was. It does involve a little more planning. Here is a lot of the information that I have learned about the specific route and my general booking process.  I have included many booking options but ran out of steam to include them all. It may also ramble since it was mainly written to pass time without internet coverage in the car.

  
**Nonstop**  
**Air New Zealand (NZ)**  
This space is hard to come by in J. A little easier in Y. The best way to look for space is an Expert Flyer alert since availability tends to be random if it opens up at all. More likely, one seat to open up, but I have seen multiple. More offseason space released. YVR, SFO, LAX, IAH, ORD, HNL.   
**United (UA)**  
Nonstop year round SFO-AKL, during \~April-October it does not fly every day. They do open up J space randomly on this route. I have seen 8+ J seats available, but this is an exception, not the rule. Do not expect saver availability around Christmas. I have seen J space released to partners. SFO.   
**American (AA)**  
Nonstop LAX-AKL daily seasonal, roughly November-March. They do release space on this route, but the release is not predictable. Some are close in, and some are further out. I have seen a lot of married segment logic on this route. PHX is a good city to use if you are looking for a default city that shows most married segment logic. LAX.   
**Air Canada**  
Nonstop YVR-AKL, 4X week, mid-December- end March. This route is brand new (hasn?t been flown yet), but they have released some J space. I anticipate there will be some changes for the 2020/21 ?season? after they see how the route does. YVR. 

  
**Connections**  
Three main regions are used for connections to New Zealand: Australia, South Pacific, and Asia. Not all programs allow you to connect through all the regions. Almost all allow you to connect through Australia. If you are connecting through Australia on NZ a320/a321s they are a one cabin aircraft and do not have J (772, 773, and 787 do have J).

  
**Booking Through Award Programs**  
**AA**  
Their routing rules allow you to connect through the South Pacific and Australia to New Zealand, but not through Asia. AA is a pain to search since they often show a domestic F flight and a TPAC economy flight as a J award.  
Direct: Flying the seasonal AA LAX-SFO route  
Australia: Flying AA or Qantas to Australia and then Qantas to AKL, WLG, CHC, or ZQN. Qantas opens up flights \~360 days, which can reduce availability for AA at 330 days.   
Air Tahiti New: Decent availability has been showing in J without overnight connections when the schedule opens. Shows on AA?s website and flies to AKL.  
Fiji: Not the best product and availability is hit or miss. Remember to search for flights to AKL, WLG, and CHC since sometimes availability isn?t available on the final leg to each destination.  
Qatar: This counts as two awards and is in the process of getting Qsuites. Availability has been pretty decent for AKL-DOH in late 2018/early 2019.    
**ANA(NH)**  
This is the program that it is the easiest to find availability to New Zealand since they allow you to create your a routing with three connections. You have to fly TPAC, must book roundtrip, and are allowed one stopover. ANA?s search engine is pretty limited when searching, but you can use a multi-destination search to ?force? your routing. ANA?s search engine typically does not include flights that connect from the US to ICN, TPE, PEK, or PVG on their searches. Remember to search for AKL, WLG, CHC, and ZQN. It can be time intensive to find an award, but I have never not been able to piece together a J award. Singapore opens up a decent amount of space on their AKL-SIN and WLG-SIN (regional product).   
**Alaska (AS)**  
Alaska has a different award chart for each of their partners. You can mix Alaska flights with a partner, but you cannot use multiple partners on one ticket. You are allowed a stopover on a one-way award. This gives you more flexibility since your TPAC and flight to NZ can have availability on separate days.   
Cathay Pacific: Must be booked via phone, use BA or QF to find availability, but keep in mind CX often releases one less seat to AS than One World partners. AKL, CHC  
Fiji: Can be searched on AS. Availability is sometimes different than Expert Flyer. AKL, WLG, CHC  
Qantas: Can be searched on AS. AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN  
Korean: Must book roundtrip. Searchable on AS. AKL  
**Avianca/Lifemiles**  
I have seen a lot of restrictions on what routes you can book with Lifemiles to New Zealand. They tend to be more restrictive than UA and ANA, but I still have found availability with them. You generally cannot create your routing. They do allow Asia connections.   
**Cathay**  
You can get additional award availability if you book directly. AKL and CHC.   
**Delta**  
Delta does not fly to New Zealand, and the rates are typically extremely high. They are partners with Virgin Australia, and you can connect through Australia. China Eastern (PVG), China Southern (CAN), Korean (ICN), and China Airlines (TPE-BNE-AKL) are Sky Team members that fly to AKL.   
**JAL**  
The cheapest way to book Emirates from AKL. Leaving AKL the YQ (fuel surcharge) is pretty low. The other One World information applies, watch for YQ. The rates tend to be reasonable, but the miles are tough to get. You can book 360 days out and will have access to One World inventory 360 days out.  
**Qantas**  
The advantage of booking directly with Qantas is that you can book \~360 days out and they sometimes release availability at the start of the schedule for their US routes. There is YQ, and the mileage amounts are typically higher than booking via AA.  
**Singapore**  
Partner award rates are very high, and UA in most cases would be a better option. If you want to fly SQ TPAC in a premium cabin, you almost always need to book directly through SQ since they basically never release those seats to partners. Starting in 2018 it does seem that there are releasing a lot more J space to partners from SIN-AKL/WLG/Australia  
**United**  
UA lets you route through Asia to get to New Zealand. The routes that they allow are highly variable and hard to figure out. I recommend searching for many US cities and AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN. UA?s issues booking various Asian carriers award space has reduced space connecting in Asia. You cannot piece together your own award. You can currently waitlist flights on UA metal and prepay for them (not sure if this is/will be possible after November 15). I have had success on the AKL-SFO route with this clearing 48 hours before departure.   
**Virgin Atlantic (VS)**  
Most of the talk with VS is about booking ANA to Japan. They have a great rate on NZ metal of 62.5k in J between the US and New Zealand (transfer bonuses put this between 48-55k). The issue is that this is the unicorn flight (unless you are flying May-August). There is award space released randomly, and Expert Flyer is your best bet. I have managed to book this award before.  A good option for May-August when NZ released more space.

  
**Strategy**   
I first decide what is my optimal booking. Do I want to fly CX, nonstop, stopover in Asia/Fiji? Then I look at how many seats I am trying to book. I then figure out when award seats open up for my desired booking. If I am not at that date, I monitor what award seats become available and if I think it will open up at schedule opening. If the schedule is already open, I search to see if there is availability. If there isn?t, I search for other routes. If I cannot find any award availability that pops up in searching, there are 3 main options I consider.   
\-Booking with ANA via Asia. You can create your own itinerary, and as long as you can find a TPAC to somewhere in Asia you should be able to stitch together a routing. This does take some time. 

\-Set Expert Flyer alerts for every nonstop NZ, UA, and AA nonstop flight that would work. Space does come available randomly.   
\-If there is UA economy saver space, waitlisting J via UA.   


I am willing to book a one-way flight and wait for a return flight. The only exception is mid-December through mid-January.   
Through the entire process, I keep in mind how many tickets I am trying to book.   
1 ticket- Higher likelihood of NZ award seat becoming available. Higher likely of AA seat becoming available within 90 days.   
2 tickets- Nonstop flights are still a possibility. NZ frequently only releases 1 J seat on many of their Asia routes at schedule opening so I count on them. A very doable number.   
3+ tickets- This gets tricky. I have seen UA release I9, which is at least 9 J award seats. This is not normal. The ANA route can be a little more difficult with 3+. The TPAC will be your most challenging flight, followed by the last flight to New Zealand, but there are frequently 3+ seats between New Zealand and Australia. UA waitlist on separate PNRs is a good backup if you can find saver Y.

edit: A lot of the routing rules and general information of this post apply when flying to Australia since almost all award charts combing Australia and New Zealand in the same region. The capacity to Australia is about 4-5 times greater than New Zealand and I have not included a breakdown of flights to Australia."

For example, I'd like to plan a trip with stops in Norway and Iceland to do some hiking, then finish up in Dublin to relax a little before heading home.

"2019-07-29 19:30:27"|"Florida Keys Vacation"|"Hi all,

I'm trying to put together a somewhat economical trip for my family of 4 to go down to Key West for 5 nights somewhere around the dates of Mar 13-18 (with some flexibility), flying from Asheville, NC.  Here are the points that I am working with:

Delta: 77k (Currently Silver)

Hilton: 240k (Currently Gold)

Hyatt: 50k (Currently Discoverist)

Barclays CC Points: 85k (Worth $850 in travel credits)

So far, I have found flights from AVL to EYW for $388 each, or 34k points each +$11.  My thought is to get 2 tickets with Delta points, and then cover the remaining $776 with my Barclays points.

For hotels, I'm seeing a number of options:

Hyatt Centric Key West: 25k Hyatt Points per Night

Hilton Garden Inn Key West: 60k Hilton Points per Night

Casa Marina Key West: 90k Hilton Points per Night

Baker's Cay Resort: 80k Hilton Points per Night

The Reach Waldorf Astoria: 80k Points per Night

My initial thought is to do a stay at the 60k Hilton Garden Inn for the first night, and then finish out the remaining 4 nights at one or two of the fancier resorts.  Maybe 2 nights at the Hyatt Centric, and 2 nights at The Reach Waldorf Astoria?

Quick questions:

* I was trying to find a good way to swing the 5th night free with Hilton, but other than the Garden Inn I wouldn't have enough points to make that happen.  Anything I am missing here?
* Many of these resorts have $50-ish per night resort fees.  Any idea if those are still charged with points redemptions?
* Is it wise to book this far ahead in advance?  Any idea what the sweetspot would be for booking a March trip?
* Does anyone have experience with any of these hotels, or which would be the best bang for the buck?
*  This would be my first trip to the Keys, so any suggestions/recommendations would be helpful!

Thanks in advance."

Booking Success"|"  I just booked a trip to go on a safari and visit Cape Town pretty much exactly 11 months in advance, and have never seen a post about this booking so figured I would share. Booking Delta One ATL-JNB is 60k Virgin Atlantic miles each way, however using the current MR promo brought it down to 94k RT. If you are looking to book this, you will most likely have to jump on booking the outbound flight first as soon as the schedule opens, and then being patient and waiting for the flight home to open up and booking that separate. Once I booked the outbound leg, I was fully prepared for a situation where I would have to fly home using a different strategy so keep that in the back of your mind, as I was a little less flexible with my date to fly home.

When searching to book this, I found that the outbound ATL-JNB leg is easier to find, with 2 J seats opening up on average 3-4 days of the week when looking out exactly 11 months, the JNB-ATL leg for me was a lot more hit or miss, I booked my flight home today and there was more than 4 seats available on Saturday, April 11th, but before that the only availability was the Tuesday prior. Saturday/Sunday seem to have more availability, for booking the outbound I put the flight on hold for 72 hours and waited to make sure I was flying outbound on the best possible day to optimize travel.

I will be positioning from Texas, with a quick 2 hour flight the night prior to keep it safe, and would imagine this would not be a problem for anybody on the east coast, as flights to ATL are around $100 each way. I don?t like using CPP but in this case the total flight cost is in the range of 8-10k USD. Lastly, while the current flights are not delta one suites, when choosing a seat a year in advance it does show that will be the future layout."

If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve card a $800 cash ticket is just over 53,000 Ultimate Rewards points with FULL points earn on the ticket itself. That's a great deal if you don't care about sitting up front.  
Business class is significantly more expensive. This is one of the most sought after premium class routes on the planet and with that prices tend to stay high and award availability low. 

####From the East Coast of the US  
I highly recommend AA to DFW and Qantas DFW-SYD. The route is served by a comfortable A380 (good economy, dated 2-2-2 J though) and loads are typically intentionally kept low heading East to maximize cargo capacity. That means you can realistically expect a empty middle seat if you plan well. On the eastbound side it's still possible but less likely. Also, if you fly on low days you may score an upgrade for $1,000 - $1,200 USD per person, per way, via Qantas' bid for upgrade program. Really the major benefit here is connections going further into the US - minimizing travel time on either side of that long leg is incredibly more valuable and comfortable.

####From the West Coast of the US
Any carrier works here, chose based on your preference. Every domestic carrier serves the route (UA/AA/DL) and most are newer aircraft (sans Delta's aging 777s). You can also find good deals via Fiji as well as via Auckland on Air New Zealand. I personally don't like breaking up the trip any more than necessary so I don't like those options.  

###Points  
Oh boy, this is a good one. Generally the rule of thumb is simply this, **PLAN AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO FLY UP FRONT!** The only exception to this is Virgin Australia who sometimes releases J space < 2 weeks of travel. That's absolutely rolling the dice though. Economy wise you can typically find space on at least one carrier so that's less of a topic, and as above, with cash prices being so low it can often be less worthwhile to book the award itself.  
Up front you really have a few options.   
 &nbsp;  

**US Carriers**  
 &nbsp;  
  
Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---
United | 338 | Good J hard product, meh soft product. Awards open up here and there but typically it's very limited to last minute redemption. Price-wise, they're not the cheapest, but not the most expensive.  
AA | 331| probably the best hard produce from the group. Same meh soft product (they're US carriers after all). Pricing is also okay, but availability is next to none.  
Delta | 331| bad products, hard and soft. The seats are old, the service is older. Price is highest BUT you will often find saver-level seats on Virgin Australia (a partner) < 2 weeks out.  
   &nbsp;  
**Australian Carriers**  
 &nbsp;

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Qantas| 353 | meh J product (2-2-2). Good/Great F. Service is also good, very polished. Availability in spurts, but okay price via AA.   
Virgin Australia | 330 | best seat (the Business) and I'm a sucker for a bird with a bar. Conversely, terrible availability unless you're looking within 2 weeks or right at the window. 
 &nbsp;  
**Asian Carriers (generally better availability)**  
 &nbsp;  

Carrier| Booking Window | Comments
---|---|---  
Korean | 360? | my personal favorite. Great airline, great US service, and a transfer partner of Chase. And most importantly, they tend to be quite generous with their availability. 
Cathay | 360 | old favorite in the points world. Not the cheapest option but if you have the points then you'll often find availability through HKG when you book at the window. Great seat, classic service, and AMAZING lounges in HKG. 
JAL | 330 | like ANA, in light of recently US carrier devaluations these guys have become a viable option through Tokyo. Some recommend their 777 SkySuite as the best J product out there. 
SQ | 355 | Suites are always a favorite but lately it's pretty impossible to not pull your hair out before actually confirming that route. J availability tends to show up here and there. Recently devauled though so use tool to find best option based on points available. 
ANA | 356 | mentioned in JAL topic, just a solid all around option if you have the points. 
 &nbsp;  
**Award Tools**  
Look, I know a lot of carriers were mentioned above and you're probably going well, that's all great, but how do I ultimately choose one given the fact that I have a trip 1+ year out and a few options? That's where the below sites come in handy. They will tell decipher award charts and help you distill down the airlines that you can realistically fly given the points that you have.

##Once In The Region
###Intra-Region Travel 
  
* Staying in the South/South East (SYD/BNE/MEL/PER/etc.) - Avios, Avios, Avios! SYD-MEL, for example, is 4,500 Avios one way on Qantas. This is an amazing sweet spot. 
* Cross Country Travel - This is tough. Economy prices aren't terribly high, but the business class product on these flights is top notch. Virgin flies ""The Business"" A330 and Qantas flies an equivalent A330 through the continent and they really cater to those premium travelers. I still haven't come up with the best way of doing this with points though local frequent flyers swear by the points upgrade to get up front. 
* Across the Ditch (To/From NZ) - My recommendation is Air New Zealand. I recently booked this and spent 25k Krisflyer (Singapore) for a RT flight on Air New Zealand. I definitely consider that tremendous value, though discount carriers operate these routes and you can find deals (I would consider $300 round trip in economy to be a good deal).

###Sydney-Specific
Rule of thumb, if you have 5+ days in the region than I suggest going outside of Sydney. It's a cool city, but there is SO much more to see. Scroll down for details, but while in Sydney here are a few suggestions:

* Taronga Zoo ? One of my favourites. A great place to see all the local animals that the US doesn?t have. **This is a FANTASTIC first day activity and will help you fight jet lag!**
* Bondi to Cogee Walk ? A beautiful self-guided walk down the coast. It?s just a walking path but it's a must do. 
* Harbour Bridge Climb ? Climb atop Sydney?s most famous bridge to see the city like nowhere else. Younger people love it, older people tend to avoid it. I haven't done it and don't plan to. 
* Sydney Opera House ? The most famous landmark in Sydney. We could see a show or just do a tour. Up to you.
* Manly Ferry/Beach ? Manly beach is amazing and the surrounding area is filled with bars and restaurants. This would take up the majority of a day. The ferry there and back is a mini sightseeing tour in and of itself.
* Sydney Bus Tours - Highly recommended as it takes you all over the city and even out to Bondi. Hop on/Hop off style so you can wander if you like a stop.
* Sydney Boat Tours ? Just like the bus tours, the boat tours allow you to get off at stops and explore. A great way to maneuver around the water and hit the main points of interest. Could be a good way to see Manly, too. Do NOT do a dinner cruise, the food is bad and it's just a waste of time. 
* The Rocks ? Located right in the harbour, the Rocks is an area with numerous restaurants, a famous market and Australia?s oldest pubs.
* Darling Harbour ? Like the Rocks, DH is another touristy area on the water that has a ton of restaurants and bars. Also has a Ferris wheel, an enormous fish market with tons of fresh seafood, and a casino.
* Sydney Seaplanes ? Name says it all. I absolutely LOVED the ""Sydney Secrets"" tour. 
* Featherdale Wildlife Park ? Never been here but it comes highly recommended. Basically it is an animal park where all of the animals are loose and you can interact with them. All of the Australian animals will be there. It is a little bit of a drive but definitely doable.
* Blue Mountains ? A national park that has a bunch of beautiful views and is much different from the water you get all around the city. They have a similar bus tour to all the attractions which lets you hop on/off at will. A train will take us directly up there if you?d like to go.
* Hunter Valley ? Australia is known for its wine and HV is the closest region to the city.
  
**Places to Stay**
  
* Park Hyatt Syndey - go to place for best of the best stays. On Cirqular Quay with views of Opera House. 
* Westin Sydney - downtown, good location (10 min walk from quay), nice hotel. 
* Hilton Sydney - downtown, same as Westin. 
* Intercontinental Double Bay - ritzy area of town, looks to be a nice hotel. I live nearby so I'm biased - it's a good spot but out of the hustle and bustle. 
* Marriott - also downtown, 5 min from quay. Lobby recently redone, rooms are supposedly very nice, too. 
* Four Points Sydney - closer to Chinatown but still downtown. 20 min qay to quay. I've heard it's nice.
* There are tons more, this is a whole topic in an of itself.

###Regional
**Are you outdoorsy?**  
 
* Queenstown, NZ (~3 hour flight) - The end all be all go-to place for being outdoors. If you like being outside/hiking/etc. this should absolutely be on your list See extreme activities section.
* Tasmania - 
* Blue Mountains - see above. 
* Royal National Park (~30 min from Sydney) - great national park with some beautiful hiking spots. Not huge, but easy to get to and is a good excursion.

**Do you like food/drinks?**   

* Melbourne (pronounced Melbun) - Where to begin? Really the best way of thinking about Sydney vs. Melbourne, which is a HUGE rivalry by the way, is to put it simply as > Sydney has the sights whereas Melbourne has the culture. 

**Extreme activities?**   

* Cairnes (pronounced Cans) - the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. Backpacker town (if you want a nicer area near the GBR see Port Douglas) and full of bars and nightlife. If you're younger, want to hang out with some peers, and go diving, go here. 
* Queenstown - the extreme sports capital of the world or something like that. Has it all - skiing, skydiving, bungee jumping, rafting, etc. 

**Animals**
  
* Featherdale Wildlife Park - Near Sydney, see above section. 
* Taronga Zoo - see Sydney section.
* Austrlaia Zoo - Up near Sunshine Coast, not familiar with it. 
  
**Cultural**  
  
* Melbourne - see food.   
* Uluru - Where Ayers Rock is. Great for the ""Outback"" experience. Can fly (3 hrs) from Sydney, not/nothing else there though. 
  
**Beaches/Relaxation**  
  
* Lord Howe Island - limited access island. Super exclusive. Best value is booking out and using Qantas points to get there. 16k or so round trip for $1,000 flight.   
* Hamilton Island - right off barrier reef's southern end. Beautiful islands with Whitsundays islands nearby.  
* Port Douglas - the nicer way to get to the Great Barrier Reef (as opposed to touristy/backpacker Cairns).  
* Bondi/Bronte/Coogee/etc. - Eastern beaches. All near Syndey. Bondi to Coogee walk will show you most of them.  
* Northern Beaches (30 - 45 min car ride from city). More laid back beaches outside of the city. Slower paces, friendlier locals. 

##Example Itinerary##
Assumes 10 days down under.
  
* Day 1 - Land in SYD, drop bags at hotel, change, and head straight to Zoo. DO NOT NAP. Try to stay awake until 7p or so. Good luck.
* Day 2 Sydney - Hop on/Hop off bus tour. Do Bondi to Coogee walk when you get to Bondi. Figure out what you like and don't like along the way.
* Day 3 Travel to Melbourne - Dinner downtown. 
* Day 4 Melbourne - Coffee, walk around CBD, Great Ocean Road maybe?
* Day 5 Travel to Queenstown, NZ
* Day 6 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 7 Queenstown - Outside
* Day 8 Travel to Sydney 
* Day 9 Sydney - Opera House tour. Ferry to Manly for lunch/afternoon. 
* Day 10 Depart Sydney

I just got into this point game last month when I applied for the Chase Reserve with the sole purpose of getting my family of 4 to Hawaii. I quickly started researching the Korean Air option at 25k per person RT. I went ahead and created my family Skypass account and used last years tax return for proof of relationships, easy peezy..seriously took 10 minutes out of my work day. I have been looking at alaskair.com for the last few weeks just trying to determine when a good time for us to go to HI would be and I settled on 21-27 Apr and easily found some flights on Delta: Route Summary: PHX-LAX-HNL 8hr total fly time works for me. Anywho, made the call to Korean Air this afternoon and let them know what dates I was looking for and was told to expect a call back within 24 hours. About 6 hours later I received a call from the same number I had earlier called and it was a Skypass rep. to complete the booking. A few minutes into the call he did have some computer issues, asked if he could call me back shortly and I agreed. 15 minutes later he called and after about 7 minutes on the phone my 4 tickets heading to HI are essentially booked. From here I sent in our photo IDs and birth certificates for my 2 children. Now it is just a matter of confirming everything and then transferring my 100k UR points when it comes time to ticketing.
Seriously at first reading the blogs did make it seem intimidating, especially since we usually can do everything behind our computer screen without talking to someone. All in all though I just wanted to say to someone that is a newb like me, don't be afraid of the Korean Air process, it works."
"2018-08-02 19:12:56"|"Trip Report: Singapore and Malaysia"|"Trip Report:
2 week Honeymoon in Singapore and Malaysia for wife and I

* ORD -> ICN (Seoul) -> SIN, J (Business) Class with Korean Air.  75K UR transferred to Korean Air per person plus $100 taxes each.  Our first 'lay-flat' experience and it was very nice.  Nice lounge in ICN.

* 3 nights at JW Marriot Singapore South Beach.  40K Marriott points per night.  Room was a bit small but was a lovely hotel.  Great breakfast spread in the lounge for us gold members.  Nice location.  We enjoyed touring Singapore.

* SIN -> BKI (Kota Kinabalu), Economy with Silk Air.  7500 miles each, MR transferred to Krisflyer.  Standard economy flight.  Miles beat cash for this intra-Asia flight, we wanted direct.

* 1 night at Le Meridien Kota Kinabalu.  8500 Starpoints for exec room.  Great location but currently undergoing much needed renovation, still probably one of the better accommodations in KK.  They did the rose petals and everything for our Honeymoon and the incredible personal service we had is probably the best I've had in my life at a non-luxury hotel.  The night market (Filipino style) right outside is a unique experience, super cheap awesome seafood.  

* 2 day 1 night hike of Mount Kinabalu with Via Ferrata coming down.  Probably the most surreal and thrilling experiences of my life.  Exhausting as well, more difficult than any of the six 14ers I've hiked in Colorado by far.  The Via Ferrata is the highest in the world and truly epic.  The Pendant Hut lodge is basic but what do you expect on a mountain?  This was booked with cash via River Junkie, all-inclusive.  Not cheap but so worth it for the experience.

* Another night at Le Meridien Kota Kinabalu, 8500 Starpoints for exec room.  Same great service and even rushed laundry service for us.  We were exhausted so just relaxed and enjoyed the free evening food/drinks and breakfast in the AM.

* BKI -> TWU (Tawau) booked via Malaysia Airlines with cash.  Cheap, standard ecomony flight.

* 4 nights at Scuba Junkie, Mabul Resort.  Paid cash, all-inclusive style on small island.  Accommodation is not luxurious but certainly adequate for the situation.  We got our PADI Advanced Open Water and dived at Sipadan Island, one of the best scuba locations in the world, apparently.  Great experience and would definitely stay and dive there again.  Sipadan is a special place.

* TWU -> KUL -> LGK (Langkawi).   Economy with Air Asia, cash.  No hitches.

* 3 nights at Ritz-Carlton Langkawi in Grand Oceanfront Villa.  228K UR points using CSR for 1.5 cpp.  Beautiful property and superb room and experience.  The most luxurious and splendid room I've ever stayed in.  We did the classic honeymoon stuff: spa, private pool, dinners, etc.  We did see a bit of the island, but we didn't really want to leave the room.  It's a big chunk of UR, but we indulged for our honeymoon.  

* LGK -> KUL -> SIN.  Economy with Malaysia Airlines.  First flight was delayed but we we able to make connection for our intercontinental flight.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy the lounges on this stretch due to timing and lounge location.  They lost one of our bags, which had to get routed to ORD about 4 days after we returned state-side.  Really the only hitch of the trip.

* SIN -> PVG (Shanghai) -> ORD.  J (Business) class with China Eastern.  95K MR each, transferred to Delta.  $225 taxes each, plus $100 MR transfer fee, which caught me off-guard.  Another awesome J experience, on par the with Korean Airlines flights.  Killer 2 story lounge at PVG with showers, recliners, massage chairs, that came in handy for the 7 hour layover.  

Overall, points-wise, this cost us:

378K Chase UR

190K Amex MR

120K Marriott Rewards Points

17K Starpoints

It was an amazing, once in a lifetime trip and all went according to plan.  Back to the real world, now.  

P2 and I have been moderately churning CCs for about 2 years now.  CIP x 2 (with referrals) and CSR x 2 were the big ones that got us the UR.  Biz Plat x 1 and Personal Plat x 1 were the major MR earners.  We still have loads of MR left, but time to up the points for another amazing trip!

We would like to split out time between Cape Town (3-4 nights) and on a Safari (3 or 4 nights). From what I have read, April would be a good time to go. We'd fly out of Chicago, so that gives us lots of options. Both of us are flooded with AA, Delta, UR and got a good amount of other points (200k MR (will earn more as the year goes on), 60k Avianca, 25k United)

My initial plan is fly QR there and back (or possibly EY Apartments one way). I know I can't book April yet, but my plan is to book it as soon as it's available. Our dates in April are 100% flexible.

1) I have found lots of availability for ORD-DOH-JNB in March, but can never find ORD-DOH-CPT. Does QR not fly direct from DOH to CPT?

2) If we have to fly in/out of JNB, is it better to just pay cash for flights from JNB to CPT?

3) Ideally, we'd like to not have to go back to JNB after CPT, what would be another good option to go from CPT back to ORD?

4) I know Safari lodges are hard on points. Any recommendations of places to stay using Marriott/Hilton points by Kruger? If we did that, can we just pay a company to pick us up/meet them and they do day drives in Kruger?

5) If we go non-Marriott/Hilton for Kruger, can anyone recommend some good places on the UR portal inside the park? Ideally all-inclusive with game drives.

6) Any other recommendations for Safaris/South Africa in general?"

I live in Southern California, and John Wayne Airport is the closest option for me.  I do fly LAX but only when I need to.  Since JWA isn't a major hub, I tend to fly different airlines.  I have 40-80k points on United, American, and Delta (each) and I don't think at this rate I'll ever get upgraded to first class or get free flights if I'm not doing things correctly.  I also have 60k points with Marriott.

I know I'm not traveling a ton, but I do go on 2-3 trips per month, so I figure that's enough that could add up.  

Can I convert points from one airline or hotel to another?

I'm thinking of consolidating and trying my best to only fly American.  Is this a good idea?

How do I make sure to maximize my benefits in the future?  Can I earn airline miles from my hotel stays and rental cars?

"2019-05-28 00:28:25"|"Feeling scammed... Miles and More woes. Any thoughts would be helpful"|"Hi there,

My husband and I have been saving miles for the past couple of years by using their MM credit card and other rewards points, the idea being to use them on booking our honeymoon. We currently have 110,00 miles, and FRA is our home airport, so Lufthansa's Miles and More seemed the way to go. We've finally got a chunk of time that we could use for a vacay, and we went to look at the flights,  with a destination of LAX in Aug/Sept.   

This is where our trouble began. LH wants 30,000 M + **490EUR pP ""Fees & Taxes""** for an economy flight. No business class available. 

This far out, I can book a flight with Delta for the same dates, cheaper and not using any miles. Or plenty of other airlines for comparable $$$ without using miles.   

We both feel like we have a bunch of useless miles that won't really take us anywhere without us having to spending cash that would be comparable to a fare and we're spending money for their upkeep by keeping their stupid MM credit card. Did we get bamboozled? Or is MM just shitty?"

**Learnings**

* Get your miles ASAP. I had been looking for HNL - SYD flights in J and I was contemplating splitting up people into different flights or fare class. One hazy night, I found 6 in J on the same flight. I booked it immediately, because I knew it was a unicorn. If I didn't have 390k AA in an account, one could've been snatched from me. Another example was that the [Australian call center](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-airlines-aadvantage/1738929-booking-aa-award-travel-etihad-ey-master-thread-july-2017-onwards.html) trick had ""closed"", meaning I thought I had another 4 months to accumulate miles. Welp, the loophole opened back up the next week and I had to scramble to do in a week what I thought I had 4 months to do.

* Do you research on how many premium award seats will get released. AUH to ORD on EY only has award J availability for 2. If you're waiting to get 6 seats, that's not going to happen. I got dinged for changing my destination to JFK.

* Keep some mystery on the things you're excited for. I had read too many trip reports on the Etihad First Class Apartment, I watched every YouTube video on it & interviewed people about their experience...so I knew every exact detail and set my expectations way too high that they'd never be met. I enjoyed it, but would've enjoyed it much more had there been mystery around it.

* I tried to avoid YQ like the plague, so that's why I chose some of the flights that I did. Probably should've been less of a miser there, but I think it worked out really well.

I made dreams come true & got a commemorative mug for it. Could I have used my miles more efficiently? Probably, but (KanyeShrug).

P.S. Obligatory thanks for the help, internet!

**Update 1**

**Tools I used**

* 7 or 8 months in advance, I would first look on Kayak to find routes & times that would be convenient.

* Then after I picked the top 3 routes & times, I would study the most efficient way to fly that route. Would it make sense to transfer points into that program or use a partner? Does one have YQ and the other not?

* From there, ExpertFlyer was incredibly helpful for looking for award availability. I started booking 6 months in advance. It gets easier once you get away from the US.

* I pretty much have this as my wallpaper [WellTraveledMile transferable points chart](https://welltraveledmile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Airline_Transfer_Partner_Guide_Airlines_Update_dec16.png)

* I am also part of meetups, FB groups, Slack channels, browse Reddit, went to FTU, read blogs and occasionally look at FT. People are REALLY helpful if you have an EXACT question. People hate it when you don't think for yourself & have to spoonfeed you answers.

**Taxes & Fees**

* (MSP - HNL) - DL Economy Comfort - $0 (booked via UR portal)*6 = $0

* (SEA - HNL) - DL J - $21.60

* (SYD - OOL) - 3 QF J & 3 QF Y - $15.90*6 = $95.40

* (OOL - SYD) - VA Y - $0 (booked via UR portal)*6 = $0

* (SYD - AUH) - 2 EY F & 4 EY J - $74.60*2 + $74.70*4 = $448

* (AUH - JFK) - 6 EY J - $49.16*6 = $294.96

**Total in fees for flights paid:** $1,042.36

Pics and review of IAH-NRT route"|"Bit of a backstory here: I never really intended to fly ANA F, but since I was prepping to close my Citi Premier card, I had to dump my TYP somewhere. As fortune would have it there was a 25% transfer bonus from Citi -> VS at the time and it left me with enough points to book F when normally I?d have just booked J. So I figured why not let?s compare the 2 cabins. This turned out to be a good thing since I wound up having to change the dates of the trip in January and when I went to rebook it only about 60 days in advance, there was zero J in sight on my route, limited F, but it was there for peak cherry blossom season.

All pictures and viewpoints are from the 777-300 and the IAH-NRT route. All window seats since I was traveling solo.

Here is the IMGUR album link, so follow along, I?ve posted the pics in the same order as the text. It would be a lot more user friendly if reddit would allow in line posting of images, but what can you do? Unless otherwise noted, F pics are on the left, J pics are on the right.

https://imgur.com/a/RvPu6


**Check in and departure at Houston** (no pics)

Sorry to combine this, but they?re the same in either class. While there is 1 dedicated F and 2 J check in counters, all were occupied when I arrived. Either way the wait was minimal and handled quickly, much like last year. ANA uses the United Club as their lounge which is unfortunate for many reasons, mainly because it isn?t very good. Until the IAH Polaris Lounge is ready, the Centurion Lounge remains the best lounge at IAH if you have a qualifying Amex card. I went to the UC to check it out since I had the time, but quickly left. The breakfast spread was weak and the lounge crowded. The CL has infinitely better food and better drinks. Not to mention it?s closer to gate D5, which is the one ANA uses at IAH. Even once the Polaris Lounge opens, I wouldn?t expect there to be any difference for ANA F vs. J since United is phasing out their own F cabin and Global First lounges.

**Check in and departure at Tokyo** (no pics)

The differences here are that F pax are allowed to use the Suites check in which is under the Z letter at NRT Terminal A. Biz pax have their own dedicated lanes in the normal area. F pax have a dedicated security checkpoint (I was the only person in it), while Biz have access to the Gold Track lane. Neither class has access to a dedicated immigration checkpoint, which IMO would have been more useful than a dedicated security checkpoint.

With an F BP, you get to use the ANA Suites lounge vs the biz class side. They are two sides to the same general area (walk in and take a left to go to biz, take a right to go to suites), the main differences being the Suites lounge is far less crowded and has a self serve buffet of hot food, which the biz doesn?t. One review of the Suites lounge I found online said it would be ?a fantastic business class lounge? which is a pretty fair summary since it lacks many of the traits of other top tier lounges, like table service for meals, spa amenities, etc. that you?d find in CX, EK lounges. Hell even AA now has table service Flagship First dining in LAX and JFK. (There are some pictures of the ANA Suites lounge below in the ANA vs JAL comparison I link to)

**The seat**

So first vs biz has long been summed up as seat and service are the real differences. So let?s address the seat. My thoughts: it?s very comfortable, it?s cloth, and while it?s wide, it isn?t anywhere near a crazy width (ala Cathay F), and the seat width is cannibalized by the 5ish inch arm rests on both sides of the seat. See the pic where I used Amex cards for a comparison! Now I?m not a big guy so I don?t terribly care, I fit just fine, I mention it because it got some discussion in the recent ANA J vs F comparison. I didn?t notice much of a difference in seat position vs J in width, but I did in comfort. The ANA F seat is like that comfy recliner you?d had for years, which kind of makes sense, this recliner has been flying around for about 5-6 years. Now this compares with Cathay F, which on the 777 has an absurd seat/bed width. But they also only do 3 across on their 777 in F. 

It?s worth mentioning that getting in and out of the F seat is easier because your pathway is about twice as wide as J.

**The bed**

This probably the biggest hard product advantages of F. As you can see the bed goes fully flat and the bed goes flush with the armrests which take up lot of the space in seated position. Also the footwell is much larger. The ANA I don?t really recall any difference in the quality of the sleep between J and F. As is usual with Asian airlines they kept the temperature a bit warmer than I?d prefer so I barely used the blanket and just had the pyjamas on. The PJs are also way better in F vs the ones I was given in J last year. They?re a lot more comfortable and fit better.

**Dining**

I?m not going to talk too much about this ? you can see the pictures. As the prior ANA comparison mentioned, there isn?t much of a difference between F and J as far as the menu goes, besides an extra appetizer course. The main difference is in the alcohol quality, Krug and Hibiki 21 in F, something lesser and Hibiki 17 in J. ANA?s catering is excellent in both cabins and I haven?t had anything disappointing in my 4 flights with them. Both cabins more or less share the same order on demand snack menu. 

You can view the menu for my flight, and any other ANA flight here: https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/serviceinfo/international/inflight/guide/f/meal/ scroll down and pick your departure city.

**Random musings**

IFE ? I felt that the IFE selections were kind of lacking for US/western tastes. Unless you like Star Wars, they had a shit ton of those movies available. 

Service ? I can?t say I?ve had a negative interaction with any ANA employee yet. They take great care of you, and at least appear to really enjoy their jobs! Their attention to detail is amazing though. On my return flight, one of the FAs who wasn?t the one who served me dinner, was wondering around with a different bottle of red wine from what I originally had. She already knew it wasn?t the one I had ordered, and encouraged me to try a glass of the other red. Part of me wondered if they somehow knew I liked to compare beverages since I had asked for a Hibiki 21 vs 17 comparison on the outbound flight. Also each time you ring the call button, they appear out from behind the curtains in only a few seconds. 


**Overall conclusions**

As far as booking, I can really only recommend F > J as long as the VS award chart lasts, and personally I think it?s ripe for getting ?enhanced? away. I don?t think there?s a single better value out there for true international first class, and when you think that Citi and Amex occasionally have transfer bonuses to further reduce the cost, I just think it?s too good to last. If you intend to take advantage I?d plan to do it sooner rather than later. The cost differential using United miles (220k r/t in F vs 160k in J) or ANA?s program (150k r/t F vs 75-90k J) is way too big to be worthwhile. Personally I?m not even sure I?d book F instead of J via VS unless there was a transfer bonus that allowed you to basically pay for J and get F. 

So where do these products rank for me? While ANA has an undoubtedly solid F product, it?s not the best I?ve flown. The ground service and lounge amenities are somewhat lacking, the hard product is a bit dated, I think this F cabin is unchanged since it came out at least 5-6 years ago. A friend flew ANA F from Japan to NYC from this same trip, he hadn?t flown it since 2013, and said nothing?s changed. Finally, while not an issue for me since I?m forever single, it?s not an ideal product for couples. What it makes up for is trademark fantastic Japanese service and excellent crew, very good food and booze, and a comfy seat and bed.

Personally I don?t think there would be anywhere as much hype about ANA F if it weren?t for the really good value of booking through VS, and the fact that Japan is an awesome place to visit. I?m not trying to belittle ANA F, it?s just that I think the largest failing ANA F is only incrementally better than J. The meals are mostly the same, both cabins have all aisle 1-2-1 access, and the ground experience is almost the same. 

Emirates still takes the #1 spot for me, Cathay follows at #2, and ANA now at #3. But let?s talk J products. ANA is 1st in my long-haul J ranking, followed by Virgin Australia in #2, Delta?s A350 in #3, AA at #4, and Thai in a distant #5. 

Up on the travel docket for the rest of the year as far as new products go, assuming no changes, are QF J, TG F, CX J, and JL J, all in one wacky trip. Of those I?m most excited for TG F on the 747 and JL J. 

**Another resource to look at ANA F**

I didn?t write this comparison, but a user on Flyertalk posted this comprehensive comparison of ANA F vs JAL F. I haven?t yet flown JAL F, so I personally can?t attest to the conclusions, but I don?t disagree with any of his opinions about ANA. https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trip-reports/1857800-comparing-jal-ana-first-class-better.html


**NRT vs HND**

I see lots of people online talk up the superiorness of HND because it?s closer. On this trip I finally had a chance to use HND for a domestic flight (ANA Y, which I haven?t covered here, if you have any questions feel free to ask away).

Fun fact about domestic flights in Japan, there are no liquids restrictions, so you can carry your water bottle through security. Beer would probably be cool too, given Japan?s lack of laws prohibiting open containers of alcohol. 

Ok yeah it?s closer to downtown, but damn does the monorail get crowded around rush hour time, and you?re still probably going to need to transfer from the monorail or the Keisei line to another subway or JR line to get your destination. I still like the NEX train because you?re guaranteed a seat, which isn?t necessarily true on either transit line to HND, there is free and fairly fast WIFI, and if you are staying in the main areas of Tokyo like Shinjuku or around Tokyo Station, you don?t have to transfer lines.

Question for those in the know: 

Which is the better option for top tier? AA or Delta? 

The things that matter to me (and maybe others) most are: (1) Service: Starting from booking right through to the gate and on the flight. (2) Ability to use upgrades earned for at least ?J? flights on descent aircraft. (3) On-time departures and arrivals.

Thank you so much for your feedback!

My partner is DM and we planned to use his international first class upgrades to get the fancy new suites going from ATL to ICN. But turns out the suite takes two upgrade points (really, Delta?) and as he only has four we wouldn?t be able to get a suite round trip. (Also want to mention that we wouldn?t be guaranteed a suite, we?d be on the waiting list). We decided to go ?premium economy? round trip, as they only require one upgrade.

But now I?m regretting that decision. We?re traveling the first two weeks of December which is a low travel time as most people wait until Christmas or New Years. I?m wondering if we should try for the suite on the way there, and hope the plane is so empty on the way back we can get a row to ourselves in economy. The plane currently looks pretty empty.

I travel really poorly, I?m really only able to sleep in the Delta One beds. I don?t want to get to Seoul so jet lagged I have to spend an entire day getting over it. But the thought of spending 15 hours in economy seat sounds just miserable. But would ?premium economy? really be any better?

I had this crazy idea about traveling in the year 2020 around a  festival/event theme: going to places with some of the more interesting cultural festivals/events around the world.  The tentative schedule I've put together:

&#x200B;

Tuna throwing festival in Port Lincoln, Australia: January 26

Snow festival in Sapporo, Japan: February 3 - 10 (EDIT: now thinking of dropping this in favor of the Olympics in July/August in Tokyo)

Battle of the Oranges in Ivrea, Italy: February 22 - 25

Chiditarod in Chicago, USA: March 7

Calcio Storico in Florence, Italy: semifinals in early June, final is on June 24

Euro 2020 football (soccer) tournament throughout Europe: June 12 to July 12

EDIT: Now looking at adding in the Tokyo Olympics in early August and then the Fringe festival in Edinborough in mid August

La Tomatina in Bunol, Spain: August 26

International Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque, USA: October 3 - 11

Dia de Los Muertos, Mexico City (or Oaxaca), Mexico:  November 2

Cayman Pirates Week, Grand Cayman: mid November

&#x200B;

So I can't just travel the whole year, but there are some distinct trips that I feel like I could build with this agenda.  I'm thinking:

&#x200B;

**Trip 1**

January 19ish: fly to Melbourne and go to the Australian Open.  One of my bucket list items is to attend all 4 tennis grand slams...so far I've done the US and the French.  If I'm going to Australia in January anyway, this seems like a no brainer.  I've been to Australia before but only Sydney and Cairns.

January 25: fly over to Port Lincoln and attend the tuna throwing festival

January 27: Fly to New Zealand.  I've never been and it's high on my list.

February 7ish: Fly to Sapporo and attend the closing couple days of the snow festival.  Maybe I could spend a few more days in Japan...not sure where else I'd go in Winter.  I've been to Tokyo and Kyoto before.  EDIT: Now thinking of dropping this out of the trip and heading straight from New Zealand to Rome.

February 11ish: Fly to Rome, which I've been to before but it's been 20 years.  Head down to southern Italy which I've never been to before.

February 21ish: Head up to Ivrea which is near Turin and attend the Battle of the Oranges.

February 26ish (or maybe I spend a bit more time in Europe): Fly home to Chicago.

March 7th: Attend Chiditarod.

&#x200B;

**Trip 2**

Mid May: Fly to Europe.  Hit up some places I'd like to go: Switzerland (never been), Paris (would love to go back to the French Open), Venice (never been).  Then go to the Calcio Storico in Florence for the semifinals in early-ish June (dates TBA).  Then on to a group stage Euros match

Mid June: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

**Trip 3**

EDIT: Now thinking of flying to Tokyo in early August for the Olympics then heading to Edinborough for the Fringe Festival before proceeding on to Spain.

August 23ish: Fly to Spain.  Work my way over to Bunol for La Tomatina on the 26th.  Then head North and potentially explore non-Paris France (never been), Belgium (never been), the Netherlands (I've been to Amsterdam 20 years ago).

Late September: Fly back to Chicago.

&#x200B;

The rest of the events at the end of the year are straightforward flights in/out within North America/Caribbean.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking that I will want to use miles for:

USA to Australia (business)

New Zealand to Japan (business)

Japan to Italy (business)

Italy to USA (economy)

USA to Europe in May (business)

Europe to USA in June (economy)

USA to Europe in August (business)

Europe to USA in September (economy)

&#x200B;

Everything else I think I could just pay cash.

&#x200B;

So of course all these dates are too far out to check for award availability.  But I'd like to talk through my options and what is likely to be available to see if I can pull this off or if I need to make adjustments.  Here's my miles/points stash:

Amex: 95K

Merrill Lynch: 28K

Alaska: 137K (will soon get add'l 40K bonus)

American Airlines: 124K

BA: 6.5K

Delta: 35K

Southwest: 36K

United: 43K (though I suspect I'll need to use 30K for travel in May 2019)

Choice: 8K

Hilton: 47K

Hyatt: 57K

IHG: 20K

Radisson: 119K

Wyndham: 20K

&#x200B;

I've done a little bit of proof of concept award travel search seeing if I could find the awards I need if I was doing this trip in 2019 instead of 2020.  I had success with everything except how to get to Australia with business class.  Of course I am searching just a month and a half out for Australia so that may be why there's no availability.  Here was my tentative plan for paying for this stuff with points.

&#x200B;

USA to Australia (business): I'm not sure how to crack this one because business class award availability to Australia is so tough.  Using Alaska miles to fly Cathay through Hong Kong seems like the most likely option?  If I ended up having a stopover for a couple of days in Hong Kong that would be totally cool as I've never been there before.  I really don't know if availability will be there for January 2020 if I start searching in February 2020.  Unfortunately, this is when I am least flexible in terms of timing: January is my busiest work time of year.  I'm going to work like the dickens the first 2 weeks of January 2020 to put as much to bed as possible but I really can't leave the USA in those first 2 weeks.

New Zealand to Japan (business): Looks like I can do this for just 40K AA miles.  There's availability for this in 2019 on Malaysian Air so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Japan to Italy (business): Can do this for 75K AA miles. There's availability for this in 2019 on BA so I'd hope there'd be availability in 2020.  I was worried the YQ surcharges would be really bad but it's only $200.

Italy to USA (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in May (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in June (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex.  I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

USA to Europe in August (business): Could do for 55K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

Europe to USA in September (economy): Could do for 30K Aeroplan points transferred from Amex. I see availability in 2019 so I hope there'd be availability in 2020.

&#x200B;

So I need 95K more Amex points but I figure I can find a way to make that happen.

&#x200B;

**My Questions**

1. Are there any great festivals I'm missing?  I considered Carnivale in Brazil or Mardi Gras in New Orleans, but I'm really just not sure the former is for me, and in any case this Battle of the Oranges seemed too cool to miss.  Though maybe I'm doubling up on that sort of thing if I'm going to La Tomatina.  I've been to Oktoberfest or that would be on the list for sure.  I suppose I could still go back during my Aug/Sep Europe trip.
2. Is there a better way to spend award points to make this trip come together?  Or credit cards I can get to get some points I need to do this better?  I'm way over 5/24.
3. Getting to Australia especially: I'm really concerned that I won't find availability on Cathay with Alaska miles in the tight window I will be looking and then I'm screwed.  Ideas?

&#x200B;

I appreciate everybody's help and sorry for such a long post.

SIN-JFK(via FRA) | SQ | Suites | Layover
JFK-MSP | Delta | Y | 0



Do I stick with Bali or swap Bali with Japan and move Japan as our first destination? Points aren't an issue, as my CX flight would be replaced with JAL (probably in First) since Japan is Asia 1 compared to HKG (Asia 2) for AA Partner flights.

Food is a huge selling point but relaxation with beaches is right up there.

Spent like 5 hours today trying to understand different stopover/open jaw policies and trying to figure out different regions, and having a lot of trouble and would prefer help. If you have the best route set up for us, I am willing to give you 3 months of gold :)



**Basic details:**


Departure city is either SFO or OAK.


**3 Destinations:**

Japan, Tokyo or Kyoto (10 days)

Seoul (3 days)

Maldives 10 days (OR Bangkok/Ko Phi Phi, but Maldives is significantly more preferred)


Japan and Seoul can be flipped, but would like last destination to be Maldives (or Thailand). We prefer it to be Maldives, but if you cannot make it work, then Thailand would be the alternative.


**Dates:**


Departing July 1st from SFO or OAK.
Departing Final City (maldives or thailand) for arrival ON July 24.


**Points available:**


**Me:**

* United: 20,000 (Gold member, so wider availability of awards)
* Delta: 40,000
* American: 150,000
* SPG: 73,000
* Chase UR: 235,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* AMEX MR: 145,000  (transferable to a lot of airlines)


**Wife:**

* United: 12,000
* American: 64,000
* SPG: 40,000
* Chase UR: 28,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)
* CapitalOne: 15,600
* Amex MR: 103,000 (transferable to a lot of airlines)


How can we make this work? Could really use some guidance. 

Ideal parameters: maximize stopover rules, saver awards ONLY preferred (but if no availability, might have to suck it up), would prefer business class for Departing flight from SFO/OAK.

All this information has been really helpful and I am thinking about cutting out SYD/AKL/ZQN for a later trip. That will allow us more time in each city within SE Asia. 

Another note, I have family in HKG and have been there multiple times (sorry, didn't mention earlier). We may not need more than 3 days in HKG. I would rather experience the new cultural experiences with her than to relive HKG while everything is brand new to her.

I apologize for bombarding this sub. I am constantly looking for ideas and reading everyone's experiences gets me all hyped up.

I think I have narrowed down my SE Asia Honeymoon in the summer of 2018. My plan is to take about 3-4 weeks depending on how my PTO pans out. Here is the tentative plan at the moment. Looking to spend about 3-5 days per location starting with HKG.

MSP - JFK - HKG - CNX - HAN or SGN - DPS - SYD or AKL or ZQN

My initial plan was to fly one way on J on CX from JFK - HKG with my AA miles (70k per person). But I have just started reading about ANA and their J class, along with the fact they offer stop overs? Correct me if I'm wrong. ANA also run about 80-90k in J ROUND TRIP which would be huge if we can get some sort of stopover in there as well. Would you use the MR or use AA based on product (CX vs ANA vs something else)?

Right now I'm trying to piece together a surprise trip with a relative of mine to Japan. It's a dream destination for them, and I'm hoping to make at least one 'aspirational' redemption since they typically haven't experienced much beyond economy travel through-and-through, particularly for flights.

---

**Here's what I'm shooting for:**

* Get us ~10 days in Japan during Spring 2019, inclusive of flights and hotel, and preferably in and around Tokyo; this can include a stopover for a few nights on the way. Incorporating Kyoto is a plus but not mandatory.
* Preference for business or first class travel in one direction; no strong preference for the other (is it better to do this at the beginning or end of a trip?). Just want to give my relative the experience of a higher class of travel.
* Minimize cash spend, though I'm comfortable spending some towards hotels or flights if the added flexibility unlocks particularly good redemptions.
* Pretty flexible outside of these parameters.

---

**Here's the relevant points/miles at my disposal:**

**Transferrable:**

* UR: ~320K
* MR: ~300K
* TY: ~6K (earning another 10k in June)
* BofA Merrill+: ~50k

**Hotel:**

* Starpoints/Marriott: ~50k/150k (earning another ~20k/60k in June), plus a 7-night Cat 1-5 certificate (can upgrade for 30k per additional Category above 5)
* IHG: ~90k, plus one free night certificate available at the time of travel

**Airlines:**

* Asia Miles: ~70k (Earning another ~20k in June)
* Alaska: ~150k
* Delta: ~50k (Earning another ~70k in April)

---

Presently, I'm considering using my Alaska miles to grab Cathay Pacific Business (50k o/w) and/or First (70k o/w) tickets with a stopover in HK, and then using Delta miles for economy or premium economy flights in the other direction (shockingly, to me at least. I see readily available 35k/45k one-way economy/premium economy on Delta to travel between Boston and Tokyo). As for the hotel, I figure I can redeem 90k Marriott points with my 7-night certificate for a Category 8 hotel in Tokyo, and pair this with the IHG free night certificate and points to cover a few days in Hong Kong.

...This *seems* like a pretty efficient use of points to me, and certainly hits high cpp on paper, but I'm looking for advice mostly to make sure I'm not glossing over opportunities to enhance the trip further or realize solid value. I have little experience making these sorts of redemptions to date.

Thanks much!"

We received a few nicer things- meals, amenity kit on one leg, and a pillow for the flight. But the seat was a very basic economy seat and I was a little upset about that. The lady who was sat next to me on the flight to IST seemed so upset (speaking in French so I couldn?t understand everything) she left the plane!

I was just wondering if it would be worth my time to complain and try to get some miles back? Or just leave it be?

ETA- thanks for the helpful responses. I realize this was my fault for not researching more, but at least I know now. This was only one leg of a much longer business flight and I did make sure my 11 hour flight was a lay flat so at least I looked into one flight! When I looked at this one it showed a 2-2 configuration so I assumed incorrectly. I know for the future."

We went to Turks and Caicos in January and just came back from Hyatt Zilara Cancun 2 days ago. Dominican Republic and Jamaica are not destinations that we are interested in. I was thinking Antigua, Bahamas, Aruba but am open to suggestions. We are 32y.o. and would like to have some fun, meaning it will be nice to have some clubs around the resort or in the resort. 

Flying from NYC (JFK). Primary airline is Delta. So a direct Delta flight will be best. 

I was thinking to go back to Cancun because we loved it but if we can go somewhere else that will make her really happy because who doesn't like checking out new places. 

I have 70k UR and CSR. The rest will be cash. 
30k SPG
2 free nights from Hyatt
180k Delta miles but saving those for a Europe trip in biz. 
250k MR that will probably be covering the flights for this trip. I love my Biz Platinum. 


Let me know if you have some suggestions. Thank you in advance!"

Thinking about taking a quick mileage run in December to put me over the threshold into Diamond as I know I won't ever come anywhere close to hitting the MQD spend or the spend waiver for Diamond status going forward.

I usually fly about 70k butt-in-seat miles a year for work and maybe 10k or so for pleasure so requalifying for Plat with little to no rollover MQMs shouldn't be an issue. Part of me wants to keep ~45k MQMs to roll over into next year so I don't have to stress requalifying for Platinum but this may be my only chance to hit Diamond so it's got me thinking.

"2016-11-27 01:54:54"|"Would you pay quite a bit more to buy tickets from your main alliance?"|"Both my wife and I are Platinum level on oneworld, mainly because we live near an American Airlines hub. She travels a lot for work and I try to get her to use one world whenever possible, but sometimes she will pick Southwest or Delta just because it is more convenient. That's fine. It's her life. But right now we are looking at summer vacation tickets to Europe. The one world Alliance tickets are extremely expensive at the moment. Perhaps they will drop, especially since the euro is doing poorly against the dollar, and of course the airlines are raking in record profits, but on the other hand they may not drop the prices if they can sell them for these exorbitant prices.

There are some other airlines which are a few hundred dollars cheaper to our destination, such as Icelandair and the Portuguese airline TAP. But they have some drawbacks in terms of the itinerary , and also we would be losing quite a few miles. Now the important thing about having miles for me is keeping my status, because I like having the free main cabin extra seats , as well as boarding first and all that other crap. I rarely used my miles for award tickets, although we have and it has saved us a lot of money. So I'm wondering whether should pay perhaps 200 or $300 more per ticket to fly with one world then with one of these non Alliance Airlines, like Delta or Swissair. Is it really worth a few hundred dollars to get those extra mile points? I'm not one of those people who are good at valuing miles per dollar and all that, so any advice you could give me would be appreciated!"

"2015-08-19 08:06:30"|"How to book AA/AS awards using Avios"|"
There are enough confusion about using Avios that it screams out for a quick guide.  Note, this is not a comprehensive guide on how to maximize your value, but only a short guide that describes how to search for awards, and use Avios to book travel.

Avios is the points program from British Airways.  You can earn Avios by flying on BA or their partner airlines, using the Chase BA credit card, or transfer points from UR, MR, or SPG.

What makes Avios really useful, is that it is a distance based program.  This means that the number of Avios you need for a trip is based on the flight distance.  Any non-stop trip shorter than 650 miles one way, will only cost 4500 Avios one way. This is a fantastic deal when compared to standard award cost of 12.5k miles from AA/AS/UA/DL.

One thing about Avios award, is that multi-stop awards are priced as multiple awards.  So a 1 stop connecting flight now cost you two awards, one for each leg traveled.  So when looking for Avios awards, you really want to stay with non-stop flights.

When flying inside US, you can use Avios to book AA and AS awards.  BA partners with AA as part of One World alliance, and partner with AS separately.  This means for AS and AA flights on their own metal, if there are Saver level awards, you can book them with Avios.

When searching for AA awards, you should first go to the BA website and create an Executive Club account.  Once you login, you can access BA's award search tool, and use it to find AA awards.  This works most of the time unless there is an IT glitch.  If you can find the AA award you want, you can book that directly with BA online, and The website will show you the number of Avios you need for the award.

However, BA.com does not show AS awards.  So if you want to include AS as an option, you have to use AA.com, which does show AS awards.  Now, when you search on AA.com, you will see that AA wants 12.5k AA miles for the award.  You can ignore this, as you are just using the website to search for the award.  Once you find the award seat you want, write down the date, time, and flight number, and CALL BA reservations.  Tell them you want to book an award flight on AS, and give them the info.  The CSR should be able to find and book the award for you, charging the correct Avios for the award.  Also, there should not be a phone booking fee, as this award cannot be booked online.

Note, you can also use alaskaair.com to search for AS awards, but you have to be careful.  AS would also show awards on flights operated by other partners, such as Delta, but you can't book those awards using Avios.  Using AA.com means any award is available to AS partners to book.

"2017-12-08 23:38:31"|"Hawaii Trip"|"I know there are a lot of posts about Hawaii...so here?s another one!

My fianc? and I are getting married in April 2018. We're planning a delayed honeymoon - probably August - October timeframe. Our leading candidate for destination is Hawaii. I've spent the past few days researching all the different ways to get there with points. I have the following points: 260k UR, 130k MR, 40k United, 120k SW, 70k JetBlue, 140k Hilton, 130k Marriott, 80k SPG.

I realize that the cheapest way to get there with points is probably transferring to Korean Air. However, I think I want to book the tickets before we're actually married and I know they have restrictions on that. I know there are a few other cheap options (Air France, British Airways, etc.) but I would really like to fly at least one way in first class. It seems like the best first class going to Hawaii is on Hawaiian Airlines. If we're not flying first class, I would at least like a plane with 2-X-2 seating. I believe that leaves either a 767 or A330. All of Hawaiian's flights appear to be on an A330 with 2-4-2 seating. The only reasonable option I see for a 767 is Delta metal booked through Air France but the availability is a pretty iffy. Also, I'm thinking of using the UR points on hotels. It doesn't seem like MR points transfer as well to hotels.

This is the itinerary I came up with and points/cost for each leg.

* TPA > JFK on JetBlue (Coach for 7.3k or $119 per Person)

* JFK > HNL on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First 80k MR Points per Person)

* HNL > OGG on Hawaiian ($73 per Person - I will try to see if I can get the Amex Plat Reimbursement on these.)

* OGG > SFO on Hawaiian (Lie-Flat First $567.33 per Person)

* SFO > FLL on JetBlue (Mint for 33.7k or $449 per Person)

* FLL > TPA on Southwest (8k or $134 per Person)


Total:

* 73.8k JetBlue (for 2 People w/10% Credit from JetBlue Plus Card) ~1.84 cents/point

* 160k MR Points (for 2 People) ~2.09 cents/point

* 16k SW Points ~1.67 cents/point

* $1,280.66 (for 2 People)


Am I being crazy with all of this? Should I just book round trip with Air France or British Airways and likely get stuck in a middle site for 5+ hours?"

Not totally sure yet) and am looking to (if it makes sense) commit to an airline and hotel chain for both personal and business travel. I had previously had Amtrak status and all that but was thinking flying might be easier with the frequency of travel increasing. I'm open to getting a new CC or two if that makes sense too.

Here are some details that I think are helpful:

* Will be completing all business bookings on a corporate card
* Can fly out of LGA or JFK and into DCA or IAD, no preference either way
* Chase Sapphire Reserve is the main travel/restaurants card I use for personal expenses currently. Spouse and I earned \~110,000 points on it last year, anticipate it to be similar this year
* Personal travel is mostly to CLT and PBI, but would like to also consider LAX and \~2 international trips a year in the future

Airline Thoughts

* Lately have been flying JetBlue for personal travel since they have the 1:1 points transfer. I also really like their pooling option, it's been helpful for personal travel. However, it doesn't seem like they have a good direct NYC to DC option
* My company has a corporate partnership with Delta that gives priority for things like boarding, seating, medallion upgrades, standby, and service recovery
* I've had bad luck with United and American in the past and tend to shy away from it, but am open-minded if there's a good case for them

Hotel Thoughts

* There's basically every type of hotel near where I'll be: Marriott, Hilton, Ritz, etc. Most people I work with seem to be in the SPG game so I'm assuming that's what makes sense for me, but I'm open to others

Southwest has been nothing but great for me and my wife. There has literally been zero complaints on any of our travel with Southwest. It just seems like Delta is the ""big boy"" airlines and provides more options in destinations and upgrades.

I travel around 40K to 50K miles a year from Austin, TX.

If I do make the switch, I'll of course get the AMEX Delta CC to aid in the points and replace my Southwest CC.

We have a couple kids, so if we plan a vacation we tend to plan one internationally rather than domestic just because time away is few and far between. Southwest adding Hawaii in 2018 is definitely a plus, but the idea of an actual first class trip somewhere with Delta (plus the Sky Club during layovers) sounds pretty great, too.

I'm not here to sling some websites or blog launch (although commendable and goodluck TCK), just to share a little knowledge and to make sure people are actually redeeming your GotDam points. Much like the Tahiti post, credit knowledge focuses on budget and upstart churners with low MSQs but should be relevant to the 5/24+  who are happy to make one/2 trip to the PO/WM.

**If Under 5/24:** 

Southwest RR Plus card: 40k-50k bonus (Start with Plus, so when you need premier say you want no Foreign transaction fees, etc)

Good but high MS: Chase sapphire preferred/reserve. 50k Bonus (some say reserve is on it way to increase soon) People have different reasons for taking which one first, but as a budget guide, I say preferred for the waived AF.

**Over (and some under) 5/24 people:**
If you're here I'm assuming you prob have a little smattering of UR, Delta, United, etc floating around, so the redemptions will be cheap options from the card game gambit.



*Marriott Bonus*: 100k Points (5k/3m)- Decent Non - AI redemptions

*IHG Bonus*: 80k Points (1k/3m)- Decent Pricing this summer due to HALF OFF many Mexican AI and standard redemption. Low Min spend, Low AF (Annual Fee, not: as fuck)

*SPG* - Lets be real, we dont wanna waste these, but with nights as low as 4k we will consider it.

*Hyatt Bonus*: 2 Free Nights (2k/3m)- Hands down best card, can be used for AIs (I know these intro bonus nights are so valuable but this place is still a pretty penny at about 380+ a night)

*Choice:* Decent Cheap offerings when transferring from MR.

**PLACES:**

***CABO:***

**Hyatt Ziva**- 20k UR, All inclusive resort . Pretty swanky as far as cabo goes. Quasi four star resort.

**Holiday Inn Los Cabos** - 17.5k IHG (MAY-JUNE 2017) THIS IS THE ABOSOLUTE BEST DEAL FOR ANY ALL INCLUSIVE RESORT. THIS IS SOLID 3 STAR ACCOMMODATIONS WITH DECENT AI PERKS. A must try for beginning churners to get a taste of AI since the 80k + 5k IHG promo nets you nearly 6 nights at an AI (3 without the promo). Don't expect luxury, just a cheerful, basic AI experience. Book before May 7 for the half off deal. Great Cash + pts options too.


**Hyatt Place** - 5k UR, Budget but solid hotel. Not ideal for leisure, as there is no beach service and the beach is across the street, but great for a measly 5k UR. Great place to stay when booking a day tour or 
planning a city day.


***CANCUN:***

**Hyatt ZIVA/ZILARA** - 25k UR, All inclusives. Zilara is the adults only resort and is priced slightly higher than the Ziva. However, the Ziva and TURQUOISE Tower (the Ziva's adult section) is much newer and the rooms and facilities are much nicer--however reports say that Zilara has better quality dining with more upscale liquor/beer options (despite the ziva's onsite microbrewery).

**Intercontinental Presidente Resort** - 15k IHG (MAY-JUNE 2017): If youre not into All inclusives, this is a decent product at a discount. The resort shows some age, but the rooms (with assumed status/preffered/paid upgrades) hold up very well and Merritts the Intercontinental namesake . It is right near the downtown/nightlife area if Cancun (if youre into that). Passable beach and pool, nothing jaw dropping--as comes with this territory. Great Cash + pts options.

**Aloft Cancun** - 4k SPG, This is a great transit hotel if youre getting in from a late flight and dont want to spend many points for that first night. Note: Big with the budget Spring Breaker crowd. Also good if youre planning a day tour to Chitzen itza or Tulum, as these trips typically take all day.


***PUERTO VALLARTA:***

**Hyatt Ziva** - 20k UR, There's not much that stands out at this AI. Its on the low end Hyatt Ziva product line. It is still a very solid 3.5star resort in a great location. I don't recommend this place, for the hyatt free night redemption, but almost passable value for UR if you like AI

**Holiday Inn Express** - 10k IHG (MAY-JUNE 2017) , Not a resort nor a leisure hotel nor on the beach. But for 10k Measly IHG pts, its worth a mention. Younger travelers will gravitate to the nature expeditions in the area, where you can pretend to be a backpacker for over a week by exploring the old town and then after zipline though some trees and shit.

**CasaMagna PV:** 30k Marriott, For those with the supreme luxury of reaching the 100k bonus no prob, this is a decent place with all the digs. Great non AI option for resort seekers, but very low cpp when compared with off season rates and other great 30k options exist across the world. 

**FLIGHTS:**

This guide is really a home run for flyers out of the Los Angeles reigon. As redemptions from LAX to any of  these 3 destinations are as low as 8.5k rt. 

For my early churners..this is why the SWRR card is so crucial. These three cities are great values when flying with SW. Use the SW direct site to browse point costs.


Other origins will not be as forgiving, also finding redemptions on your favorite network will be a greater challenge than the SW portal.

Examples- Round trips as low as:

DFW--->SJD, CUN, PVR = 15k Avios

BOS--->CUN = 20k Avios

DEN---> SJD, CUN, PVR =25k AA , 16k RR

SEA---> SJD, PVR = 30k AA, 12k RR

ATL---->CUN = 17k RR

YMMV. But for max value USE SWRR. 

**ACTIVITIES:** 

Okay, lets say you book one of those 5k or 10k hotels. Chances are you are not at a resort sitting on a nice beach with staff that will bring you drinks. Hell, you gotta pay for breakfast at these places if you don't have Status perks. But no...youre the ""off the beaten path"" traveler. 

Off campus types will enjoy the mass amounts of cultural tours.  For Example: Cancun offers tours to Chitzen Itza and many great ones are on UR. Saw a report that was transpo shuttle, site admission fee, guided tour, mayan buffet lunch, and a swim at a cenote (seasonal) for 5k UR. 

More experienced travelers might also consider renting car. A cheap Mexican market hyundai or nissan runs about 10 bucks a day. Expect a charming 5 speed manual transmission and minimal safety features. More premiums models like a VW Jetta or SUVs run 20-30 USD. A great deal if you have proper licencing and records. This is my favorite option in Mexico because past the Zona Hoteleras are the best parts of Mexico,also Uber is sparce outside the zones. Book though your favorite portal. 

**CONCLUSION:**

Included in this guide are just the budget, easily attainable, or low cost highlights of the deep abyss that is the Mexican resort game.   You guys probably already know alot of this stuff but I think its useful to get it in writing. Im sure there's much more to add but I wanted to get this post out FAST as a PSA due to the great options that IHG has that ends this week. 

The core of this write up was to get early churners started on a path, and get experienced churners REDEEMING on the lower point budget with a decent cpp.

Again....no blog pushing, referral links, nor bamboozle. Just dropping some insights for anyone willing to read.

Cheers.

PS:
More experienced people: please chime in on how your tours booked though UR went!!

I'm looking to fly from NYC to either EZE, GRU, or GIG on 12/26, then flying back from one of the remaining two (which I didn't fly into) on 1/5. I know these are peak dates, but if anyone has any tips on good redemptions or availability, I have:

Economy, business, or first- doesn't matter to me...

I saw AA has availability on JFK-EZE on 12/26 for 30k in economy but can't find anything coming back from GIG or GRU. I presume it would be another 30k coming back. I prefer, if possible, to keep both the outbound and inbound flights on the same ticket so it can be more easily cancelled if needed, though this isn't absolutely necessary."
"2015-07-25 19:13:19"|"FAQ: US - Japan"|"As I put the finishing touches on my April 2016 LAX - Japan trip, I decided to write a little something something to help others and myself place this popular award travel dream into perspective. The following will set clear some questions that come up a lot both on this subreddit and /r/churning. By no means am I an avid award traveler. This is mostly from my research/FME. No loyalty to an airliner is regarded.

These are some Frequently Asked Questions regarding award travel to Japan from the US. These start very basic and then get a bit more complicated.



**1.) What is the most efficient way to get to Japan from the US via award travel?**

Definitely American Airlines AAdvantage Miles. 

One-way award seats at 25k (off-peak),50k, 62.5k miles for econ, business, first are difficulty to beat. Especially when the competition usually charges high fees. Plus, you earn 10% back on points if you have an AA Aviator Red, Aviator Silver, Platinum Select, Executive credit card open.



**2.) Where are all the US - Japan award flights on AA.com? They are not showing up!**

Many (all?) partner flights do not even show up AA.com. Search on British Airway's (start here), Qantas', or Japan Airlines' award reservation system. Note the flight #. Call AA's reservation line @ 1-800-882-8880. Make sure to tell them the flight is not visible on aa.com, but you know for a fact it exist and is available. The CS rep. should waive the phone booking fee because of this comment.



**3.) I still do not see award flights on the BA/Qantas/JAL award reservation system. How can I get the flight I want?**

Well they obviously exist. Please note that availability is quite low, especially for the business and first class seats. You may have to book close to 11 months in advance to be sure you get the ticket on the dates you want.

Some have had luck booking flights weeks/days before departure. Sometimes additional reward seats are released close to departure. Huge YMMV here. So good luck.



**4.) I do not have enough AA miles and cannot churn to the needed AA miles (for X reason). I got loads of United and Delta points though. What are some of my options?**

United will charge 70k miles for a round-trip award ticket. [Further breakdown regarding partners and ticket type here.](http://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx) Expect much higher fees with United compared to AA. United's reservation system will show most all partnered award flights.

Sorry IDK shit about Delta :D. All I know is its possible. Delta's reservation system will show a decent amount of partnered award flights, and Delta miles are not as efficient as the competition.



**5.) I want to see much of Japan. How much are Japan Domestic flights?**

British Airways will charge 4,500 miles plus a $2 fee for one-way JAL domestic flights. You can travel between major cities via The Bullet Train...



**6.) I want to see much of Japan. Is The Bullet Train worth using when on budget compared to British Airways short haul flights? What is the JR pass and what are its key limitation? How can I get it for free?**

Yes, the Bullet Train (Shinkansen) is worth it if you get the JR pass. The passes start at 29,110 Yen (currently this is $234.02 on 21/7/2015) for the seven day option. 

The JR pass key limitation that we care about is the fact that it can only be bought when outside of Japan and can only be bought my tourists. There are many rules and limitations, but it is still worth. I've read that the Green JR Pass is not worth for the typical tourist.

[Please read through all the rules here.](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/) There are many ways to use the pass and it would be unfortunate to realize a specific thing you wanted to use it for is not allowed.

You can get it for free by redeeming points/""miles"" against the charge. Like on the Arrival +, Cap1 Venture, or other credit cards of the like. Sign-up bonuses for these cards are higher than the cost of the JR pass.

*The JR Pass will code as Tourist Attaction on the Arrival +. You will have to call to get the charge erased with your points. We don't know how the recent changes to the Arrival + effected this option.



**7.) What about award stays at hotels? Any recommendations?**

Redeeming the two free nights [from this Chase sign-up bonus](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/hyatt-card.aspx) at the Park Hyatt Tokyo is a very popular option around here. Book ahead since availability is killer.

The SPG Sheraton in Osaka is an extremely cheap points option @4k points a night.

Cannot go wrong with AirBnB. Japanese hospitality is highly regarded. The host may really help you out here. Statement credit points/miles can be used to cover AirBnB charges.



**8.) What sort of awards can I redeem if I want to fly Singapore Airlines? Should I redeem through United or Singapore if I have the option?**

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles can be redeemed at 32.5k, 77.5k, and 87.5k miles for econ, business, and first class/suites respectfully when flying from West Coast US. [Go here to look at their full award chart.](http://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQMI_OneWayAwardCharts.pdf) Now take into account the 15% miles discount if you book online and Singapore Airlines' legendary service quality. You are getting great value for these options.

Amex MR, Chase UR, Citi TY points, and SPG points can all be transferred to Singapore KrisFlyer miles. So you have a lot of easy churning strategies.

Note that some Singapore Air econ and business tickets are on sale right now (as of 21/07/2015) and may not be worth booking econ with miles. It will always be very worth it to redeem miles for Singapore Business/First Class/Suite award seats.

Also, keep it mind that Singapore Air charges above average fees for award tickets. We talking slightly over $100 for SFO/LAX - HND/NRT business; still worth though.

United will charge less for the econ seat, both in points and fees. Unfortunately, United charges more points for business and first class/suite. Also, United has less availible award seats than their partners on a per partner flight bases. If you don't see an business/first class award seat on United, it may still be open on Singapore.



**9.) What other great business and first class award seats are available?**

The Points Guy talks highly about the JAL First class experience. Plus, its only 62.5k AA miles for one-way award seat. Avalibility is extremely low so book well in advanced. Do a little research on the service and you'll fall in love.



**10.) What are you going to do in Japan?**

"2017-11-08 00:45:58"|"Detailed analysis of why a particular flight prices higher on the Chase UR Portal than elsewhere and why Chase may randomly book into the wrong fare type (Economy <-> Basic Economy)"|"Hello everyone, I wanted to post this here since I've seen a few articles on odd prices or booking situations with Chase's UR portal but I never understood what was happening until today.  This is not an exhaustive analysis since it only looks at one route, however I have verified that it seems to apply to all economy fare classes on this route on Lufthansa and is very misleading when trying to book a flight.

**The key takeaway is don't always assume CSR UR Portal is truly 1.5cpp or booked into the fare class you expect (at least for Lufthansa, edit: Alitalia too).  In this post I expand slightly upon an analysis done by FrequentMiler last year on the subject in which he found the same conclusion.**

**Background:** Last year FrequentMiler posted an [article](http://frequentmiler.boardingarea.com/2016/10/05/sapphire-reserve-points-really-worth-1-5-cents-towards-flights/) disputing the value of the Chase UR portal.  He was correct in determining you do not always get 1.5cpp based on how Chase prices flights.  However, he chalked up the reasoning to Chase booking into a higher fare classes.  After staring at booking my own Lufthansa flights for the past 2 days I think I finally see what is going on.

**Background on my situation:** I'm trying to book a flight on 11/19/2017 to get from FRA to FCO in economy.  I found a Lufthansa flight that perfectly fits my needs and we went and booked that flight.  The flight # is LH240 for those who care.  I first investigated other options but ultimately looked at the UR portal to book this.

**The booking:** First step was to look at Google Flights.  I found my flight and went to confirm the price on  the Chase UR portal.  It did not match.  The Google Flights price was cheaper than the price I was seeing by about $20.

This was concerning so just to be sure, I hopped over to Lufthansa.com and priced the exact same flight.  Lufthansa has three tiers of Economy (at least for intra-Europe flights): Light, Classic, and Flex.  After comparing the options, I determined that the Chase must be looking at the Economy Classic fare for this flight.  This meshed with FrequentMiler's analysis and I chalked the $1-2 difference up to the exchange rate.

I then proceeded with my booking.  At first the booking appeared when I checked it on Lufthansa.com but it had not ticketed yet - this isn't an issue.  A few hours later I checked again and everything looked good except I was shown as being in Economy Light rather than Economy Classic.  This was confirmed by the price to pick seats and the bag fees I shouldn't have (you get 1 free checked bag on an Europe Economy Classic fare).

**Contacting Chase:** At first I thought this was a glitch and tried cancelling and rebooking.  This did not work - the flight still ticketed into basic economy.  Not knowing why I was getting economy light for economy classic price, I decided to reach out to Chase.  I tried contacting them, but it took 3 calls before I had a rep willing to do a manual booking for me to delve deeper.  She kept bumping the fare higher and higher to figure out what was going on but couldn't simply rebook me.  She did confirm that I had bought a basic economy fare though - I thanked her for her help and started doing my own research.

**Fare Classes:** At least for these intra-Europe fares, Lufthansa does not have a specific fare class for each tier of service.  What I mean is that for my flight they did not offer E for Basic Economy and Y for normal economy like Delta would, but rather they were selling all economy fares at the same fare class, S.  Looking deeper on ExpertFlyer, I could see that S just meant ""Economy"" so Chase cannot see the difference as easily as they can with Delta.  What this means is you may accidentally buy Economy Light without realizing it.

**Fare Basis Codes:** This is where I started to get an idea of what was going on.  When I looked at this route on ExpertFlyer and ITA Matrix, I could see that Lufthansa was able to make the determination of what tier of economy you were in based on a little code on your ticket called a fare basis.  This basis tells what class of service your in and what price you pay.  For Lufthansa, they use the codes S37LGT9A, S37CLS9A and S37FLX9A to denote Economy Light, Economy Classic, and Economy Flex, respectively.

Looking on ExpertFlyer you can see the base fare that each of these codes should cost.  Using ITA Matrix, you can find flight strictly using the fare basis code and the flight number if you want.  When I did this, I found that my ticket corresponded to the S37LGT9A code rather than the S37CLS9A code I expected.  

This meant that I was booked in Economy Light even though I thought I was getting Economy Classic.  The missing piece of the puzzle to explain the discrepancy came from looking at a breakdown of the taxes and fees.

**OTA Surcharge:** Airlines have 2 surcharges that they can arbitrarily tack on to a flight.  The biggest one we see is YQ - commonly referred to as fuel surcharges.  One other option is YR - from what I've seen they are essentially the same thing insofar as they raise the price of a ticket and are carrier controlled.  In the case of this Lufthansa flight though, the YR surcharge was interesting: it only appeared on OTA bookings.  When pricing the flight out on Lufthansa's website, they quote the taxes and fees at 64.64 EUR, this represents a few different charges including the standard YQ surcharge.  When pricing the bookings out on OTA's websites, Lufthansa is quoting the taxes and fees at 80.64 EUR.  The same surcharges as before are present except one addition, a YR surcharge of 16 EUR.  From what I saw it didn't matter which OTA you used, Lufthansa jacks the price up by 16 EUR no matter what.

**Back to my booking:** Looking back at my flight, I can see now that it is almost exactly 16 EUR pricier than the basic economy option on Lufthansa's website.  The difference is just the exchange rate but works out to just a few cents difference.  It seems not only am I booked into Economy Light, but I'm also being charged like I'm in normal economy.

The following table is an example of the fare codes I could have booked yesterday and what they should have cost + cpp based on my flight needs.

**EDIT: Same goes for Alitalia it seems - added to table**

**EDIT 2: Alitalia seems to price out correctly on Chase, but can't sift thru the fares as easily on OTAs**

Airline | Fare Basis Code (from ExpertFlyer) | Booking Class | Fare Name | Base Fare (from ExpertFlyer) | Surcharges | OTA Surcharges (YR) | Total Price (Direct) | Total Price (OTAs) | CPP (Chase UR vs LH.com price)
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
LH240 | S37**LGT**9A | S | Economy **Light** | 135 EUR | 64.64 EUR | 16 EUR | 199.64 EUR | **215.64 EUR** | **1.39**
LH240 | S37**CLS**9A | S | Economy **Classic** | 155 EUR | 64.64 EUR | 16 EUR | **219.64 EUR** | 235.64 EUR | **1.39**
LH240 | S37**FLX**9A | S | Economy **Flex** | 195 EUR | 64.64 EUR | 16 EUR | 259.64 EUR | 275.64 EUR | **1.41**
AZ407 | XO**LG**3E1 | X | Economy **Light** | 61 EUR | 83.64 EUR | 0 EUR | 144.64 EUR | 144.64 EUR | Did not check
AZ407 | XO**CL**3E1 | X | Economy **Classic** | 81 EUR | 83.64 EUR | 0 EUR | 164.64 EUR | 164.64 EUR | **1.5**
AZ407 | NO**FL**3E1 | N | Economy **Flex** | 252 EUR | 83.64 EUR | 0 EUR | 335.64 EUR | 335.64 EUR | Did not check

**As you can see here, the ticket I bought was remarkably similar to the normal economy fare showing on Lufthansa's site, but because they don't use a distinct fare class, Chase can't figure out what they are.  They don't warn you if you're about to book one of these fares either.  The only way to see is if you read the fare rules for the ticket which isn't always easy to decipher.  Now this may be different for different flights, but for this one in particular it's clear that Chase is not marking things up and glitching out - Lufthansa is.  Overall this is a needlessly complicated system and makes Chase points much harder to use since it's either a crap shoot or requires calling in to book.**

**TL;DR:** Found out today that Chase either can't or won't distinguish between Lufthansa's Economy and Economy Light fares at time of booking.  This is in contrast to Delta's Basic Economy (E) fares which get a bright red/orange warning each time you consider booking them.  This is because Lufthansa uses the same fare classes for Economy, Economy Light, and Economy Flex - the base fare determines the tier of service.

Also found out that Lufthansa marks up their prices on all OTAs intentionally or otherwise by 16 EUR for these flights.  This random extra charge makes the basic economy fare look similar to the normal economy fare right from the get go which makes it seem like you're getting something you're not.  This is why some flights appear higher priced on Chase on others."

&#x200B;

I booked a flight for September 2019 using Korean Air Skypass miles on Delta metal for roundtrip LAX to AMS with some intra-europe flights mixed in. Well it seems that Delta has cancelled the LAX/AMS route entirely. So now my inbound and outbound flights are cancelled, but my intra-europe flights are still there. I have made a bunch of reservations around these dates and I am going to wedding so the dates need to stick and I have about $6000 in reservations. I also booked this 6 months ago.

Been on the phone for hours with Delta and Korean Air (they keep telling me to call the other one). No saver award availability at all. And it seems like Delta won't put me on any of their flights.

I am honestly just expecting Korean Air to just cancel the award booking. And I will probably skip the wedding and the trip entirely.

Anyone have any advice or a course of action?

&#x200B;

EDIT - Wanted to give an update with the end result. I got Delta to put me on DL118 (Delta Suites) to Paris and then on to Rome on Alitalia. Will just take a short train ride to Florence. On the way back they were able to get me Delta One (A330) through JFK and then the 767 on to LAX.  Pretty great result! Thanks for the help everyone. It was helpful to call Korean air and guide them to contacting Delta to open some space."
"2018-08-14 23:28:49"|"Best Chase UR transfer partner(s) for a frugal domestic US traveler with no set travel plans?"|"I know that everyone values award travel differently, but I would appreciate your ideas about what to do. I usually travel within the US and I'm more the kind of person that would book the United super saver 7,500/one-way than 200,000 roundtrip (which, now that I think about it, is kind of weird, since I barely travel anymore).

I have saved up a couple hundred thousand UR points over the past several years and will lose my ability to transfer them out this week for almost one year (read: I will be cancelling my cards and will remain 5/24 with an income that is 1/2-1/3 my current cumulative CL until next Summer). My home airport for the next year is RDU, which is serviced by most airlines (https://www.rdu.com/airline-information/rdu-airlines/), and I have already transferred some URs to WN and UA. 

Is it worth transferring more URs to other airlines in case I fly? I was thinking that Virgin Atlantic might be worthwhile, given the possibility of booking award flights on Delta, since Delta flights tend to be more expensive. Of course, there are many other transfer options and I could also sit on the points for the next year, though I worry about sitting on all of them for that long, not knowing when subsequent devaluation/new restrictions (e.g. not allowing transfer of URs between cards) might occur.

So I called Korean Air, SkyAlliance, and Delta. The Delta people told me that the flight was not canceled, and that it was still on for the same times I originally booked for. The Korean Air people told me they were going to have someone call me back in 24 hours... When the people finally called me back the guy had no clue what I was talking about, and was totally useless. 


I called back Korean Air and explained my problem once again. The difficult part is that I had to book the flights under 2 different reservations since we do not qualify for the ""Family Booking"" for Korean Air just yet. (We arent family yet!). This Korean Air operator was much more helpful and told me that they should be able to put me back on the same flight at the same time, and that once again they would call me back within 24 hours.



When I search for the same flight it shows on the Delta website, and all first class seats are available to book. The flight does not show up under the Korean Air search though. In fact, none of the flights to Calgary show under that day anymore, this slightly worries me. 



Does anyone have any advice/ been in this situation before? Should I be able to get any coupons or vouchers for the issues I have experienced? What should I be asking for when I talk to the representatives/ who is the most productive person to call? Thank y'all for your time. I'm really just worried because I transferred 90K UR points to Korean Air to pay for this flight. I do not want them to ""refund"" my Korean Air points, and then I'm stuck with Korean Sky Pesos instead of UR.


**********UPDATE*********


The reservation has vanished from the ""My reservations"" tab on the Korean Air website. The flight is still listed under my tickets though


**********UPDATE 2*********



Korean Air has changed my flight without consulting me to a different flight that has an overnight layover in Salt Lake City, and it on different days. This does not work for me because of pre-booked honeymoon hotels that are completely full. I will keep trying



********Update 3*********



Just got off the phone with SkyTeam Employee. We talked about transferring my flight to one that is on the same day, and also getting my Fiance on my flight. He said he would contact Delta and get back to me in 24 hours. Also asked about Alaskan Air, so we can see if he can do anything. I will keep this thread updated"

I see regular questions about this destination on this subreddit, and know this is one of the toughest routes to redeem points on, but figured I would toss it out there. 

I'm trying to get my wife and I to New Zealand for a second honeymoon (she had almost no vacation days so we had a really short honeymoon earlier this year). I'm based in PHX, but I have a SW companion pass so really any of the major airports on the west coast could be fair game for routing.

Ideally we'd like to fly direct, but I know there are some routing options through ICN and HNL, particularly going through Australia. I've never redeemed for a premium cabin before, and am mostly a Southwest flier, so this is a bit confusing for me...

Here's what I have to work with. It seems like a lot but I'd still like to use it wisely. Still, I'm sure these will be devalued soon so I need to start burning them.

* Delta: 160K
* American: 172K
* AMEX MR: 333K
* Chase UR: 331K
* SPG: 525K
* Southwest: 493K

I assume availability is either nonexistent or extremely tight most of the year, so is business class to New Zealand still a feasible option for next year? We're not picky at all about when we go, since we'd be totally fine traveling there outside the normal tourist season.

I'd lean towards business class if there is availability, but if there was ever a trip I'd splurge for first this would be it, so I'm open to anything!

Thanks!"

* Anything else I am missing with this booking? **Already signed up for Skypass Family Account**
* It seems as if KrisFlyer has far more availability but does not allow a stopover while Korean does, is this correct?


Thanks in advance!"
"2019-09-28 05:35:20"|"Delta Award Sale"|"Delta is having some really good award sales right now. I just booked 6 tickets from LAX to Heathrow at 28k/ticket for this summer. Not the most ideal with a  red-eye to JFK and then JFK to Heathrow landing at night (3 hour layover, 1.5 was available but never know with JFK). But getting the entire family at 28k each in the main cabin is a good deal with one connection each way. Comfort plus was 80k each.  Delta One was out of reach.  Could have purchased at close to 600 each."

"2019-08-06 08:03:52"|"Award ticket cancelled (IRROPS etc)!! What to do! FAQ"|"""Help!!! My ticket is canceled!""

""United changed their schedule and made the connection impossible!!!""

""United cancelled IAH-SYD for my date....."" etc. 

So you booked an award ticket in first class, and of course something goes wrong. What can you do? 

This is the guide to what you can do in this situation. Feel free to inform me if any part of the guide is wrong, and leave comments about your rebooking experiences.

====================================

The situations are mostly categorized as:

- Whether the ticket is sold by a US carrier (United, AA, Delta), or Asian carrier (ANA, EVA, etc); I never bought an award ticket through European carriers, so can't comment on that

- Whether the airline that sold you the ticket flies the route, eg. both ANA and United flies SFO-NRT

For simplicity, I would call the airline that sold you the ticket ""ticketing carrier"" TC, and the metal ""operating carrier"" OC

Basic knowledge:

Q: Flight cancelled! Who do I call?

A: TC. They sold you the ticket. OC will most likely not willing to modify the ticket, and can only takeover the ticket T-24h to departure.

==================================
Scenarios

a. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through US carriers

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

b. Bought ticket where TC = OC for all segments through Asian carriers

- They will do the same and rebook you to your desired route on their own metal. This is true for the recent EVA strike.

c. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC flies the route

- Congratulations, you've won. You can ask them to open up savor space in the most desired route you want.

d. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC flies the route

- Varies.

- ANA: They WILL NOT open up their own space. Eg. SFO-TPE Eva air ticket through ANA. ANA can fly SFO-NRT-TPE, but THEY WILL NOT rebook you on their own metal. If no award ticket exists, they will CANCEL your ticket, and issue a refund. You can try to do a three way call (you, TC, OC), but most likely won't get you too far.

- Singapore airlines: They will rebook onto their own metal. 

- Need data points for other Asian carriers. 

e. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through US carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- You are probably out of luck. TC can't open up it's own space since they don't fly there, and they can't force OC to open up award space. You can try a three way call but you won't get too far. If TC flies to a nearby airport or award space exists for a nearby airport (eg. United flies to EWR, and original ticket was JFK), they should be willing to change your destination.

f. Bought ticket where TC != OC for all segments through Asian carriers, and TC doesn't fly the route

- Worst case scenario. You can do a three way call, but most likely the ticket will just be cancelled. 


This is what I have experienced, and read stories on. Please feel free to correct me and share your experiences.

Lastly, when a ticket is cancelled, please be rational. If you book an intra-China ticket on Air China through United and the ticket is cancelled, don't expect United to force Air China to open a ticket; the ticket will most likely be cancelled."

"2019-10-13 06:37:41"|"Trying to plan SAN to Germany on mostly points"|"It has been my dream to take my family abroad, but traveling with a family of four is ridiculously expensive. My oldest is already 18... so I'm running out of time... LoL, poor people problems...

Anyway, after trying my best to maximize credit card usage over the last 5 years this is what I have to work with:

AMEX 379k
Chase 47k
Alaska 83k
Southwest 62k
American Airline gift certs: $900

My family would LOVE to go to Germany. We can only travel From June 10th through August. We're in San Diego. What are my best options for flights? I care less about traveling in comfort/style and more about using the least amount of points possible. It would be great to still have points left over to plan a trip somewhere else. We do have an AMEX Platinum so if any stops were at Centurion lounge locations that would be rad.

Anyway, any advice is greatly appreciated. We're open to landing in or visiting surrounding countries. 

Any random advice for other family friendly trips also welcome.

Edit 10/14/2019: So sad. I saw a flight deal yesterday on Delta SAN to MUC round trip for 40k + $140 per person. Actually, I was even able to get the returning flight out of FRA so we wouldn't have to drive back to MUC. Total cost for all 4 tickets 160k +$560. After discussing with the family, I logged in to book it this morning. It's now twice as expensive. ????????????? So, lesson learned. Just book the @#$%! flight and discuss later."

However, with my fianc?e being a kindergarten teacher, we have to fly during peak times so the good transfer options for first class redemption aren't really available.

We are flying to Nairobi from Denver, and plan on doing a positioning flight to stay with my sister in NYC so we can fly direct JFK-NBO from December 21 to Jan 5. The cash price is $2070 on Kenya Airways for main cabin, then we are going to buy some bulkhead seats or something. That comes out to be 138k UR x2 so 276k for both of us.

I really can't find any other better options, is there something I'm missing? I have 445k UR points, 395k Marriott, and 114k Delta points. Marriott Titanium and Delta Gold. We are open to signing up for a few new cards in the meantime."

"2017-09-21 23:01:04"|"[award advice] - Italy fall of 2018"|"Background: 
Wife and I are planning a trip to Italy for October of 2018.  We have to plan ahead, and are willing to spend more miles to do so, because we are leaving two small kids behind and have to arrange for child care while we are going which makes the dates not very flexible. This is my first planned big redemption and its a big trip for us.  With the two kids, we don't do a lot of travel besides some family trips.  So, you will see that a lot of points are looking to be spent, but this is an anniversary trip and I don't see us travelling internationally again for more than 5 years after this.  The goal is to do 1st class and 5 star throughout.  We have been accumulating points for over 2 years. 

I also plan to checkoff a bucket list item, SQ suites.  While, I know it would be a better redemption doing an AP flight.. See above ^^. 

I understand that some people like Air BNB for Italy, we want to do hotels and want to do luxury 5 star on this trip. 

Card Status:

* I am at 3/24 (will be at 5/24 with two upcoming SW card applications).
* Wife is at 4/24

Travel Status:

* Delta - Silver
* SPG - Gold
* Marriott - Gold
* Hilton - Gold 

Home Airport: RDU
Trip Length: 9 total, 7 in Italy, 2 travel
Cities: Rome, Florence, Venice. 

Points Balances:

* 525K UR
* 88K MR
* 116K DL
* 53K Hilton
* 40k Hyatt
* 55k Starwood

The Delta, Hilton, Hyatt and Starwood balances are from flying and hotels, not credit cards.

Plan:

* Depart RDU on 9/25 -> ATL -> FCO on DL 64 flying in Delta One.  I am routinely seeing that route for 70k miles per person for a Tuesday departure 1 year out.  I plan to book that ticket on 10/29 using the 117K DL miles and transferring the remaining from 23k from MRs. 

* Rome: 2 days.  Waldorf Astoria Hotel.   (but I am questioning that decision, see below).  160k.  Will sign up for Hilton Amex before 10/4 for 100k. I should earn the remaining 7k on actual travel before I have to book.  But will fill in with MR where necessary.  This hotel decision is up for debate. 

* Florence: 2 days.  Grand Amore Hotel.  Booked through the Chase portal.  66k UR.  

* Venice: 2 days JW Marriot.  90k Points.  Wife to apply for Marriot 80k visa.  10K UR to cover difference.  This hotel decision is up for debate. 

* VCE -> FRA on Lufthansa in main cabin.  Will buy this ticket cash $443 using my chase travel credit to offset $300 of it.  Will book on Jan 1st.  This will be an evening flight landing around 8:00pm in FRA. 

* Frankfurt: Sheraton attached to airport.  7k points.  Transfer 2k MRs to cover. 

* FRA - JFK: SQ suites.  260k MR.  Will book this as soon as it opens up.  It appears they open flights up randomly... So, I guess I will just be checking every few hours and not sleeping. 

* JFK -> RDU:  Will purchase a flight after Jan 1st and use my other $300 Chase travel credit to cover. 


Questions:

  * DL opens up tickets for sale 331 days in advance. What time of day do they do that? 
  * When should I book hotels? 
  * I am questioning doing the Waldorf in Rome. Its outside the city, there seem to be no benefits to being Hilton Gold there (no free breakfast, no lounge access).  Anyone have pros/cons on Waldorf in Rome to share? 
  * Just like the Waldorf, the Marriott hotel has drawbacks.  It is on its own private island which is nice.  But gold status does not get you free breakfast or lounge access. The rooms just seem 'Ok'.  I would be open to other hotels options in Venice.  If I can find a better non-Hilton hotel in Rome, I could consider the Hilton Molino Stucky.  The Gritti Palace seems like the best option, but the SPG signups are not great right now.
  * Any way to get from Venice to Frankfurt without paying cash?
  * The general booking plan is to secure the SQ flight first, then the DL flight next.  Position for suggested hotels considering current bonus and then connecting flights as soon as I can use Chase travel credits to cover.  Is that the optimal way to approach this?

Note:  This is the optimal itinerary, if something happens with DL, I can flip it around and land in VCE first and fly out of FCO.


Edit:  Based on some feedback and further research, my current plan is to not do Waldorf or the JW Marriott.  Instead I plan to book JK Place Roma using URs and The Gritti Palace using SPG points.  I will wait for some decent signups for SPG.  I will then shift from the Sheraton in Frankfurt to Hilton Garden Inn in Frankfurt.

1) Delta, arriving at 9am

2) AA, arriving at 9am (only reason I would do this is that I have gold status, but would be booking basic econ so minimal effect)

3) Southwest, arriving at 6:45 am

&#x200B;

My specific home airport is CLT but for this discussion let?s focus on any of the major east coast airports, with NYC probably having the most availability from what I can see.

I?m seeing a couple of routes right now that look interesting.

1) Emirates NYC->MLE by way of Dubai

This would be definitely my first choice however the surcharges on awards tickets booked via Korean or Singapore are huge.  

However... there don?t seem to be huge surcharges on a one way on this route coming *back* from MLE.  However this does mean I can?t book via Korean since you can only book round trip awards flights that way on partners.

Am I missing anything here?

2). Air France CDG -> MLE direct

Getting to Paris from the east coast isn?t particularly hard so not going to worry about that part.

This one is bookable via Delta and Air France/Flying Blue.  Even saw some Delta one ways at reasonable mileage.


What other routes/Airlines/booking methods should be considered for this?

What should be avoided?

Can I get them into the lounge as my guest? I've seen some very ambiguous and also specific requirements on various websites.

Will my co-worker and I have to argue with them and pretend to be in a domestic partnership in order to get in? 

In any of these cases we will be taking the same flights, so boarding passes will show the same info.

With this redemption in mind, I went ahead and transferred Amex MR to Virgin Atlantic before the 30% bonus promo ended last week.  So, I now have 240K Virgin Atlantic miles.

It appears that my two best options are ANA first (F) class from LAX, SFO, or IAH (DFW is my home airport but I can relocate easily) or Delta One Suites (A350) from LAX.

Two questions:
1. Is it worth flying out of LAX or SFO (rather than IAH) in order to be able to fly into Haneda instead of Narita?
2. It appears that either redemption will cost me virtually the same number of Virgin Atlantic miles.  However, the ANA fuel surcharges are significantly higher.  Is ANA worth the additional several hundred dollars per person fuel surcharges?

Thanks!

I do not fly a ton (silver medallion status on Delta) and I have never booked a reward flight with Delta.

I'd like to take my family (3 of us total) on business or first class seats to somewhere in Asia with a beach (Thailand, Bali, etc.).

I cannot find any award tickets to Asia from any American city for less than 560,000 miles.

My questions:

"2016-03-10 16:00:58"|"Overview of Getting to Europe Using Amex MRs"|"I tried to do this overview including TYPs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I'm going to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a *LOT* of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Amex MRs***

American Express offers many cards that earn Membership Rewards points, including their Premier Rewards Gold card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for groceries and gas) and their EveryDay card (which earns 20% more MRs every month you make 20 or more purchases with the card). American Express offers several other card options that earn MRs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Amex?s site and check out the options.

Your MRs will transfer to 16 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Delta	| SkyTeam	| 1:1	| Same day
Alitalia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Same day
Aeromexico | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 14 days
British Airways | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | Same day
Iberia	 | OneWorld | 1:0.8 | 4-7 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | 3-7 days
Air Canada | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-14 days
ANA | Star Alliance | 1:1 | 2-4 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 3 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Same day
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | 1-2 days
Jet Blue | N/A | 1:0.8 | Same day
Hawaiian Airlines | N/A | 1:1 | Same day
El Al | N/A | 50:1 | Same day
Emirates | N/A | 1:1 | Same day

The transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your MRs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since British Airways operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be higher than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG or ORY).

**Delta**

Unfortunately, approximately a year ago Delta decided to take down its award chart. Without a published award chart, that means that it is difficult to give a number of miles that it will take to get to Europe. As a general ballpark, from a Delta hub airport, you can expect to see roundtrip award tickets cost approximately 60k in Coach, 125k in Delta Comfort+ and, oddly, 125k in First/Business.

It is worth noting that Delta seems to charge the same amount for Delta Comfort+ seats as they do for First/Business class tickets, so if you are searching for Comfort+ award seats, make sure you are checking out the cost of a First/Business class award ticket as well as the product will be much better. It is also important to remember that Delta will only allow you to book Business class tickets with partner carries, so if you were using Delta SkyMiles for an award ticket on an Air France flight, you would only be able to redeem your SkyMiles for Business class despite the fact that many Air France flights from the U.S. offer a First class cabin.

**Alitalia**

Alitalia is a SkyTeam alliance member that is based out of Rome (FCO). That means that their route network is especially well suited for European redemptions (especially if you are flying into Italy). In addition, you can redeem your MilleMiglia miles for travel on Delta, Air France and KLM flights. Alitalia will levy fuel surcharges on partner award tickets, though they are not going to be as bad as the likes of British Airways. The trick to booking Alitalia awards is to have some miles in your account so they consider it active. From there you can call and place your award ticket on hold for about two (2) weeks. You can then transfer the needed miles and then call back to get the ticket booked.

To/from Italy on Alitalia flights, award tickets will cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach, 65k miles roundtrip in premium economy and 80k miles roundtrip in business. Flights on partner airlines should cost you 50k miles roundtrip in coach and 80k miles roundtrip in business, though there is no current published partner award chart. Alitalia does allow one-way award tickets on Alitalia flights at a little more than one-half the cost (for example, a one-way business class award is 48k miles), though they do not allow one-way award tickets on partner airlines, so you have to book roundtrip tickets when utilizing partners. Lastly, while you must book the most direct itinerary, you are allowed one voluntary stopover.

The US phone number for Alitalia is 800.223.5730.

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. I personally find FlyingBlue slightly easier to use for award tickets than Alitalia, so if you are looking for a coach redemption and are not concerned with the free stopover, I would recommend going with FlyingBlue over Alitalia. If you are looking for a business class redemption though, Alitalia is hands down the way to go. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Aeromexico**

Aeromexico is another SkyTeam alliance member, which means you can again redeem Club Premier miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. Aeromexico is a unique program in several regards. First and foremost, your MRs will transfer to Club Premier at a 1:1 ratio for miles. This is important because Club Premier uses kilometers instead of miles. Your Club Premier miles will be transferred to kilometers at a 1:1.6 ratio, which means for every 1,000 MRs you transfer, you would actually receive 1,600 Club Premier kilometers. I will do the conversion math for you so you can easily reference how many MRs it will cost you if you transferred to Aeromexico.

Second, Aeromexico uses a two-tiered award chart which has a high season price and a low season price. The ?high season? is considered June 1st through August 18th, December 8th through January 16th, and the Monday before Holy Week through the Sunday following Holy Week. Holy Week in Mexico is from Palm Sunday (March 20, 2016) to Holy Saturday (March 26, 2016), which means for 2016 ?high season? will be March 14, 2016, through April 2, 2016. The ?low season? is considered all other times during the year.

Aeromexico charges 88k kilometers (55k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the ?low season? and 100k kilometers (62.5k MRs) roundtrip in coach and 160k kilometers (100k MRs) roundtrip in business during the ?high season?. One-way award tickets are allowed and cost 44k kilometers (27.5k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the ?low season? and 50k kilometers (31.25k MRs) in coach/80k kilometers (50k MRs) in business during the ?high season?.

As you can see, there are much better deals to be had out there for award tickets to Europe than Aeromexico. The only way I would consider this redemption would be if you have a large stash of Club Premier kilometers you need to burn off. Otherwise, look elsewhere for transfer options.

**British Airways/Iberia**

British Airways and Iberia somewhat share an award program where both have a distance based award chart, so your home airport is really going to make the biggest difference here in how much an award ticket to Europe will cost you. Unfortunately, last year American Express and British Airways/Iberia devalued their transfer rate slightly to 1:0.8. As both British Airways and Iberia are members of the OneWorld alliance, you can use your Avios to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Belin, Finnair or American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US (Boston), you can expect a cost of ~17-24.5k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, ~30-44k Avios for premium economy, ~57.75-69k Avios for business and ~75.75-87.75k Avios for first for a one-way redemption. Keep in mind that Boston is your best bet for a departure airport for keeping your award ticket costs low. Other East Coast airports like Philadelphia (PHL), New York (JFK), Charlotte (CLT), Washington (IAD/DCA) and Chicago (ORD) are all going to put you into the next award ticket distance bracket which obviously increases your award ticket cost.

From the West Coast of the US it will be a bit more expensive as you can expect a cost of ~21-20k Avios (depending on peak or non-peak travel dates) for coach, 36.5k-56.5k Avios for premium economy, ~83-99k Avios for business and ~108-128k Avios for first for a one-way redemption.

Again, keep in mind that these are price ranges for flights to Paris, so your award ticket cost may vary from these numbers depending on your home airport, number of connections needed and destination. Also keep in mind that British Airways levies hefty fuel surcharges for flights on their aircraft, so if you can avoid flying their aircraft to London/Manchester, you are much better off.

Lastly, it is important to remember that the transfer ratio is 1:0.8, so your flight that costs 20k Avios will actually cost you 25k MRs. In light of the costs (both Avios and fuel surcharges), unless you are based out of an East Coast airport where you can find a direct partner flight to your European destination or have a glut of Avios you want to burn, you are better off transferring your MRs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe ? especially if you are looking to travel in a premium cabin.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific?s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your MRs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Air Canada (Aeroplan)**

Air Canada is a Star Alliance member, so you can use your Aeroplan miles for redemptions on Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

Aeroplan breaks Europe into 2 regions ? Europe 1 and Europe 2. Europe 1 consists of the following countries:

* Austria
* Belguim
* Denmark
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Italy
* Luxembourg
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Portugal
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 1 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 60k miles in coach, 75k miles in premium economy, 110k miles in business and 140k miles in first.

Europe 2 consists of the following countries:

* Albania
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Belarus
* Bosnia
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* Georgia
* Greece
* Greenland
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Lativia
* Lithuania
* Macedonia
* Malta
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Poland
* Romania
* Russia (western)
* Serbia
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

A roundtrip award ticket to Europe 2 using Aeroplan miles will cost you 75k miles in coach, 90k miles in premium economy, 115k miles in business and 160k miles in first.

Air Canada does allow one-way award tickets at half the cost of the roundtrip award ticket cost. While I do love Aeroplan miles, the redemptions to Europe 1 are decent, but the redemptions to Europe 2 are not great. If you are going to a Europe 1 destination, I would give Aeroplan some consideration. If you are going to a Europe 2 destination, I would look at other transfer partners for your MRs.

**ANA**

ANA is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Mileage Club miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you ~55k miles in coach, ~88k miles in business and ~165k miles in first.

ANA does not allow for one-way award tickets (there is a way around this, though I do not think it is necessarily worthwhile unless you have Mileage Club points to burn). ANA can present a good option for coach redemptions in the event you are not able to find space through one of the less expensive transfer partners. While I would not burn the miles on a first class redemption to Europe, ANA offers exceptional value for business class tickets to Europe. I would give ANA some serious consideration, especially if you can grab a flight on a premium carrier like Swiss!

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. Again, in other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore?s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

As u/lonely_laowai pointed out (thanks!), Virgin America also partners with Singapore Airlines, so you could use your Elevate points for Singapore's New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) 5th freedom route. Roundtrip you would be looking at 20k points + $147 in taxes and fees for coach, 59k points + $147 in taxes and fees for business class and 90k points + $147 in taxes and fees for first class. That is actually a pretty solid deal for coach and business and a decent deal for first class. I would imagine that award availability on this route is going to be pretty limited though considering how limited availability tends to be on this route with KrisFlyer miles. You would also need to find a separate way to get from Frankfurt to your ultimate destination - though Europe is the king of the low cost carriers, so this probably would not be a big issue.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees and the redemption with Singapore Airlines) are quite good, it is important to remember that your MRs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of MRs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic one of the worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**JetBlue**

JetBlue does not fly to Europe, so transfers to the TrueBlue program do you no good. Cross this airline off your list right from the start for an award redemption to Europe.

**Hawaiian Airlines**

Hawaiian Airlines itself does not fly to Europe, so you would have to redeem with one of their partners. The only Hawaiian Airlines partner that flies to Europe however is Virgin Atlantic. In addition to being limited to your destinations, you will also be subject to the outrageous fuel surcharges, taxes and fees that Virgin Atlantic imposes on their award tickets.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 60k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 100k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 125k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 80k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fess for coach, 130k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 160k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Not only does Hawaiian Airlines offer one of the highest award ticket mileage costs for European redemptions, but they also pass on Virgin Atlantic?s astronomical taxes and fees. This makes Hawaiian Airlines the single worst MR transfer partner for award tickets to Europe. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**El Al**

From what I can tell, El Al does publish an award chart for redemptions to 20 European destinations, but it is unclear if the award chart is for flights from El Al?s hub at Tel Aviv (TLV) or elsewhere. I believe these are the award ticket costs for flights from Tel Aviv, so you would need to find your own way to Tel Aviv, or book one of El Al?s flights from the U.S. From New York (JFK) or Toronto (YYZ) to Tel Aviv (TLV) you are looking at 1,400 points for coach, 3,000 points for business class and 5,000 points for first class. From Los Angeles (LAX) to Tel Aviv you are looking at 1,800 points for coach, 4,000 points for business class and 5,400 points for first class.

El Al also uses a winter and summer season points system which changes according to your travel dates. The Winter Season (?WS?) is January 1 ? March 24 and November 1 ? December 31, while the Summer Season (?SS?) is March 25 ? October 31.  El Al?s 20 European destinations (including award ticket costs) include:

* Athens (160 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,000 for business class)
* Moscow (500 WS/500 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Vienna (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Warsaw (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,200 for business class)
* Bucharest (500 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Sofia (600 WS/700 SS for economy; 1,500 for business class)
* Munich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,800 for business class)
* Geneva (600 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Venice (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Rome (700 WS/800 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Frankfurt (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,400 for business class)
* Barcelona (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Zurich (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,000 for business class)
* Madrid (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 1,600 for business class)
* Milan (800 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Brussels (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Marseilles (700 WS/900 SS for economy; 2,200 for business class)
* Amsterdam (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,400 for business class)
* London (Heathrow & Luton) (900 WS/1,000 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)
* Paris (1,000 WS/1,100 SS for economy; 2,600 for business class)

One-way award tickets will cost you half of the prices quoted above. Since El Al is not a partner in any of the airline alliances, it does not appear that it is possible to redeem El Al Matmid miles for an award ticket to Europe on any other carriers.

It is important to remember that your MRs will transfer at a ratio of 50:1 to the Matmid program, so you are looking at 5,000 MRs for every 100 Matmid points. That makes an economy award flight to Paris in the Winter Season cost 50,000 MRs, which while not horrible, is not also great as it is unclear if you would need to route yourself to Tel Aviv as well. That does not include the cost to get you to Tel Aviv. Accordingly, I would look elsewhere for good redemptions to Europe unless you will already be in Tel Aviv.

**Emirates**

Emirates uses a zone based award chart, so your redemption cost will largely depend on your departure airport and your arrival airport. 

From the North America East zone (BOS, JFK, IAD, MCO & YYZ) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Milan ? from JFK only)
* 45k miles for coach; 90k miles for business class; and 135k miles for first class
* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 85k miles for coach; 170k miles for business class; and 255k miles for first class

From the North America West zone (DFW, IAH, LAX, SFO & SEA) roundtrip saver award tickets will cost you:

* Europe West (Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Nice, Paris, Lyon, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Venice, Bologna, Malta, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lisbon, Dublin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Barcelona, Stockholm, Zurich, Geneva, Birmingham, Glasgow, London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle & Kiev)
* 95k miles for coach; 190k miles for business class; and 285k miles for first class
* Europe South (Athens, Istanbul & Cyprus)
* 90k miles for coach; 180k miles for business class; and 270k miles for first class

If you are opting to use Emirates to get to Europe, you are slightly better off doing so starting from the North America East zone. The only real sweet spot with flying Emirates to Europe is if you are traveling to Milan from New York (JFK) as it is very reasonably priced. With the exception of the JFK-Milan route, all other routes are going to take you through the Middle East. So even though you will be on a far superior airline to the other MR transfer partners, it is going to increase your total travel time. For me, this would not bother me, but it may for others who prefer to take the most direct routing. Regardless, the award ticket costs (sans the JFK-Milan route) just are not competitive with the other MR transfer partners.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your MRs!"
"2018-10-19 18:59:50"|"Advice to get to Philippines using a combo of UR, DR, and SPG pts/miles?"|"The boyfriend and I are planning a trip to the Philippines next year (3/15/19 to 4/15/19) and I have a combination of all sorts of points and miles. Currently I have:

\- 105,181 Chase Ultimate Rewards Points  
\- 53,996 Delta Skymiles  
\- 40,087 SPG Points

I understand that I may not have enough points right now but I travel every week for work so these points are always increasing and because of this I have a few questions:

1. when is the best time for me to book flights? 

* I have heard 3 months in advance to like 2 week in advance but I don't know what is the truth and if that applies to me due to me trying to use my various points as payment. Is it too late to get award flights, have I fucked myself?

2. is there a way for me to combine all these points easily?

* I know that UR will not transfer to Delta directly but there are some roundabout ways I can get them there. I have read those articles and get so overwhelmed and confused by the process. I think I need someone to ELI5 if this even is a possibility anymore. 

3. should I get a Delta CC now in hopes to accrue enough frequent flier miles before the trip?

4. I'm a Gold Medallion member on Delta so if I book a flight with them, what are the chances of getting upgraded to business/first class? Does this happen on international flights? Does this happen if I use points to pay for a flight? Is this a stupid question?

\------------------------------------------

Here's my plan of attack, and any constructive criticism is welcome:

Step 1: we live in TN and while we have an international airport here, it seems cheaper if we fly out from one of the coasts so I need to determine if it's cheaper to fly from LAX or JFK.

Step 2: if cheaper to fly out from the coast, use my Delta Skymiles to get us to one of those places.

Step 3: determine the best and cheapest airline to fly to MAN on and if I can transfer my SPG points to UR.

Step 4: if that airline is a Chase travel partner, transfer points to that airline and purchase tickets or purchase ticket directly through the UR portal.

Step 5 (optional): if possible, use cold, hard cash to pay for upgraded tickets.

Step 6: get to the Philippines and have stupids amount of fun :D

"2018-10-17 19:29:01"|"Delta Mileage Run Help"|"Hi, I am new to the miles game and I want to earn Silver status with Delta for 2019.  I would like to plan a mileage run in early December that would earn 14,000 MQM and 1,300 MQD.  I am based out of CMH.  By using the Delta website and looking at their earnings calculator, the best flight I can find is CMH-PVG in Premium Select and that comes to 22,412 MQM, 1630 MQD, for a price of $1,721.03.  I Also looked at CMH-NRT in Comfort Plus but it was about $100 short on MQD.

&#x200B;

The CMH-PVG flight is way more MQM than I need and several hundred more MQD than I need, and I would prefer not to fly across the Pacific if at all possible (like I would rather fly a shorter distance and pay a bit more if necessary).  I haven't found a route in the USA that would get me the necessary MQM.  Do you guys have better ideas?  Also, I was wondering how booking on Delta's partners work since their MQM earnings are higher, but is this not already factored in when I book on Delta's website?  As in, should I try booking on Aeromexico's website for a flight to Latin America?  Or does it not work like that?  Also, is there a calculator that I can see how much that flight would earn if that is the right way to do it?

Being a award travel nerd I took this as a challenge and decided to go wide open on making this one hell of a trip. The result? I'm pretty proud - what does /r/awardtravel think?

Origin/Destination: Atlanta, GA

Leg 1: Trip to Italy (end destination is Positano, just south of Naples)

* ATL-MIA - Delta Domestic First Class
* MIA-FCO - Alitalia Business A330 in Honeymoon Seat
* FCO-NAP - Alitalia 

Leg 2: Trip from NAP to CDG

* Likely will be EasyJet. Hoping to get Flexifare. 

Leg 3: CDG to Lombok, Indionesia

* CDG - SIN - Singapore Suites
* SIN - LOP - Silkair Business

Leg 4: Bali to ATL

* DPS - ICN - Korean Air A330-200 Business
* ICN - ATL - Korean Air A380 in First

I travel a lot on Delta and found the Alitalia flights myself by piecing together ATL-MIA and MIA-FCO-NAP. Overall cost was around 160k total. 

Singapore flights were waitlisted and later cleared at which point I purchased with a combination of Citi, AMEX, and Chase points. Those were about 180k total. 

Korean was via Chase points. Total cost was 190k Korean Air Points. Availability is wide open. 

I cannot wait! Please let me know if you have any questions!

I'm seeing 45k delta miles for main cabin and 64k miles for Delta Comfort.   

Would korean air allow me to even book delta comfort seats for more skypass miles?

Any idea if korean air would book me economy main cabin seats that cost 30k delta miles for a few thousand more skypass miles?  Or is there a set boundary set at 45k delta miles round trip for 25k skypass miles?

Not sure if its worth it but I do have a 1 year old that I will be traveling with and figured whatever extra leg room I could get would help.

Any of you ever gone to Hawaii using business/first class saver seats?

Thanks everyone!"
"2019-07-05 04:17:52"|"Honeymoon July 2020"|"So I?m starting to build back up some UR points to open up options, but wondering if there are any ideas out there. Right now we are thinking of doing 7-10 days at the Hyatt Zilara in Jamaica. We are both pretty frugal so the idea of an all inclusive is kinda nice so we can have a trip where we don?t have to care about $40 dinners, lol. We would be open to anywhere else on the world though. We would prefer at least 3-4 days on a beach though. 

Traveling from Sioux Falls (FSD): United, Delta, and American. 

UR points: currently have 75k, fianc?e was just approved for CSP for 60k, plan to MS about 12k per month in points. Should have about 200k UR by year end. 

MR points: currently 80k, plan to ms another 80k on the Amex gold. Should have around 160k by year end (Could hit it hard in Jan/feb to get another 100k, but some of those points wouldn?t post until March so that?s cutting it close).

SW: 95k

I will be 3/24 in August after 8 cards hit 2 years. Plan on getting the chase Hyatt for 50k points.

Edit: we like to do some easy/moderate hiking and sightseeing, try new foods. I guess to give you an idea of the types of vacations we have done: last year we did San Francisco, checked out the redwoods, downtown SF, just walking around Chinatown to try the food, fireworks over the bay of 4th of July, then Monterey and down to bixby bridge. Next we did Puerto Rico and Miami. Tried to see the rain forest, but 75% of it was still closed so bummed about that. Checked out old San Juan and  Castillo San Felipe del Morro, try the local food, Bacardi distillery, spent a couple days just relaxing at the beach at Wyndham Margaritaville. Went to a Dolphins game in Miami, drive down to the keys for a day, spent a day at Miami Beach. Then in April, Hawaii. Kuaui (5 days) Maui (3 days). Food trucks, Koke?e, Waimea canyon, boat cruise of the na pali coast, road to Hana, Haleakala, beach time. 

I?m into history, she likes historical buildings. Like I said, we want a beach too. At least 3-4 days without leaving the property (except maybe for food if not inclusive). Probably went from not enough detail to too much detail, lol. Thanks in advance.

Just to add, before Hawaii I played around the idea of saving for a RTW trip. She didn?t like the idea of being gone for 6 weeks, so we blew some points on Hawaii. Some destinations I came up when brainstorming that were Bali (beach), Japan (culture), New Zealand (idk, she likes it), Egypt (history), Italy (history), and Peru (Machu Picchu)."

tl;dr: I finally started burning through my points last Jan 2016. On my second trip in Feb 2016, I was drunk at the hostel bar and challenged myself to do 12 trips in 12 months. It just so happened to be 14 trips because I took a trip in Dec 2015 and Jan 2016.

Detailed Trips or as best as I can remember it.

| Location/Date | Cash/Points | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
Tokyo Dec 2016 | **60k Skypesos** on Delta Y, JFK-MSP-HND | Delta had a flash sale promoting their MSP - HND route. JFK happened to be on that promotion, JFK - MSP - HND. I wanted to go back to Tokyo for sometime now and figured a long weekend in Tokyo would be fun. I stayed at a capsule hostel, partied and ate my weekend away. Hoping to do this again sometime this year.
Singapore, Maldives, Tokyo Jan 2017 | **93.k SQ miles** on SQ Suites JFK-FRA-SIN, One way cash flight to MLE on tigerair, **75k Hyatt** for Park Hyatt Maldives, **15k Avois** MLE-CMB-SIN, **40k UA miles** on ANA F SIN-NRT, **80k AA miles** on JAL F | So this was my biggest goal and redemption. So this was my biggest goal and redemption. For years I?ve read about SQ Suites and my #1 goal in churning was this and I got it. Stayed in a hostel again in Singapore and man was it humid. I figured since I was in Signapore and the Maldives was so close, why not try and go for it. Park Hyatt didn?t have free nights available for my certificates but it was available for 25k per night. Booked 3 nights and paid for a cheap tigerair fight out. In hindsight, the tigerair was late at night, didnt get to PH until 1am. That was a waste. I?ve never been to a resort before and this was beautiful. Oh yea, used my Arrival miles to pay for the transfer fee. For this trip, I wanted to fly out of Tokyo either on JAL or ANA. I flew back to SIN using avois on SriLankan Y. I found a cheap 40k UA miles one way on ANA F. Hell yea I?m taking it and to my surprised it on the BB-8 plane. Spent another weekend in Tokyo, ate and drank away. JAL opened up and I took it home from NRT-JFK for 80k AA miles. I flew around the planet in 11 days.
Rome Feb 2017 | **60k Skypesos** on Altalia Y | I was itching to go away again and went to Rome for a long Prez weekend. Stayed at the Yellow Hostel, which I recommend to everyone. Toured, ate and drank away. I?m not religious by any means but man the Vactican was impressive. I?d love to visit again. During this weekend, I was drunk at the hostel bar and figured to myself why not try and do 12 trips in 12 months for 2017. 
Cancun Mar 2017 | **6k Jetblue** one way JFK-CUN, Cash flight Delta with gc CUN-JFK, **2 night free Hyatt Cert** at Hyatt Zilara | Used my 2 Hyatt free night at Hyatt Zilara Cancun. Beautiful property, great good. My friend and I ate our way through this weekend. Sushi was trash.
Puerto Rico April 2017 | **25k Merrill points** | This weekend happened to have a big storm in NYC. My flight delayed for 2 days. Tested out the trip delay insurance and hey they approved it even tho JFK was my home airport. Spent 2 days in Puerto Rico. Wish I had more time to explore.
Iceland May 2017 | Cash flight | Went to Iceland for a long Memorial day weekend. Stayed a hostel again. Man Iceland is f?king expensive. I could not be the foodie like I wanted to because it was so expensive. Went on a tour that took us to a natural hot spring, that was cool. Didn?t do blue lagoon. Made a hostel friend and tagged along his ride for the day. Love to go back when I have some extra extra money. The daylight at 2am was insane. Definitely messed with my head
Havana June 2017 | **SW CP to Havana** | Made a churning friend and we went to Havana. Humid af, didn?t understand all the hype about it. Would not go back.
Tijuana July 2017 | Walked over to Tijuana | Ok, this one I cheated a bit. I was in town in San Diego for Comic Con and to make sure I was out of the country, I walked over the border to Tijuana, ate some tacos and walked back over.
Thailand August 2017 | **120k UA miles** on Asiana F going, **80k ANA J** back. | So this was booked over Thanksgiving 2016. My friend?s biggest goal was going to Thailand and we were researching ways to get there. He wanted to fly any J class and we found 80k Asiana J one way. Impulsively we booked it roundtrip. Over the course of 2017, I moved over another 40k from UR to UA and upgraded myself to Asiana F. The look on my friend?s face when he realized I was flying F day of, was priceless. Of course I invited him down to my suite and we drank some whisky. We paid cash for our hotel stays in Thailand. Have to say, the Hilton gold came in handy for breakfast. Went to Bangkok, Chang Mai, Phi Phi Islands and Phuket. Love to go back and explore more of the islands. I hope that russian milf is doing well.
Bahamas September 2017 | **25k Skypesos** on Delta Y, **40k Hyatt** at Grand Hyatt Baha Mar | Delta had a flash sale to the Carribean for 25k and I moved over 40k UR and stayed at the new Grand Hyatt Baha Mar. Also used a club room cert to get access to the club lounge. I love free food. Another beautiful property and nice pools. Though wasn?t worth 40k points for the weekend.
Oslo & Bergen October 2017 | Cash flight on Norweign JFK-OSL and SAS BGO-OSL, **25k Merrill** points on TAP Portugal J OSL-LIS-JFK | Went on a trip with new churning friends. One of them found the cheap J fare from OSL-LIS-JFK on TAP Portugal, now we just have to made our way to OSL. We blew $300 each at Maaemo, a 3 michelin star restaurant. That was delicious. Drove our way up to Bergen from OSL, great views along the way. Took a flight back to OSL from BGO and flew back on TAP Portugal J. TAP was ok, nothing really to be excited about.
Singapore & Maldives November 2017 | **120k SQ miles** on SQ Suites, JFK-FRA-SIN. Cash at Marina Bay Sands. **15k Avois** SIN-CMB-MLE. **205.5k SPG** points at St. Regis Maldives. $100 flight MLE-DXB-JFK on Emirates | Sometime during 2017, Emirates had a mistake fare for MLE-JFK. Friend and I took advantage of that. He was jealous I went to the Maldives and the one way I?m going back is if I can get the St. Regis. Good thing for still living at home, I took advantage of my family(with their consent) a built up a stash of SPG points. Booked 3 nights overwater villa at 58.5k a night over Thanksgiving. No more availability for extra nights but cash and points were available for a garden villa for $300/15k points a night. Spent 5 days in the Maldives but shitty weather. Backtracking a bit, since I was transitting through Singapore, I wanted to try a fly SQ suites again. I didn?t get off the waitlist until 5 days before. I was adamant to take advantage of everything on the flight but I ended up sleeping through most of it. Met up with my friend in Singapore and we spent a night at Marina Bay Sands. Pool was beautiful but shitty weather.
Brussels & Paris December 2017/NYE | **60k Skypesos** JFK-BRU RT | This was my last trip for the year and I wanted to do NYE in another city. Figured lets go to Europe. Found a 60k flight RT, JFK-BRU. I didn?t want to spend all my time in BRU and so I went down to Paris for NYE. Stayed at a hostel, made some friends and partied into NYE. Went back to Brussels for a night and flew out.
Jamaica Jan 2018 | **15k Jetblue miles**, JFK-MBJ. Cash flight back. **2 Free night at Hyatt** Zilara Rosehall | This time my friend comes through. He got 2 free hyatt nights as well and wanted to go to another Zilara so we can pig out. I moved over enough points to cover one night so we?d get 3 nights. Got upgraded to a large Butler Suite. Property overall was not impressive. The jerk chicken and french restaurant was nice but thats about it. The pools were cold af. Would not come back here.


Overall, 2017 was my best year living life. Even though I traveled for mostly freeish, my bank account hurts. 

**Notes**

- For those who wonder how I get some many days off work. I mostly travel during weekends so I can take advantage of long weekends, usually Thur-Tues. I also transferred over a decent amount of vacation days in Jan 2017 which helped out alot.

- Still living at home, which helps my bank account and I run through all our bills through my cards.

- Player 2 and half of 3 with family members, which helped me alot

- Still have 500k UR, 170K AA, 130k Skypesos, 100k SPG, 170k MR and others

- Looking to build up my points stash on my extra players in 2018.

- Itching to book another flight/trip. Really want to fly EY apartments."

My Platinum card will get me access to the Sky Clubs, as we are flying Delta, but I'm curious what people think of the lounges and whether they're worth paying the extra amount for guest access.

I also have Priority Pass (with restaurant access), so other options would be as follows:

LAX - Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse; Alaska Lounge. (I believe Terminal 1 isn't accessible airside so Rock & Brews is out, and the KAL Lounge and PF Changs won't be open when we're there.)

PHX - the temporary/future Centurion Lounge

* Hilton: 2k + 22k

We would be flying out of Boston Logan.

**Edit:** thanks for the responses so far, will reply to specific posts but just to clarify, we probably aren?t interested in the Caribbean since we?ve been a few times already (and just got back from a cruise) - we?ve been to St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Martin, Anguilla, Antigua, St. Thomas, St. John, Haiti, Aruba, San Juan, and probably a couple others I?m forgetting."
"2017-10-31 22:26:59"|"Kauai Trip Report 2017"|"Found myself booking a last minute, 5 night, Labor Day weekend trip to Hawaii.

 Stayed 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort. This hotel is absolutely stunning right from the [entrance](http://imgur.com/a/zsqYv) with several pools, a lazy river, a man made beach, as well as access to the resorts own private beach, tennis courts, spa and gym, as well as several other amenities. [Here are some pics of the above mentioned areas](https://imgur.com/a/HvIIj)

[A drone pic I took of the resort](http://imgur.com/a/mwHaA)

Because I took advantage of the Hyatt to MLife back to Hyatt match I was able to get the explorist benefits. They were very nice upgrading us to an ocean room, complementary valet, free breakfast buffet, and so on... 

As for the rental car, since I took part in that glitch several months ago with Hertz Presidents Circle, I got upgraded to an amazing SS Camaro Fifty edition convertible for the price of an economy car and could not be happier! [Car Pics](https://imgur.com/a/7ikg2) and heres a [drone shot of us driving](https://imgur.com/a/rxasu)

As for flights booked through Korean Air with Delta for First class (only flight available since I booked last minute). After reading online about the aircraft Delta would be using I was not so excited as it was just a standard recliner and read that it would be a drop down entertainment system but was shocked to see the first class cabin to look somewhat new, with a built in TV, and of course very comfortable. My wife's seat would not recline, her TV was glitchy, and they forgot our meal so I tweeted Delta and they offered 25k miles each or $200 voucher. Ended up getting 90k back in DL points by complaining via twitter and then sending in a complaint form online through their portal for both my wife and I.

 Here are [pics of the cabin](http://imgur.com/a/okMBC)


We spent the Friday & Saturday at the resort the whole time and Sunday, through the rest of the trip, is when we explored the the wonderful Island and ended up barely spending any time at the resort! We rented snorkeling gear and stopped at several of the beaches as we drove throughout the Island over the course of the next few days:
 
[Poipu Beach](https://imgur.com/a/vZSsG)- Beautiful beach right by the resort that has a wonderful array of fish and is suitable for beginner snorkels 

Waileu Beach- Great place for beginner snorkels as well. Crowded but very fun and a good place to bring kids.

[Lawai Beach](https://imgur.com/a/imblq) - Definitely felt as though this beach was for someone who has at least gone snorkeling a couple of times.  The waves were a bit stronger here but this where we sighted several massive sized turtles.

[Ka?e Beach](https://imgur.com/a/62C1C) - Beautiful beach all the way at one of the ends of the island. Stunning views of the mountain side and ocean. Difficult to get a parking spot.

[Polihale beach](https://imgur.com/a/YdoX0) - was fine to drive with the Camaro... A bit annoying and bumpy but definitely doable. Besides that, it was an amazing sunset view and definitely a place to drive out to.

We of course visited the [queens bath](https://imgur.com/a/CYlFy), [Waimea canyon](https://imgur.com/a/jZacj) (absolutely stunning), [Wailua River Water Falls](https://imgur.com/a/qSX7r), and other attractions throughout the island. 

To save on food we purchased a toaster oven from Costco..., and the typical groceries from the stores in the area and for some days just made and heated up food.

Points breakdown:

Flights: 45k each Roundtrip with Delta First Class LAX-->LIH

Hotel: 25k (Category 6) each night at Grand Hyatt Kauai for a total of 5 nights

Car Rental: $125 for 3 days with a convertible class car
Minus the 90k I received from Delta and the 25k points from Hyatt for tweeting them a picture of a roach in our room.

P.S. First time writing one of these so sorry about any misformating or any other mistakes :) Also, I am in no way a photographer so keep that in mind (especially when you see the stills I attempted to take from the drone videos)!

Our trip is in April of next year, and we're going to Qatar, Jordan, and Israel over 12 days.  Thank you again to you folks here at /r/awardtravel for the great ideas and inspiration.  This is the first award trip I've been able to put together where we actually depart and return to the same airport.  Wonderfully, it's also our home airport: JFK.

**\*\*Points Used:\*\***

* 175,000 AA
* 150,000 IHG
* 170,000 Delta

**\*\*Flights\*\***

Compared to some of my other award booking experiences in the past (Japan, South-East Asia, India, France) booking these flights was a complete breeze.  Getting what I really wanted, however, was a different story.  I had loads of AA miles, and searching for space was simple on their website.  I found two seats on Qatar airways in Qsuites J on their new A350-1000 for 70k miles and minor taxes per person.  Flights leave from JFK and arrive to Doha the next morning.

Here's where I don't get my way.  The wife and I wanted to see Qatar, but didn't want to spend a lot of time there, so I endeavored to find a flight going from Doha to Amman, Jordan that left within 24 hours of our arrival.  American routing rules only allow for a 24-hour stopover on the same award ticket.   There are multiple oneworld carriers leaving from Doha to Amman every morning, but the timing was 26 or 27 hours after we landed, so they wouldn't be allowed by AA.  I did find one flight that left 24 hours and 20 minutes after we landed, and tried tried tried tried to get AA to allow it, but they wouldn't budge.  24 hours is 24 hours.   I ended up spending 17.5k points pp to book us on one of the next morning flights in Y for the 2.5 hour flight.  I considered cash rates, but they were VERY high - \~$900 for just the one-way for two people.  Points made more sense.

For our flights home, we were leaving from Israel - I easily found space on Virgin Atlantic from Tel Aviv to London to JFK in Upper Class for 85,000 miles and $70 per person.  The flight from London to JFK is slotted to be on their new A350-1000 as well, so I'm excited to try that!  I looked into finding non-stops, but there appeared to be only three carriers doing it: United (which I didn't want to spend my UR on this), Delta (which cost 350k points per person), and El Al (which only transfers with MR for the horrible rate of 20:1000).

**\*\*Hotels\*\***

My wife and I ended up booking most of our hotels with cash, as the rates this early before the trip were very reasonable.   Most nice hotels in the three countries we're going to didn't end up being more than $200 a night, the two exceptions being the Four Seasons Doha and Amman.

The points exception, however, was the Intercontinental David Tel Aviv - I actually got these points by cancelling an Intercontinental stay in Osaka that I had booked in a previous post, and had a few work stays in Kimptons and Indigos between then and now.  The award rate was 50k points per night, and cash rates were over $400, so it felt like a great deal!  The total cost was 200k, but IHG has the ""4th night free"" promotion on reward bookings, so it was only 150k points out of pocket.

We're looking forward to trying falconry in Qatar, camping in the desert in Wadi Rum, seeing Jerusalem, swimming in the Dead Sea, walking around Petra, and exploring all the amazing food!  Can't wait to come back with a trip report.

Thank you again, /r/awardtravel \- this will be a great trip and it's possible from all the good advice to be found on this sub."

So here is the trip:

* Cathay Pacific Business
* 49,500 AA points (I booked pre-devaluation, with 10% return thanks to my AA card)
* **Review:** Freaking amazing. I've flown Cathay First Class before, but I really enjoyed the Business a lot more. In first class, I got bothered by all the attention the attendants would give you. Because it's only 6 seats, you go from ""oh wow this is amazing"" to ""yeah, I shouldn't be here"" reaaaal quick. I believe Business Class is the perfect combination of luxury travel, comfort, and privacy. 10/10 would blow points on this route again. 



**Manila to Seoul** 

* Asiana Airlines Economy
* 20,000 UA points
* **Review:** The Korean food was awful. I think I definitely could have done this route more efficiently. 



**Seoul to Singapore**

* Singapore Economy
* 19,125 SQ points (15% back by booking online)
* **Review:**This was an overnight flight, so I didn't get a chance to enjoy it. With that said, I think Incheon Airport and Changi Airport are two of my favorite airports.
* **Review of Chic Capsule Hostel:** Really friendly staff, clean ""capsules"" (essentially bunk beds with curtains), great location, but oddly same-sex shower rooms.



**Singapore to Kuala Lumpur**

* ~~Overnight train~~ Low-cost carrier. By this point in my trip (1.5 months in), I got tired of carrying all the luggage, so I decided to go for a low-cost carrier.
* 6 nights in the Hilton Double Tree KL
* 49,800 Hilton points (5th night free, Diamond status)
* **Review:** Oh my, this was definitely the BEST hotel I've ever stayed in. I got upgrade to Deluxe Suite for the first time. Just incredible service, solid breakfast in the executive lounge, decent location (with a food court in the bottom of the mall), and an amazing view of the Petronas Towers). This was when I became a Hotel Status believer. Unfortunately, there's not much to do in Kuala Lumpur.



**Kuala Lumpur to Chiang Mai**

* Low-cost flight
* 8 nights in the Holiday Inn
* 80,000 IHG points (10% rebate eventually)
* **Review:** Wasn't a huge fan. It's really far away from all the action in Chiang Mai, so it requires you to take an Uber everywhere. I thought the Check-In lady was really rude, the kind of people who will say nice things to you in English but say something nasty in their own native tongue. Definitely won't come back here again, as housing prices are dirt cheap in Chiang Mai.



**Chiang Mai to Bangkok**

* Low-cost flight
* 6 nights in the Hilton Double Tree Bangkok (5th night is free)
* 99,600 Hilton points
* **Review:** Couldn't get upgraded to suite, but I did get upgraded to a Deluxe Room. The breakfast at this hotel was amazing and the hotel itself was solid, nothing special. The DoubleTree in Kuala Lumpur really set the bar for DoubleTrees, so I was expecting more from this property, since it cost double the points. Probably wouldn't come back here. If you have some Hilton Points to spend, Bangkok has several properties that I hear are better than the DoubleTree.



**Bangkok to Siem Reap**

* Low-cost flight
* 2 nights at Siem Reap Hostel
* $20
* **Review:** Awesome experience, informative staff, and fair prices on everything. Great food, too!



**Siem Reap to Ho Chi Minh, then HCM to Hanoi**

* Low-cost flights
* 6 nights in Garden Inn Hanoi
* 49,800 Hilton points (5th night free)
* **Review:** Got upgraded to a suite again! Thank you Diamond Status. Really enjoyed my trip here. The staff were friendly, the food was great, though the gym was really small. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed Hanoi and this hotel was close to some amazing restaurants. 



**Hanoi to Taipei**

* China Airlines Economy
* 10,000 Flying Blue points + fuel surcharge
* **Review:** To be honest, I don't remember anything about this flight. 



**Taipei to Manila**

* ~~Low-cost flight~~ Used the Chase Travel Portal to book a $100 Philippine Airline flight for 7.8k UR. I wish I had the CSR, but at 1.25ppc, it was my best option to fly back into Manila. A semi-decent redemption in my book.
* **Quick note:** I wish I had the Prestige during my trip to Palawan, Philippines. It would have saved me some money when redemption wasn't available. If the card drops to a $350 annual fee, I might consider applying within the next few years.



**Manila to Tokyo**

* Japan Airlines Economy
* 10,000 Avios Points
* **Review:** I HATE JAL's web check-in process (British Airways re-directed me to their site). It really discourages you from flying what otherwise would be an amazing airline. Thankfully, I got a window seat and caught [one of my favorite shots of this trip](https://i.imgur.com/j6vlHH1.jpg).



**Tokyo to Honolulu**

* Japan Airlines Economy
* 20,000 Avios Points + $60
* **Review:** Though it was an overnight fly from 11pm, they still served an awesome meal. JAL, from my experience on these two flights, have amazing meals. 



**Honolulu to LAX**

* Delta Airlines Economy 
* 15,000 Flying Blue points
* **Review:** People hate Delta for some reason, but I think this flight had the best service of this entire trip. All the stewardesses and crew-members were so friendly.


And that's it! If you have any questions, please let me know :)

Happy churning!"

I'm aware of the amazing ANA F West Coast-Tokyo option through Virgin Atlantic. However, my existing points are all in other Alliance groups. 

I feel like one decision I need to make immediately is whether to plan on opening two new credit cards in 2019 in order to amass the points necessary to do the ANA option with Virgin Atlantic, or if I should work with what I have and research competing options.

1) I see booking one-way flights causes high taxes/fees for the return flight. Is there a way to avoid this or do I have to book RT to avoid it? I ask because I'd like to use up my Delta miles first.

2) Would spending ~3-4 days in 3 countries be a good amount of time?

3) Would using points for a ticket to the 1st country and then buying cheap flights to travel between them be the better idea?"
"2019-01-04 01:45:30"|"Delta One on 767 vs A330"|"Looking to fly international business class for the first time with my wife, and found availability in Delta One using Virgin Atlantic miles transferred from UR.  Flights are SEA-CDG, returning AMS-SEA, 100k + $51 RT per person which seems like a pretty good deal for a $3k cash fare.

Delta flies a 767-300 on SEA-CDG... but on AMS-SEA they have 2x daily, one the 767 and the other the A330.  From what I've read, the seats are very different and the Delta One product is superior on the A330, so I would prefer to be on that flight for the AMS return to at least try the other seat.

Virgin Atlantic is showing scattered availability for AMS-SEA, sometimes on the 767 flight, sometimes on A330, or both depending on the date.  On our preferred dates it's only showing availability on the 767 flight.  Searching on Delta's site, the 2 flights that day are the same cash fare and similarly empty at this point.

Is there any way to book the 767 flight and ultimately get our tickets changed to the same day's A330 flight by calling Delta or anything like that?

I posted in the r/churning thread a few weeks ago but wanted to post here to get some more commentary. Here it goes!

Flights first:

**Flight leg 1: MSP-ORD-HKG-SIN**

MSP-ORD: AA domestic F on a 738.  Plan is to hit the AA Flagship lounge while waiting in ORD.

ORD-HKG: CX F on a 773.  Wife is booked in CX J, and patiently waiting for F space to open.  Fingers crossed.  We have a ~5 hour layover in HKG, so looking forward to the CX F lounges.

HKG-SIN: CX J (no F on this route) on a A330

*Total: 2x110k AA miles = 220k AA miles + ~$100 IIRC*


**Flight leg 2: SIN-MEL-ZQN**

SIN-MEL: SQ J on a 772. Overnight flight.

MEL-ZQN: NZ Y on an A320.  Meh, but the sights should be decent.  I don't think biz was an option on this route

*Total: 2x50k UA miles = 100k UA miles + $103*


**Flight leg 3: ZQN-SYD-AUH**

ZQN-SYD: QF Y on a 738.  Meh again... gets the job done.  23 hour ""layover"" in Sydney (on purpose, of course)

SYD-AUH:  EY F Apartments on the A380. Very excited for this one for obvious reasons.  Not sure if we will bus over to Dubai or stay in Abu Dhabi.  Opinions welcome.  We'll have 2 nights wherever we end up.

*Total: 2x100k AA miles = 200k AA miles + ~$200*


**Flight leg 4: AUH-AMS**

AUH-AMS: EY J on an A330.  Day flight, lounge experience will be nice in AUH.

*Total: 2x42.5k AA miles = 85k AA miles + $60*


**Flight leg 5: AMS-MSP**

AMS-MSP: DL J on an A330.  Very worth it to go nonstop for the final leg of our trip.  Could have saved some money by mustering up some more AA miles and doing something like AMS-PHL-MSP, but I figure by this point we'll be exhausted and just want to get home.  Fees were ~$500 on this flight, so I used my stash of DL GCs to offset most of the cost.

*Total: 2x70k DL miles = 140k AA miles + ~$500 (minus $350 in DL GCs)*

***Total total:***

All AA miles (505k) were from AA card churning (65k mailers w/ 75k match).  All DL miles (140k) from Delta Platinum Biz+Personal.  All UA miles (100k) from wife's CIP + my referral to her.

.

Now hotels:

**Singapore**
Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights.  Paying cash from 2 x WF Biz Plat.


**Queenstown, NZ**
Crowne Plaza Queenstown for 4 nights - 150k IHG points for the 50k/night (4th night free with the new IHG cards).  Not many award hotels in this area, and prices (including Airbnb) are all-around insane for this time of year.  Crowne was ~$400/night if paying cash.  There was a Holiday Inn a few miles up the road for 20k/night, but we wanted to be within walking distance of everything.


**Sydney**
Park Hyatt Sydney overlooking the Sydney Opera House for 1 night - 30k WoH points.  If we're gonna do Sydney for one night, might as well make it special.


**Abu Dhabi OR Dubai**
Undecided here, but have lots of Marriott points to burn.  Looking for recommendations.  Currently have a decent Marriott booked in Dubai for 2 nights.


**Amsterdam**
Renaissance Marriott for 2 nights.  We've stayed here before and loved the hotel and location.  Wanted to end the trip somewhere comfortable and familiar.



Total is 16 days - a lot to pack in, but we're excited and ready.  The original intent of this trip was to do just Singapore and Queenstown, but the availability back from South Pacific was abysmal... so turned the trip into a RTW!

That should be bookable at 50k with VS miles, based on that OMAAT post. But when I search on VS for the same date, I don't see that flight - I see only VS158 and a connection through DTW onto DL16.

This is for a trip that I just completed last week.

My wife and I loved our trip to the Conrad Maldives last year so we decided we wanted to go back and the timing of marriott/SPG merger worked out well for us.

We booked BUF - DCA - JFK - AUH - MLE in First for 105K miles each.? Our flight from AUH - MLE ended up being downgraded to Business from First after a substantial delay due to a maintenance issue and were switched to a 2 cabin flight.? The crew was great and still treated us like first class and we were placed in the 2 front seats of the business class cabin.? Due to the switch, my wife and I eached received a voucher for $200 cash that we were able to redeem back in Abu Dhabi.? Due to delay and arriving in Male at 6 PM, we missed our seaplane so we ended up booking the Hotel Octave in Male for $97 and I would highly recommend this for a quick layover.? They provide RT airport transfer with free breakfast and the facilities are clean and get the job done.? For the layover in Abu Dhabi, I booked the Andaz Abu Dhabi using a free Hyatt certificate.

We were originally booked at the W Maldives for 5 nights but only ended up being there for 4 nights and the staff was great.? The reservation was booked under my wife's account but they honored my platinum status for free breakfast and 35% off all food and beverages.? We spent 340K Marriott points to book into an overwater villas.? The snorkeling here is fantastic and if that is what you like to do, I would highly recommend this property.? Our cost at the resort were as follows:

Seaplane transfer - $950 - $200 since we used Amex Blue Cash bonus to cover minimum spend on this.?
Snorkeling Excursion - $246
2 Shirts - $52
Food & Drinks - $420

We were able to get on the last seaplane leaving the resort and flew business class on Etihad from Male - Abu Dhabi for 27K AA miles.? The flight attendant that was assigned to my section was not very attentive and basically ignored me throughout the flight.??

We spent the night in Abu Dhabi at the Intercontental Abu Dhabi on a cash rate of $90.? The next morning we went to the Emirates Palace for ""breakfast"".? For $48, my wife got the famous Palace Cappuccino and I got the old topped ice cream cone.

We then took a cab from Abu Dhabi to Al Maha, which cost $95 before tip and $120 including tip.? We spent 2 nights at Al Maha which I found to be an all around amazing property.? The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in.? We spent 120K Marriott points and this propery is all inclusive for meals and 2 activities per day.? We did have some out of pocket cost thought which are as follows:

Spa Treatments: $356 including tip
Bar Drinks: $52
Car Service to Abu Dhabi: $200 including tip

We flew Abu Dhabi to JFK in Etihad business class for 63K AA miles and JFK to BUF on Delta for 6K miles each.

Total Miles/Points Used:

American Airlines: 390K
Marriott BonVoy: 460K
1 Free Hyatt Certificate
Delta: 12K?

The total cash outlay for this trip was just over $2800 counting taxes and fee on awards.? When you factor in the $200 bonus, $400 Etihad vouchers and each of our $300 Marriott card credits - we only spent $1600.??

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this and I would be happy to answer any questions that you have.??

**Point Balances**:

* UR: 300k

* AA: 315k (with 70k coming in the next month or so)

* Delta: 178k (with 65k on the way in a week or two)


1) I want to use AA miles to fly there. I should easily have enough for 2x RT Business class tickets. However, I see my options are Cathay Pacific and Qatar. How do they compare? Any reason to choose one over the other?

2) Is 10 days in Bali a good length of time? We also talked about doing Bali + Thailand and making the trip longer. If we did that, would just buy a cheap flight between the countries (via UR portal).

3) Is staying at 1 hotel the whole time a good idea? I have ~130k SPG points, 300k UR. I notice a lot of the SPG properties are really nice and barely over $130/night but cost like 10k points/night, to me that doesn't seem worth it to use points. Any suggestions?

I'm having trouble finding a good milesaaver business award redemption for 2 from Spain/Portugal to the US. My dates are relatively flexible - looking for a 14-17 day trip between 15 May and 13 June. I have 118k AA pts.

So far, I have found a good outgoing flight on Delta, so really looking for a return flight. However, I would be willing to switch based on availability. I am specifically looking to fly from MAD, LIS, or BCN to CRW, LEX, CMH or CVG. There is *no* business award availability on Iberia through the BA website through that time period, either inbound or outbound. I've searched MAD - MIA, JFK, ORD, and BOS. AA has some pretty good flights for 110k/135k pts each that go direct MAD - CLT or similar, but all of the ones at 57.5k are shitty and go through LHR.

For example, flying from MAD - CRW (my home airport), I would have to fly MAD - LHR, LHR - IAD, stay OVERNIGHT in DC, then DCA - CRW.

I have found one route that puts me overnight at LHR, which sounds like it could be fun to get out and explore London for a night (I've never been), but not sure it would be worth it.

The best routing I've really found so far has been LIS - LHR, LHR - JFK, JFK - CLT, CLT - CRW. Luckily this one is same day, but 21 hours of travel time. ~$700 in taxes.

I've looked at other nearby airports like LEX, CVG, CMH and haven't gotten any luckier.

I think I really just wanted to complain to people who would understand, but if anyone has any suggestions about how to improve my search, I would greatly appreciate it."
"2019-03-30 23:50:24"|"Question about Redeeming Delta Sky Miles for Beverages in the Sky Club"|"I was in a Sky Club at Hartsfield-Jackson yesterday, and I noticed that they sell bottles of Dom Perignon for $250. That seems pretty standard. That is about 2x the retail price, and that is the pretty standard markup for restaurants that sell a lot of wine. I do not know what the wholesale price is. I'm guessing somewhere between $60 and $80.

&#x200B;

What surprised me is that you also have the option of redeeming 12,500 Skymiles for the same bottle. That is $125 worth of Delta Miles, if you use the pay by miles option. This seems strange to me. You would think that they would prefer people pay cash, and there would be an incentive to pay cash, but they're letting you have the same bottle for half price if you use their proprietary dollars that cannot be spent elsewhere.

&#x200B;

Why would Delta do this? Is it a thing where they are just trying to reward loyal customers who have a lot of Skymiles. Or is it possible that they are trying to get people to redeem their Skymiles for things other than flights, because reward point flights are a big loss leader? I'm really stumped here if anyone is in the know."

"2019-03-08 05:47:32"|"Advice for booking business/first Boston to Tokyo in late 2019"|"Hi all- we are getting married in mid-October, and we are tossing around the idea of Japan for our honeymoon. I started doing a bunch of research about ways to book business or first with miles/points but am getting pretty overwhelmed, hoping someone may be able to steer me in the right direction. 

We have points spread across a number of different programs, listed below, broken down by mine (P1) vs hers.

Basically we are looking for: 

* Boston to Tokyo R/T
* Business or First
* approx. 11-15 days total
* Earliest possible date we could leave is ~10/16/2019; we?d consider anytime Nov/Dec, possibly Jan, depending on availability, pricing etc, but preference is late Oct / early-mid Nov
* We would plan to travel around Japan, rather than spending the full 2 weeks in Tokyo. But I assume Tokyo round trip is much more economical than open jaw?

Program | P1 | P2
-: | :- | :-
Chase UR | 328k | 218k
Amex MR | - | 60k
AAdvantage | 172k | 69k
BA Exec Club | 155k | -
Delta | 42k | 4k 
United | 123k | -
Southwest | 43k | -
JetBlue | 15k | 38k
Hyatt | 51k | 23k
Hilton | 5k | 20k
Marriott | 62k | 70k

Can anyone provide some guidance as to what I should be looking for, the best way(s) to search for availability, or any other general tips? Since there aren?t as many direct Boston to Tokyo flights, am I better off searching for award bookings from other cities, e.g. Chicago or LA to Tokyo, to get a better idea of actual cost of the main leg? Also I noticed that a lot of possible Bus/First flights I found were deceptive since the short leg, e.g. BOS-ORD was first but ORD-NRT was Economy. Are there other ways to weed those out? But I wouldn?t mind flying Economy on legs within the US (and am not opposed to 1-stop itineraries)

Or, would you recommend using some sort of award booking service to assist us with all this? 

Also we are both 3/24 for Chase and are willing to apply for new cards, Biz or personal. I might end up going for the SW Companion Pass (already got the personal Rewards Plus), though I know that wouldn?t help with a Japan trip. 

Thanks in advance."

"2016-03-10 16:07:03"|"Overview of Getting to Europe Using Citi TYPs"|"As I said in my [post on getting to Europe using Amex MRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbmd/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_amex_mrs/) and my [post on getting to Europe using Chase URs](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/49tbx6/overview_of_getting_to_europe_using_chase_urs/), I tried to do this overview including MRs and URs in one megapost, but it was too long for Reddit to accept it. So instead I decided to break it up into 3 separate posts on the issue.

One of the questions that I see on this sub (and Travel Agent Tuesday) pretty regularly lately is how to get to Europe using MRs, URs and/or TYPs. I recently did a [write up](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/introduction-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs-urs-typs/) that serves as a general overview of your options, the transfer rates, transfer times and your redemption costs for using your [MRs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-i-getting-to-europe-using-your-mrs/), your  [URs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-ii-getting-to-europe-using-your-urs/) and your [TYPs](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/part-iii-getting-to-europe-using-your-typs/) to get to Europe. I figured I would share that information and my write up here with the sub since questions on the issue get asked so much. I will also be putting together similar posts for redemptions to Asia, the South Pacific and India. These posts take a LOT of time to research and put together so please let me know if anyone sees any inaccuracies or incorrect ratios or information. 

*Please also note that some airlines will pass on various surcharges to you at booking. These surcharges can vary greatly depending on which airline's points you are redeeming and which airline you are actually flying on. While I do note some surcharges in this post, they are in no way a complete listing of the surcharges you may encounter. Surcharges are highly dependent on your airline and routing so there are too many variables at play for me to address in depth on this issue. This post is intended merely as a way to help get you on the right path to finding good value in your award tickets to Europe utilizing a transferable currency.*

Without further ado, here we go:

***Citi TYPs***

Citi offers a few cards that earn ThankYou Points, including their ThankYou Premier card (which gets a lot of my daily spend due to the great category bonuses for travel and gas). Citi offers a few other card options that earn TYPs, so I highly encourage you to head over to Citi?s website and check out the options.

Your TYPs will transfer to 12 different airlines across all 3 major airline alliances. Those airlines include:

Airline | Alliance | Transfer Ratio | Transfer Time
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
Air France/KLM | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Garuda Indonesia | SkyTeam | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Cathay Pacific | OneWorld | 1:1 | Same day
Malaysia Airlines | OneWorld | 1:1 | 2-14 days+
Qantas | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Qatar	 | OneWorld | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Eva Air | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Singapore Airlines | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Thai Airways | Star Alliance | 1:1 | Up to 4 days
Etihad | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 6 days
Virgin Atlantic | N/A | 1:1 | Up to 2 days
Virgin America | N/A | 1:0.5 | Up to 2 days

As I said before, the transfer times are just an approximation based upon data points I could find (as well as personal experiences), but it is important to be cognizant of these transfer times when you are planning your award booking(s).

Another caveat is that although I will be including general advice for getting to Europe on your TYPs, your home airport will play an important role in finding availability or determining cost. For example, since Cathay Pacific operates under a distance based award chart, the cost for someone traveling from the West Coast is going to be lower than the cost for someone traveling from the East Coast. I will also assume for purposes of this post that you would be flying into Paris (CDG/ORY).

**Air France/KLM (FlyingBlue)**

Air France and KLM share a frequent flyer program called FlyingBlue. Since FlyingBlue is a SkyTeam alliance member, you can redeem FlyingBlue miles for travel on Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Delta flights. FlyingBlue can be finicky to work with, but they offer some very good value for flights to Europe since their network is so large and established in the region. Roundtrip award tickets in coach which cost you 50k miles, while a roundtrip business class award ticket will set you back 125k miles.

One-way award tickets are allowed at 25k in coach and 62.5k in business, but no stopovers are allowed. FlyingBlue is definitely going to be your best option for a SkyTeam partner redemption and is a good choice in general for a coach redemption ? though unless you are dead set on flying a SkyTeam partner airline, it is not going to be your best bet for a premium cabin redemption. Be sure you are checking the FlyingBlue promo awards options as well as they regularly offer discounted award tickets on select routes!

**Garuda Indonesia**

Garuda Indonesia?s GarudaMiles program uses a distance based award chart, so your redemption cost will depend on your home airport. Garuda Indonesia is part of the SkyTeam alliance which means you can redeem your GarudaMiles for Air France, KLM, Alitalia, Delta, Czech Airlines or Garuda Indonesia (on their 5th freedom route from Amsterdam (AMS) to London (LGW)) flights.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~75k miles for coach and ~135k miles for business class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a roundtrip cost of ~85k miles for coach and ~150k miles for business class.

Although the redemption rates may not be horrible, the process for obtaining your award ticket is probably the worst I have ever seen. First you need to call the Garuda Indonesia call center at 021.2351.9999 to place your award ticket on hold. Then you need to download and complete an award ticket application form which you must take to a Garuda Indonesia sales office, in person, and then go back to the ticket office, in person, to claim your award ticket. So how many sales offices does Garuda Indonesia have in the US? Four. Yes, you read that right. Four. Encino, California, Chicago, Houston and New York.

In short, avoid Garuda Indonesia like the plague for award tickets unless you happen to live in or very near Encino, Chicago, Houston or New York and do not mind doing a ton of legwork.

**Cathay Pacific**

Cathay Pacific?s Asia Miles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Cathay Pacific is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Asia Miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~60k miles roundtrip in coach, ~80k miles roundtrip in business and ~105k miles roundtrip in first.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip in coach, ~115k miles roundtrip in business and ~155k miles roundtrip in first.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

What is wild though is the Asia Miles program allows you to make up to 5 stopovers, 2 transfers and 2 open-jaws at either the origin, en-route or at the turnaround point (destination)! That means you could put together an itinerary where you hop all over Europe, in business class, for only 80k miles total from the East Coast of the US! That is mind boggling good value!

If you can get the stopovers and open-jaws to work for your itinerary, Asia Miles should be a top contender for you to transfer your TYPs to for your European vacation. Even looking at the increased cost from the West Coast, if you can get work in some stopovers the value is still incredible here!

**Malaysia Airlines**

Malaysia Airlines? Enrich program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Malaysia Airlines is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Enrich miles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~54k miles roundtrip for coach, ~96k miles roundtrip for business class and ~132k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~72k miles roundtrip for coach, ~132k miles roundtrip for business class and ~192k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates.

While the redemption rates are actually generally not horrible, there have been a lot of reports of people experiencing issues when transferring their TYPs to the Enrich program. I would generally steer clear of transferring your TYPs to the Enrich program until Malaysia Airlines gets their IT department up to speed and fixes these issues.

**Qantas**

Qantas? Frequent Flyer program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qantas is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe. Qantas also partners with Aer Lingus, so you can also fly them on a partner award ticket!

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~70k miles roundtrip for coach, 105k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~130k miles roundtrip for business class and ~190k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~84k miles roundtrip for coach, ~126k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~156k miles roundtrip for business class and ~228k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Remember that you will be charged for carrier imposed surcharges, which means avoid British Airways and Iberia flights for the trans-Atlantic segment if you can!

Qantas? redemption costs are fairly high, so unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qantas miles that you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe as the Qantas redemptions rates are not very good.

**Qatar**

Qatar?s Qmiles program uses a distance based award chart, so this is another airline that will depend on your home airport for redemption costs. Qatar is a member of the OneWorld alliance, so you can use your Qmiles to book British Airways, Iberia, Air Berlin, Finnair and American Airlines flights to Europe.

From the East Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~75k miles roundtrip for coach, ~112.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~150k miles roundtrip for business class and ~225k miles roundtrip for first class.

From the West Coast of the US, you can expect a cost of ~85k miles roundtrip for coach, ~127.5k miles roundtrip for premium economy, ~170k miles roundtrip for business class and ~255k miles roundtrip for first class.

One-way award tickets are allowed at the half price of the above quoted rates. Again, and as with Qantas, unless you are based out of the East Coast, can get to the East Coast inexpensively, or have a glut of Qmiles you want to burn, you are better off transferring your TYPs elsewhere for a redemption to Europe.

**EVA Air**

EVA Air is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Infinity miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 68k miles for coach, 105k miles for business class and 170k miles for first class.

EVA Air requires that you make your Star Alliance award ticket booking through their reservation office. With that said, considering that Singapore Airlines has access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that EVA Air has, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines for a coach or first class redemption. If you are looking for a business class award ticket, you are better off transferring your TYPs to EVA instead of Singapore Airlines.

**Singapore Airlines**

Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Kris Flyer miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 55k miles in coach, 130k miles in business and 160k miles in first. Singapore Airlines does allow for one-way award tickets at 27.5k miles in coach, 65k miles in business and 80k miles in first.

Also remember that Singapore flies a fifth freedom route from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA). If that route works for you it will cost you 20k miles in coach, 57.5k miles in business and 67.5k miles in first for a one-way redemption. If you book this flight online, you will receive a 15% discount on the cost, meaning the flight will cost you 17k miles in coach, 48,875 miles in business and 57,375 miles in first. Although you must find your own way to JFK and terminate in Frankfurt for this flight, if it fits your schedule it is an excellent option (plus you get to fly Singapore?s A380!).

If you are looking to fly coach, Singapore is a program worth looking into. If you are looking to fly business or first class, there are better redemptions to be had.

**Thai Airways**

Thai Airways is a member of the Star Alliance, so you can use your Royal Orchid Plus miles for Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Aegean, Brussels Airlines, SAS, LOT, Turkish Airlines and TAP Portugal flights to Europe. In other words, you are going to have a ton of options!

A roundtrip redemption will cost you 70k miles for coach, 125k miles for business class and 160k miles for first class.

Keep in mind that Thai Airways charges fuel surcharges as well on award tickets, and from all reports I have seen, they are exorbitant. Considering that Singapore Airlines and EVA should both have access to most of the same Star Alliance award space that Thai Airways has access to, you are better offer transferring your TYPs to Singapore Airlines or EVA (if you want a business class award ticket) for this redemption unless you have a huge stash of Royal Orchid Plus miles that you are looking to burn and you do not mind paying exorbitant surcharges.

**Etihad**

Although Etihad is not a part of any major airline alliance, they do have several strategic partnerships with airlines such as Air Berlin, Alitalia, Czech Airlines and Brussels Airlines. Unfortunately, you are not able to redeem your Guest Miles for award tickets on these airlines. Etihad?s Guest Miles program is a dynamic program that has so many variables in its pricing structure that I could not possibly address all the possibilities here. I would instead recommend that you go to their mileage calculator and plug in your information to determine your mileage redemption rates.

For reference though, most of your flights are going to run well over 100k miles for a coach award ticket, so I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere to transfer your TYPs for a European trip.

u/workthrowaway323 pointed out (thanks!) that you can actually book AA saver level award flights with your Guest Miles. Like AA, Etihad uses a peak/off peak system for economy award tickets. Off-peak dates between the U.S. and Europe are October 15 - May 15. Roundtrip economy redemptions will cost you 40k miles off-peak and 60k miles during peak times, while business class will cost 100k miles and first class will cost 125k miles. To redeem you have to contact the Etihad service center at 888-8ETIHAD ***at least 14 days prior to the intended date of travel***. 

**Virgin America**

Virgin America uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. Virgin America does partner with Virgin Atlantic so you can redeem your Elevate points for Virgin Atlantic flights. The downside is destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 15k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 25k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 35k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 25k miles + $475 in taxes and fess for coach, 30k miles + $790 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 50k miles + $1,150 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin America also allows for one-way award tickets, but the miles rates are slightly more than half of the roundtrip cost.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are quite good, it is important to remember that your TYPs will transfer to Virgin America at a 1:0.5 ratio, so the redemption costs will actually cost you double the amount of TYPs. When you couple this fact with the astronomical taxes and fees, this makes Virgin America possibly the worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe and I would highly recommend you avoid this option unless you are just looking to top off your Elevate account and do not mind paying out of pocket the equivalent of what you can usually find a paid ticket for.

**Virgin Atlantic**

Virgin Atlantic also uses a distance based award chart so again your home airport is going to largely dictate your redemption cost. The downside to this program is that the destinations offered are pretty limited (London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Frankfurt (FRA) and Milan (MXP)) and the taxes and carrier imposed fees are outrageously high.

From New York (JFK) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 35k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 55k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 80k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

From Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) a roundtrip award ticket will cost you 42.5k miles + ~$500 in taxes and fees for coach, 70k miles + ~$810 in taxes and fees for premium economy and 100k miles + ~$1,300 (!!) in taxes and fees for upper class (business class).

Virgin Atlantic does partner with Delta on certain routes where your can redeem your Flying Club miles. Those routes include London (LHR) to Atlanta (ATL), New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), Philadelphia (PHL) and Salt Lake City (SLC); Edinburgh (EDI) to New York (JFK); and Manchester (MAN) to Atlanta (ATL). These routes will cost you 40k miles for coach and 90k miles for business class roundtrip. If you will be starting your trip from the US on the above mentioned routes, your cost increases to 60k miles for coach and 100k miles for business class roundtrip. It is unclear what the surcharges would be as Virgin Atlantic does not list them for Delta, but they should be less than what Virgin Atlantic charges for redemptions on their own flights.

Although the mileage redemption rates (ignoring the outrageous taxes and fees) are actually not horrible, the astronomical taxes and fees makes Virgin Atlantic the second worst TYP transfer partner for award tickets to Europe in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you avoid this option at all costs unless you literally have no other option.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully this helps some of you that are trying to determine your options for getting to Europe using your TYPs!"

I am an international student from Asia and have been in the US for a few years. Most of my miles are with United (as I thought United has good coverage in the US and great alliance with Asian carriers). However, I've been struggling now as I moved to Philly and most flights are with American or Delta. My goal is to in the future redeem miles for economy flights, mostly within the US or to Asia. I only have Chase UR points, not AMEX or Citi.

Would love to get some advice on how to maintain multiple programs and which programs I should credit my future miles to.

* AA flights: Should I stick with AA or credit to others like Alaska that has partners? I do have \~30k with AA now.
* Delta: Similarly, should I stick with Delta or credit to others? I have only 3k with Delta.
* I have upcoming flights with Virgin Atlantic, Jetblue, and Emirates. This makes me even more confused as they have many partners as well. For example, for Virgin Atlantic, I'm torn between its own program, Delta, or ANA. For Emirates, I'm torn between its own program, Alaska, and JAL.
* I recently found [wheretocredit.com](https://wheretocredit.com) but I still have a hard time comparing programs. Any advice?

"2019-01-25 03:12:33"|"Itinerary check/Advice"|"Hello all, 

I'm about to book 2 trips to Europe on 3 different tickets. Here's what I got so far: The travel dates are from 4/10-4/21, and 11/27-12/8.

28k on Delta, 100k Amex MR, 35k Chase UR, 150k AA + $600 in GC.

The plan is this:

* Use 25k on Delta from LAX -> FCO (April)

* Book a multi-city cash ticket on AA for CDG -> LAX, with a return flight in November. (So that I can use my gift card, approx $1.5-2k)

* LAX -> DUS, Germany (November)

* 57.5k AA miles + $500 in taxes and fees, LHR -> LAX 

I'm not thrilled with this plan, but so far it's the best I got. I want to use my gift cards sooner than later, which is why I'm planning on booking a cash fare. One way tickets are about double the cost of a multi-city ticket, which is where I got the plan to pair up my return flight and departing flight the way I did, despite the timing. 

I'm also not thrilled with paying the $500 taxes, but BA availability suits my schedule best so I don't see a way out of it for now. I was hoping by booking so far out in advance I could get an AA flight or something, but that doesn't seem to be the case. 

I could dip into my MR and UR points, but I want to set them aside for hotels for the time being. 

With all those considerations, how does this redemption look? I know it's not stellar, but it does achieve the goals of using up my gift cards and getting me to the cities I want to be in. 

Edit: Not sure if I'm blind or just a moron, but where do I enter gift card information on the site? I don't see it anywhere? [what I see at the check out page](https://imgur.com/a/qRa8S2O)"

We were thinking of going to Oahu since it seems like it would be relatively easy to get around with a baby but were wondering if there's any other islands we should look into. We are not planning to go hiking or do any scuba diving. We are mostly looking for good dining, beaches, and sight seeing that can be accessed relatively easily. Also if we could find a hotel that has free breakfast (Marriott/SPG gold or club lounge from SPG biz access) that would be a plus.

Preferably doing the whole thing in J but I'd be fine with Y in one direction if it makes more sense. Just myself flying, leaving sometime the end of October/early November. EWR/JFK preferred airports, happy to have multiple long layovers/complex routings.

* 100k BA Avios
* 150k MR
* 40k SPG
* 85k United
* 115k UR

My findings so far:

Economy:

* 40k MR -> Delta/Flying Blue for on Korean through ICN
* 42.5k UA/UR -> United on *A
* 45k BA Avios on Cathay through HKG

Business:

* 75k MR -> Aeroplan on *A (Turkish, maybe others?)
* 80k UR/UA -> United on *A (EVA, Asiana, ANA, Thai, etc.)


Can't do ANA because I don't want to book roundtrip and surcharges are high anyway. JAL is off because I don't have enough SPG to transfer. Can't find any J space for Korean through Delta/FlyingBlue.

So my questions are the following:

* Can I use AS miles to book CX? On the Alaska award chart it suggests it's 30k AS in economy or 35k AS in premium economy but when I called the agent said she could not see any availability from HKG-KTM on any day (even though BA shows availability pretty much every day), so I'm thinking there's something in the routing that prevents booking CX with AS from HKG-KTM?

* The Aeroplan website doesn't show nearly as many options as the United website, and United is showing some awesome options such as EVA/ANA/Asiana J availability. If I call Aeroplan and feed them the flights, will they be able to see them and book them? I just tried calling a couple of times but they are apparently so busy they won't even take my call.

Any other thoughts, suggestions, ideas or recommendations are welcomed! Thanks for helping out - you guys are awesome! :)

A friend is in Austria for a few weeks, and I've been tossing around the idea of going to visit while he's there.  It's not a must that I make this trip, but if I can find a good last minute award fare it would certainly make it more likely.   The days that I travel are fairly flexible to pick saver award availability, I just know I need do it in the next 2\-3 weeks.  I'm pretty well versed with options using United, and have found some decent options with them.  After doing an ANA F last year RT for 93k MR \(VS transfer bonus\), it's just hard for me to pay 70k United miles for 1\-way partner J to Europe.

Are there any ""tricks"" I'm not thinking of?  Thought I had been at this for awhile, but still learning new ways to book \(such as ANA via VS\) so hoping there might be something I'm not aware of to get to Europe on short notice.

Point balances are:

UR 290k

MR 200k

Delta 75k

United 25k

AA 125k

Avios 25k

Edit: I don't necessarily need direct to Austria.  I've looked for availability ORD\-MAD on Iberia using Avios, and Delta via VS to Paris, but given peak season no surprise there isn't anything.  I'm about out of creative ideas, so it may just be United/partners or nothing."
"2018-05-13 05:37:12"|"Trip Report; Maui/Kauai"|"Just finished our second Hawaii trip on points.  We went last year in early April and this time it was in early May.  Same hotels each time, but we received better rooms this year at each property.  Both islands seemed to be a little less crowded and it appears to be due to the gap between spring break and summer break.  Happy to answer any questions

FLIGHTS
Delta (ATL ? LAX ? LIH) and (OGG ? LAX ? ATL) (73,000 Skymiles roundtrip each; wife upgraded to Econ Comfort).  CPP = 1.2
We have flown ATL to HNL nonstop before; however, this was our first time laying over in LAX.  Layover was about an hour and uneventful.  The biggest surprise was that there were 83 open seats on the flight from LAX to LIH.  Many people, myself included, had an entire row to themselves to stretch out.  I can?t remember the last flight I have been on where there were 5 open seats, let alone 80.

Hawaiian (LIH ? OGG) ($132 cash each for First)
Easy flight.  First is $40 more than economy and gets free checked bags and a small lounge.  It cost $40 to check two bags in economy, so we booked first for the 45min flight.  The lounge tiny, but it is airconditioned and quiet.

HOTELS
Grand Hyatt Kauai (25,000 Hyatt x 4 nights) CPP = 5.8
We booked as a ?guest of honor? which allowed us globalist benefits.  We were upgraded to an ocean front club room on the first floor.  A higher ocean front would have had better views, but I was happy with the view we had.  Being on the first floor was also convenient getting to the pool/beach.  Breakfast in the Grand Club was nice and we enjoyed the light snacks in the afternoon.  Valet fees were also waived, although self-parking is just as convenient.  We were given a bottle of champagne at check in, but never had the chance to drink it.  

The upgraded room really made this a terrific redemption as ocean front club rooms were $1,458 including tax and fees (per night) for the same time!

Hyatt Regency Maui (20,000 Hyatt x 3 nights)
 As a ?guest of honor? we were upgraded to a beachfront room on the 19th floor.  The view was great.  The Regency Club isn?t stocked quite as well as the Grand Club in Kauai, but it was more than ample for breakfast and the occasional beer at happy hour.  Valet fees were waived which was nice because you have to valet at this property.

CARS
Used AutoSlash to book rentals on both islands.  Reserved a convertible for roughly $200 on each island (even thought Kauai was for 1 more night).

**Return Apr 16 BKK-NYC:**

**Avail:** Thai-Asiana BKK-ICN-JFK on Krisflyer 97.5k.

**Desired:**

*Option 1:* Again hope for close-in avails to open up on EVA BKK-TPE-JFK or ANA BKK-NRT/HND-JFK

*Option 2:* Thai / Lufthansa BKK-FRA-JFK for 112.5k in F (close-in avail)

* Debating option 2 as Thai/LH F experiences are really well-reviewed. But the extra 12.5k points is enough for a shorthaul NA worth about $100-200 and have to pay $300-400 in surcharges I think for LH... Is it worth it? I know it's subjective... CX/JAL I've flown in F and while it was cool, wouldn't normally spend more points to go F over J on those airlines.

**Thoughts/Questions**

* I'm trying to reduce the random buckets of points I have. I'm trying to use AA (as there's no other way for me to use those) and Krisflyer as it has the hard expiry. But would welcome suggestions if I really should be using something else.

* I'm really familiar with last-min avails on AA with CX/JAL and feel pretty good about finding something within 2 weeks. But I'm not familiar at all with last-min on the * Alliance - EVA/ANA/LH/Thai. Is it the same as CX/JAL? Am I likely to be able to find F avail on LH/Thai or barring that ANA/EVA on J getting closer to departure? How soon should I be looking? Ideally I'm not trying to search avails during the trip.

* If I did choose to go F, I'd normally book the ""better"" cabin experience at the departure, not the return but I'm reading a big part of the appeal of Thai F is the lounge/departure services so I've put that on the return end.

* Noting also that Songkran is Apr 13-15 so I don't know if returning Apr 16 is going to be tougher to find avails.

* I've travelled on CX/JAL but not the other airlines mentioned but appreciate any tips, thoughts on the itinerary, airlines I'm picking, or anything else would be appreciated!"

I noticed the cheapest tickets after some searching on the Delta website was 70k each way.  I transferred 20k SPG points for the 25k bonus which took 24 hours.   So since I only have half the ideas planned, I did a one way JFK-FCO 2 business tickets 140k total with a 2 hour stopover in CDG (only $50 total in taxes.)  

This is on the Air France partner and I heard better things with their business product vs Delta One.  It also worked for me because we got 2 seats together (if reverse herringbone even allows us to see eachother)  and I was able to use my 320,000 Hilton points to get 5 nights stay at the Waldorf Cavalieri with the king room.

So fiddling with different dates I noticed some 5 night stretches at the hotel only let me select the twin double, which would of been terrible obviously.  I know how if something works, jump on it don't wait.. so I'm just curious if this was all in all a ""great"" redemption or just an ""ok"" redemption.  

I also noticed after I booked there was a fantastic redemption on AMEX points with Alitalia but I had 0 of those points so oh well!  Just figured I'd ask the pros so I can be mindful for the future.

Whatever the case, I have to now figure out what else to do in Europe since we plan to make this a 2 week trip :)"

I also recently got the SW Companion Pass (We're in SAN). We have an upcoming scheduled trip to SFO in a month and I'm not sure if it's worth spending some points to stay there.

A loose plan on what we've got planned in the near future is: SEA, PDX & SJD for quick weekend getaways in 2019-early 2020. And a big trip to Japan in 2020 after the Olympics.

Here's a breakdown of our points right now:


Type | Points
----|------
MR | 87k
UR | 68k
AA | 74k
Delta | 19k
Southwest | 117k
Hilton | 153k



The lowest cash fare I'm seeing for 2 nights in SFO is $500. I'm not sure if it's worth blowing up my hilton points there, or potentially save them for an upcoming SW CC trip. I'm thinking that MR and UR will be valuable for Japan. What do you guys think?"

Available: 105k AAvantage miles, 100k Chase, 60k TYP, 115k Delta

Options (all around between 200-400 in fees) 

1) Delta One via Virgin Atlantic 47.5k (VA Miles).  Concern is i can only book London - Boston, so would have to have a 2nd reservation/itereray to get to London.    Booking via Delta (which would allow to reserve the intra-europe leg) is 80k

2) British Airways Business 57.5k (Avois OR AA miles) 

3)BA First (80k/per) (AA Miles & Avois)

&#x200B;

Essentially - is BA First worth 2x Delta One?  And - any issues with having two reservations to get back (one to london and the other delta one london-boston)?

The bag drop lines are insane, this is the only airport where I can honestly say I find staff to be in general just straight up rude, the ones who aren?t blatantly rude, seem visibly stressed to their limit.   Even beyond Delta, the gate areas are crowded, with not even remotely enough seating, food choices are terrible, you?ve got a Dunkin? Donuts, a Starbucks that can?t get an order right to save their life, A Friendly?s that always runs out of food, The only remaining choices are a few angrily staffed quick service places with limited menus. Now that Delta has control of terminal A, and will begin taking over all gates, I can only hope that they push for some drastic improvements to the terminal.  

My favorite airport is MSP. Albeit in the F gates it can get crowded, at least you can get from terminal to terminal without leaving security, there?s plenty of food choices both sit down and fast food. There?s plenty of shops to kill time in, and in the shitty event you have to sleep there, there?s plenty of quiet open space around the C/G bridge or in the A corridors, if you end up doing an overnighter on the floor. The counter and bag lines usually move at a somewhat reasonable pace. The Sky Club is always clean and well stocked. The staff at MSP just seems to give a shit. 

Honorable/dishonorable mentions: 

ATL- the mothership, plenty of food/space/flights, but can be overwhelming. 

MCO - Old and outdated, frustrating TSA. 

LAS - Spacious, clean, good food, and hey, it?s Vegas. (Occasionally long TSA) 

SEA - TSA is a total clusterfuck. Food choices are mediocre in delta area.

I've read mixed things w/ big people, some have good experiences and others a little bit of trouble \(but mostly they just asked for a seatbelt extender\).

2\) We don't want to check in any baggage, so we're packing light.  Just 1 or 2 suitcases for us to have our clothes and bring back some goodies, and a backpack or 2 \(mine w/ a laptop and hers mostly with books\).  Will we still have to do any baggage checking?  I read on Delta's site that you can have 1 personal item and 1 carry on, but I'm being overly paranoid here.

3\) How often are Delta's flights delayed?  So, we're leaving out of DAY and arriving in ATL to get to NRT.  We are then leaving Japan from HND to MSP to DAY.

* **Elements include signature cocktail, tray table place mat**

&#x200B;

As airlines boost profits by packing more passengers into smaller spaces, lengthy international trips have become increasingly cramped and miserable. Delta Air Lines Inc. hopes a refreshing drink and a nicer dinner setting will help make up for all that.

Starting Nov. 5 in the coach class cabin of international trips of more than 6.5 hours, the Atlanta-based carrier will start off each flight offering coach passengers a free peach and sparkling wine cocktail or bottled water, a hot towel for freshening up and an updated menu for on-board meals. Food will be served on a small platter instead of a traditional tray, with a place mat. Dessert and coffee will be served separately ?We?re providing choices with elements of service to distract people from feeling like they?re stuck in a metal tube for 10 hours,? said Jaime Jewell, director for inflight brand strategy and customer experience. ?It?s really about trying to take the airplane out of the experience a little bit.?

Flight attendants, some of whom helped design the new service, will be chattier and engage more with passengers, she said. The service was tested on more than 700 Delta flights between Portland and Tokyo over the past year.

Delta declined to say how much it spent developing the new service."

Because I fly where I fly, I take Southwest most times, but last week, I looked at taking Delta for the first time in a while.  I've boycotted Delta for many years.  I had a flight cancelled due to weather on another airline, but Delta picked up my reservation to honor it...without telling me that I was wait-listed for their connecting flight.  I only found that out after I got there.  My travel agent was beside herself, trying to figure out why they would do that.

I had to fly yesterday.  It was a toss-up between Southwest and Delta, since they had about the same fare.  Using my rule, I picked Southwest.  Expecting there might be a problem, I double checked very late Friday night, and there were still seats available on the Delta flight, at $397, which is the price I would expect to pay with less than 24 hour notice.

My Southwest flight got cancelled, and in fact everything that connected through the northeast was cancelled.  But since Delta was connecting through Charlotte, they still had seats...but...

The price at 11PM at night was $397.  By 10AM that morning, as every other airline was cancelling their flights, the exact same Delta flight was going for $1059.  That was an economy class seat.  First class was available and was even more.  I've flown to London for less money.  This is simple price gouging."

I understand that weather happens and can?t be controlled, but we sat on the tarmac for a few hours in BHM...we landed in ATL and I ran from D to A and got to the gate desk with 12 minutes left before departure. Only to be told that my seat had been given away and boarding was finished. 

Ok fine..I call the platinum hotline and they put me on the next flight (1 hour from that point) I go from A back to D....the flight gets delayed an hour and we are told that if we have less than a 40 minute layover we won?t make our connection in MSP. 

I speak with the gate agent who puts me on a WestJet flight that is direct to YYC. (Still don?t know why I wasn?t booked on this flight originally as I select fastest route) 

I walk to B...get a boarding pass with WestJet....I am taken off the plane because someone else has that seat and WestJet needs to sort it out (no big deal) 

WestJet was actually amazing the entire trip. 

So I get to Calgary at 1930 local time and my luggage is still in Atlanta. I speak with the WestJet baggage agent (because there was no Delta Agent on duty) the baggage agent gives me the forms and walks me through everything. Tells me that my baggage will arrive in Calgary on 4/15/19 at 13:30.

That?s great except I fly out on Air Canada at 12:30...

Now I am in Whitehorse Yukon and have to find a suit by tomorrow at 10am for a meeting. 

Delta has not replied to luggage inquiries while WestJet has been more than helpful with everything. 


After my last 6 trips with Delta...I am seriously looking at other carriers to meet my needs."

I am a 15 year old addicted to aviation and have my mind set on becoming a pilot for Delta Air Lines and hopefully later on in my career an executive. I have started flight lessons and spend all my my time researching flight, aviation as well as the industry, I truly have fell in love with it all, especially Delta Air Lines. The history and culture at the company is something I truly admire and look up to. I aspire to be part of such a professional, historic yet innovative family. 

I live in Maryland and often fly from a WAS airport to either MSP or BJI due to family. I have always wanted to see the fortress, Atlanta and finally have gotten the chance. I received a scholorship from Delta to attend the National Flight Academy in Pensacola, I'm connecting through Atlanta there (FROM IAD) and back (TO MSP). Both layovers are around 2 and a half hours. I definitely want to walk around the airport, see the concourses, as well as the plane train. I don't quite feel comfortable leaving the airport because of my age (I am flying alone, not UM) combined with the short connection time. Unfortunately that rules out the Delta Flight Museum and seeing the HQ/TechOps. 

Can anybody recommend any restaurants to eat at or specific things to see around the concourses? Is there any way for me to get tours of the ramp or the Delta Ramp Control Towers above the concourses? Is there anybody at Delta who's brain I could pick? During my 12h layover in Minneapolis I talked to many DL pilots and found that was enjoyable/insightful as well. 

Thanks for the responses, can't wait to visit such a historical spot for a company I am in love with!!"

"2019-09-09 08:11:04"|"Flew First Class for the First Time Today"|"I started a new job in February where I have to fly from my home airport of GSP to BOS and back once a month, which through Delta usually necessitates a connection in ATL. Before February, I've only flown a handful of times over the years. 

My company's reimbursement policy is for ""the most economical fare class available"" and anything above that comes out of my pocket, but they do reimburse for checked bags. I started out flying Basic Economy, but after a couple of months figured out that Main Cabin was also reimbursed with no issues. 

Last month, the hotel that is recommended by my company was booked up and I found a bundle deal on Expedia for a slightly-less-fancy hotel and Comfort+ that was cheaper than just the normal rate for the recommended hotel. I did the same thing this month, but the bundle included a First Class ticket from GSP-BOS and Comfort+ on the return trip on Friday. Plus, since it was a bundle, I paid for the hotel + airfare weeks ago and have already been reimbursed by my company so there were no issues with my bundle deal making it past the bean counters.

I think I'm ruined for Main Cabin and Comfort+ now. I'm a bigger guy, and having the extra space in First Class where I never touched the person sitting next to me was by-far the best perk. Here's how I rate the rest of the experience. 

Great perks for First Class: 

* All the space. Since only two seats go into a section the width of three seats in C+ and Main Cabin, the seats are wider, there's almost a foot of armrest ""neutral ground"" between the two seats, and there was plenty of legroom. I actively avoid putting my backpack under the seat when possible because it always takes legroom away, but I don't think I would have even noticed it today. The seats also recline further, but I usually don't recline my seat so I didn't test this out.

* Free priority checked bags - I normally just bring a carry-on to avoid extra fees that I sometimes gate check, but this time I checked my carry-on and with the little yellow ""Priority"" tag on bag it was one of the first off the plane. Once I deplaned, went to the bathroom, and made it to the baggage pickup area, my bag was waiting on me. A great experience.

* Drink Service before take-off - It's awesome to get a drink before you take off. Normally, I'm used to grabbing a coffee or soda to bring onto the plane on main cabin, because it can take a while to take off and get to cruising speed, plus another 20+ min for the cart to get to my location, but in First you don't have to think about it. Just show up, board, and get whatever you want within 5-10 min. Awesome. 

* Multiple free drinks - I get a single free drink in C+, but it was nice on my flight from ATL-BOS to get a coffee w/ Baileys, a Bloody Mary, and a Bourbon and Coke Zero. 

* Drink service in first even when the rest of the plane doesn't get a drink service. The short 30-min hop from GSP to ATL never gets a drink service, but I had two coffees with Baileys in first, one pre-flight and another in the air. Awesome. 

* Free meal - I received an email a few days ago asking about my meal preference, and I chose a chicken sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. It came with a fruit plate and Chobani blueberry yogurt. It's no different than any other meal I could have gotten in the airport for $12, but I didn't have to worry about finding a meal before boarding. It was nice to just walk around during my layover without getting into long lines for food while trying to make a connection. 

* Pillow and blanket - first class domestic passengers get a little pillow and a blanket. The pillow made the already-comfortable seat even better. I didn't use the blanket, but it seemed decent. Another advantage of first class - you don't have to plan ahead to bring these things?just show up. 

* Flight Attendant attention - the flight attendant for First Class routinely checked to see if any of us needed anything. It felt like being at a nice restaurant rather than having your meal dropped off at a QSR. The attendant on both flights was also much more personable than in my previous non-FC flights.

* 150% mileage - a great bonus. I'm going to hit silver by EOY (I flew a few times on AA and United to figure out which airline to commit to), but this will help out greatly next year when I chase gold. 

Not awesome, but still nice: 

* When my boarding pass was scanned, the flight attended took the time to look at me, saying ""Enjoy your flight, Mr. <Amator>. I've never had that happen before on a flight. 

* Small water bottles waiting on the seat tray. Nice to have early in the morning when I was a bit thirsty and could have an immediate drink. 

* The armrest with built-in cup tray. It was nice to have a place for the drinks to sit without having to extend the table. 

* The table was a fold-out from the armrest and not the standard seat-back tray table. This way, I didn't have to worry about someone leaning back in their seat and spilling my drink. 

* Little niceties like ceramic cups for coffee, cloth napkins, hot towel, and a little tablecloth for the fold out table. 

* Extra pockets in the seat back - gave me a place to park my Kindle and phone while I watched IFE on these flights.

* First class lavatory - I didn't use this on either flight, but first class gets its own lav so you don't have to wait and I've heard the amenities are a bit nicer.

All in all, I feel like FC has ruined me for other seating classes. I'm going to try and book a similar package with FC flights on both legs of the trip in the future. All of the other little perks are really nice, but having the extra space is definitely the best reason for me to fly FC."

I made Silver Medallion late in 2017, but received five segments with Comfort+ Upgrades that year. 

I went into 2018 with Silver and have so far received another five segments. In addition, I received a couple of gate-side upgrades and one First Class upgrade (I had a late flight out of Philly and the storm made most higher medallion members jump onto earlier flights). 

On the whole? Five upgrades a year is pretty fantastic. I would say that?s about 1/3 of my total flights. I upgraded another third of them myself. And probably got stuck in the regular section for another third. But at least, those flights were still in preferred (aisle) seats. 

Finally, you still get access to the Sky Priority/Medallion check-in line at the airport. Last Friday, flying out of Atlanta before the Christmas holiday, that was a lifesaver. 

I live and fly out of Atlanta primarily, so your mileage may vary. I don?t fly enough to earn Silver on my own. I use the Platinum Skymiles Amex to hit the spend requirements and get the MQM bonuses. But all in all, I?m pretty happy with Silver Medallion status.

We researched all the airlines for flying into JHB and decided Delta Premium Select was our best option for comfort on a 15 hour flight.  Yesterday, Delta calls us and tells us the plane that was supposed to be taking us will no longer be ready and Delta Premium Select is not available on the replacement flight.  Delta comps us with some vouchers and miles refund, but they have moved us into the main cabin, and sat us apart from one another and the site won't let me change the seats.

EDIT: Someone in the comments rightfully pointed out that the ADA is not the law in question here, it is the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA). Ignore my comments about the ADA, which isn't applicable.

He'll be almost 6 at the time but he's Autistic. He loves car rides so as long as there's movement he's good. We'd also bring his tablet and lots of snacks. The flight is relatively short as well.

Here's my issue:
JetBlue is usually the preferred airline option for most families with Autism. In our situation I weighed the costs vs pros/cons. My husband and I are both big - he's over 6 feet but we're also heavier. If we did JetBlue we'd have to get very specific flights so the plane was 3x2 or 3x3 so we'd be together, and Economy seats are pretty tight. 

The other option is Delta.

Delta has a Canadair Regional Jet 900 that they use for NYC to Chicago flights. In First Class that's 1x2 seats. 

Taking cost into account I realized the difference between Economy JetBlue and First Class Delta was only $150 difference! Delta would mean significantly more room, less people to possibly disturb, and a flight attendant much closer if we needed anything. I'd also inform the airline ahead of time that he has Autism.

My question is this: has anyone taken a First Class flight with a child? I know I'm paying for a service but I don't want to get nasty looks from other passengers, as that's a real issue when we're out in public. He's pretty well behaved in that it's not like we let him run around screaming and hitting people, but he could potentially get scared during takeoff and landing and he could stim at times.

Is it generally frowned upon to seat a child in First Class? 

Has anyone flown with an Autistic child on Delta? If so, how was your experience, especially if you've also flown JetBlue."

Throughout the year, I have received a survey for every flight and multiple SPAM messages reminding me to fill out my surveys.  Up until recently, I have not had a single issue with Delta and received a survey after every flight.  I expressed my gratitude and happiness with their service in each survey.



No exaggeration, my last four trips have been trips from hell all related to problems caused by Delta.  I have not received a single survey related to any of those trips.  I find it hard to believe that I was randomly given a survey after nearly 20 consecutive on time trips and have not received a single survey for the past four bad trips.  If we all received random surveys after every flight, the odds of receiving 20 straight surveys followed by 4 survey exceptions is basically impossible.



If I had to guess, Delta's system does not send out surveys to passengers on flights that may have experienced delays, overbookings or lost luggage.



It is my opinion that Delta is artificially inflating their survey responses and probably reports sent to the FAA.  This should be investigated."

I *rarely* fly, maybe once every four years, and I've *always* been coach/near the crapper, so you can imagine that getting a seat near the front and pretending that I'm almost first class is kind of a treat.

Long story short another passenger grabbed my bag. Her bag was still at baggage claim so we all knew who it was. The woman at the baggage office was like a pit bull. She wouldn?t stop calling this women until she answered her phone. In less then an hour I had my bag, and was on my way. 

On top of that the customer service manager gave me a card for 2,500 bonus miles! He was a nice older man, and thanked me for being calm and polite during the entire experience. 

I guess what they do is a thankless job, but everyone was amazing during that whole process.

We were not offered food, a hotel, or even our bags that were stored on the airline so we had to sleep on the floor in our clothes from the day before. To make matters worse, the airline employee working the front desk, stressed as she understandably was, slipped up and mentioned she overheard the pilot banged in sick after a night of partying and was too drunk to pilot the flight. This horrified and infuriated my wife and I. I complained using the Delta website but nobody ever responded to me so after a month went by I called customer service. The Supervisor on the phone was incredibly rude and said she could send me a gift card for $25 each. Completely insulted, she offered to up it to $100. So $200 for a fun night sleeping on an airport floor for 8 hours and taking unpaid sick time the following Monday because of Delta?s pilot issues. Has anyone ever experienced this with Delta?

?With the kick-off of the 2019 Medallion Year, we?ve made some exciting changes to welcome kits:

Based on Member feedback about materials, Diamond Medallion bag tags will be made of a premium metal and luggage connector loops will be made out of a more durable rubber.
Members who reach Million Miler Status will now receive additional premium bag tags featuring your highest-achieved Million Miler level. With this change, Million Miler Status will no longer be included on Medallion bag tags.
We?ve gone digital! With your membership card at your fingertips 24/7 in the Fly Delta app, Diamond and Platinum welcome kits will no longer include a physical membership card. In addition to the Fly Delta app, you can also print a card from My Wallet at delta.com anytime.
And coming soon:

Members who reach Gold or Silver Medallion Status for the 2020 Medallion Year (earned between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019) will receive bag tags so you can show off your Medallion Status with pride.
When you re-qualify for your Medallion Tier, or reach a higher Tier, you can expect to receive a welcome kit in the mail within a few weeks, so make sure your delivery address is up to date now. To make changes to your mailing address, visit My Profile.

These bag tags help celebrate just how far you?ve come. We?ll keep doing everything possible so that you experience the Medallion difference every time you travel.?

Highlights:
	- Bag tags for FO, GM, PM, and DM
	- Metal tags for DM return
	- Special MM tags

As someone who has never passed GM, pretty excited!

These are the airlines I've applied to:
United- had a f2f 6 months ago, so my time is coming back around
Frontier-rejected
Republic-VI (didn't do)
Virgin America- VI rejected
Delta- VI Archived.. Whatever that means
American Airlines- rejected
Skywest- couldn't make the hiring fair
Horizon- f2f rejected
Alaska- f2f rejected (but told me they'd recommend me to Horizon.. not sure if they meant recommend to apply or recommend me to the hiring team)

I don't really care about weekends off. What are the other variables we can bid on?

Also, how do you trade/drop/pick up trips? I understand that there is a system called Open Time, but what is it like? How do I signal that I want to drop my A days, for instance? I know I won't be able to drop them at first when I have no seniority, but how do I even go about trying? Is there any harm to listing them as something I want to drop?

Darn, but as it was my first attempt, I'm not totally heartbroken.  However my heart is really set on working with American Airlines as a flight attendant, and I totally plan on applying again when the next opportunity arises, but I need to look at my other options as well. What can I do in the meantime?

I'm definitely applying for other airlines and keeping an eye out for when Delta and United start hiring (for more than just a bilingual position). I have no experience as a flight attendant, and find myself wondering if I could get experience with another airline - would that make me more desirable as an applicant? Since Mesa airlines have a partnership with American and United is there a possibility of that being a good step in the door? 

&#x200B;

Or would it maybe be better to go another route by applying for a different Job with American? Getting my name and work ethic out there and known within the company, and so when there's later on a chance to apply for my desired job they know who I am, and I am doing so internally. I see that they have a Customer Assistance Representative position open, and as I have several years of customer service under my belt this wouldn't be a hard jump to make.

My plan was to apply for these companies in the fall when (I thought...) the three applications would all open at around the same time, but United just opened, so I have slightly less time than I thought to mull this all over. 

Questions I have:

1. Differences between Delta, American, and United I should consider in choosing? (Salaries, Unions, Scheduling, Time off, etc and more I wouldn't think of yet)
2. Benefits of Unionizing vs not (as I know Delta is not unionized)
3. Which airline would it be easiest to get a base out of California with? (I am definitely willing to move, but if I can be based in CA with easier access to friends and family that would be the dream.) 
4. I am a German major, and have fairly high conversational German, though I hesitate to call myself fluent- Is it worth trying to apply as Language of Destination/Bilingual? Can I apply to both bilingual and normal positions, or do I only get one application per airline?
5. (United Specific) The application for United that just opened is showing for Chicago- would it be basically guaranteed I would be placed in Chicago (initially at least)? 
6. Odds of starting out with international flights rather than domestic? (I am an International Studies major and dying to get back out into the world again:) 
7. Anything I should do to bolster my application/resume? 
   1. I have so far: Double degree in International Studies and German, a year and a half experience living in Europe with a lot of travel experience, German and Spanish Intermediate/Advanced language skills, working as a waitress now to get more customer service experience, and I am about to take an adult and pediatric CPR/AED/First Aid class.

I am a male, 21, in Chicago (o'hare/midway are both the same distance from me) and my contract for my work-at-home job just expired, and after being strapped to home for so long I'm feeling very interested in being a flight attendant as a career forward.

I'm sure this question gets asked a lot (and I've seen male F/As on my flights before, so I'm sure it's not an actual issue), but is being a male an *obstacle* for being considered? Do I need to standout more as a male to be considered? Or is it about the same? I know there's a stereotype (recently-crumbling) that F/As are females, but I'm just curious on any experience some may have on this.

I love flying, I have 3 years of volunteer (read: no referral) customer service (Xbox Ambassador Program - take chats/calls.. volunteer based..), 1 year of actual work with them (Microsoft Consultant, referral might be doable), but I am unsure how valuable these are as they're chat- and call- jobs and not really face to face.

Due to my previously very at-home jobs I don't have ""dress clothes"", would these be worth investing in if I chase this line? I have plain black clothes but nothing in the line of say, a suit, or such. 

Hair! I have pretty long (manbun) hair right now and I read that they have strict appearance guidelines. I'm assuming this means maintaining my longer hair is out of the question, and I'm more than fine with parting ways with it should I get the position - but can I keep it for the interview and deal with this obstacle if I get the job? Or will this impede on my chances of being considered?

I suffer from social anxiety so I trip over my words a little but overall I enjoy meeting new people and feel confident I can get through a one-on-one interview, but a group interview I'm unsure about. Obviously given the line of work, the group one is probably weighted a lot more. Any tips for calming my nerves, should I get an interview?

Lastly, I have no aversion to ""obscure"" or ""lower"" airlines (read:  not American Airlines or Delta, as those require previous Airline experience to begin with). Knowing this, which ones are the best to apply for and most likely to consider me for a position soon?

What am I doing wrong? It really blows my mind that I still didn't pass the assessment with my father's help. The emails specified that that was why they couldn't proceed with me, not because of my actual resume. This is the one job I've been set on doing."

I?m in the process of applying for Delta FA. I have seen photos of their new uniforms and am wondering if there are any options for women to wear pants? I don?t shave
my legs and hate wearing pantyhose. My everyday style is somewhat gender nonconforming. 

Also, I have some tattoos on my upper arms, and it appears that many of the female uniforms have sleeves that end above the elbow. Can women wear blazers or button downs? What are the more ?conservative? options for Delta women, with long sleeves and potentially pants?

Thanks in advance"
"2018-12-12 07:41:22"|"former military with tattoos and concerned about them"|"hi y'all I just got my first VI with Delta, I applied earlier last week.  I have military experience and recommendations that I hope will temper the lack of conservatism for having tattoos.  That said I know Deltas core values include honesty.

&#x200B;

I have three tattoos that are concerning.  

One is one my wrist about 1""x1"" and can be completely covered by a watch and not visible - had it in the military and thats the only way I was able to get in with it is that its completely coverable.

&#x200B;

I have two more - one on each forearm - about 2""x2"" which could obviously be covered by any long sleeve attire options.

&#x200B;

That said, should I maintain a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and cover them up with makeup and a wristwatch OR should I just be 100% upfront and hope that my military background will help temper the disdain?

Any other general tips to get the job are greatly appreciated!"

I'm a 23 year old male and just graduated last year with Bachelors but not having any luck finding a job in my field. Thinking about a new career and applying to become a flight attendant. Is that weird for male by the way? Also, I know height plays a role and I'm 5'7 but does being buff/heavy side matter too much? I want to see the world and I think this would be the best way. Otherwise I could go back to school for another degree, but wouldn't really like the mundane lifestyle and going on one destination for 2 weeks every year. I've done my research but would like a bit more current insight. I have 7 years of customer service in retail, will that be enough to help to get in? There's a opening at American Airline for bilingual speaker for Cantonese. Just wondering if there is a proficiency test to take? I can speak Cantonese, but I'm not exactly too fluent. At most I can be conversational and still communicate with people but I could practice it more. Is there any writing or reading test for it? What are the pros and cons in your opinions for being a flight attendant?  How hard is the interview process? What are the best airlines to apply for? I live in Atlanta but currently Delta isn't taking application. Not opposed to moving but not sure which airlines pays more and has a better benefits/seniority throughout the year? Would getting into a relationship be hard being away from home several times throughout the month or maintaining a relationship (won't be getting into one anytime soon, just curious how much it affects the partners.)

I am a aspiring FA, I would love to work for American Airlines or Delta. I want to travel and see the world even if I have to do it alone... 

My main thing is, has any flight attendant been out in a situation they didn?t know how to handle? 

I?m extremely scared I might do the wrong thing, i.e...

One time I was on a Greyhound bus, sitting in the window seat, 2nd row, a little old lady sat next to me. The bus gets a little noisy, the wind hitting windows etc...  Next thing you know this guy is going up and down the aisle, he starts talking about forgetting his meds and he starts talking (I think his references were) war, battle and his buddies. I thought anxiety? PTSD? I didn?t know what to do, he was just standing by my aisle next to the little old lady. I want to ask him if he was okay, but he was calm, just whimpering and mumbling. I stay cool, he touches the ladies hair, I don?t know if accidentally or on purpose and she whimpers, he says sorry. I really wanted to escort him back to his seat but all I could think about was Greyhound doesn?t do security checks, he could have a weapon, what if my intervention triggers something? I wanted to ask the driver or the man in front of me for help, but I was afraid. Maybe I was going to trigger danger to people around me, especially the little old lady next to me. The PTSD  guy gets closer to this driver and door, not sure what he?s aiming for, the guy and woman in front freak out and grabs him. PTSD guy then freaks out, and says I don?t want to hurt you, man says I don?t want to hurt you either but you?re putting my life in danger, PTSD guy says I just want get off the bus. The lady that grabbed him calls the cops, and he?s safely escorted.

I?m upset because I did nothing, I bought the lady a water bottle at the pit stop to try and comfort her but I practically did nothing. 

My dream is to become a flight attendant, but what if something like that happens on a plane and I don?t know what to do? How to handle? I don?t want to become a flight attendant and have my actions harm someone when I?m supposed to keep them safe. HELP!"

"2018-01-29 09:11:33"|"Do you feel the emotional assist animal program has been abused and what if anything could fix it?"|"In light of recent incidents and the harder line Delta has chosen to take regarding animals traveling on board. Do the rest of you (flight attendants) feel this program has been almost laughably abused? There is certainly a need here for disabled passengers. Obviously seeing eye dogs get a pass and some others that are harder to spot. Dogs that can detect and warn of an oncoming seizure for example or maybe some that help with PTSD.

Unfortunately, I have seen far too many bringing large and clearly not emotionally supportive animals on the aircraft. Even dogs that are obviously show animals. I feel this puts an unnecessary strain on other passengers comfort in an environment that is already uncomfortable by nature. Those that choose to follow the rules, pay for their pet, get a carrier, keep the pet in the carrier for the duration of the flight, end up looking like chumps next to those that flagrantly abuse this system and save money doing it.

I think a couple things could be done to mitigate this issue.

1.) Make an emotional support animal have to be of a handful of select breeds. No more just getting a certificate for Fluffy. If you need a support animal it must be one of these choice few and possibly come from a select group of licensed breeders.

2.) Not my idea but a fellow FA mentioned requiring insurance for the animal to travel. That way if the animal were to attack the airlines responsibility would be waived and the victims recourse would be through the owner.

My ideas certainly aren't perfect so I'm interested in hearing others views and ideas on this topic. Maybe many of you aren't bothered by the influx of pets onboard and I stand in the minority.

So I finished my live video interview for Delta a couple weeks ago. Unsure how it went but I focused more of showing my genuine self to them instead of rehearsing my answers back to them (that was my down fall last time) and I tried to be shorter with my responses.

Thanks! "
"2018-08-22 20:08:49"|"Tips and Tricks to Get Through"|"Everyone keeps wanting to know the same questions, so here is my summary as best as I can get. I have posted this before in and out of other comments, and hopefully this will narrow it down and help you. I applied to 4 regionals, got 3 interviews, (one I later declined), and got both offers from the ones I interviewed with. The one regional I didn't get was because I have more than 5 jobs in 5 years, and a non-visible tattoo. So, here is my thoughts to help you:

1. If you are serious about being an FA, it might take you a year or more to get through several applications before being hired. I strongly recommend you take any medical classes like 'First Aid' or 'Basic CPR' to add to your application. (both are generally one day classes and not expensive) Airlines seem to all screen for medical and fine dining backgrounds. I was an Emergency Medical Technician, and for whatever reason, it was on every application I did and helped me get through. Also, any high end waiter jobs are also VERY helpful as is bartending. Avoid having 'too many jobs' hurt me.  **** Before even applying, know the height requirements and tattoo policy. If you are too short or too tall or have a large visible tattoo you will immediately be cut. Don't even apply and go through the process as it's a waste of your time. **** Have a MATCHING passport and state ID. We had one applicant have a married name on her papers, but her maiden name on her passport and she was going to be cut. She could prove she applied for an updated passport and made it through barely. Make sure your stuff matches.

2. Have to do a video interview? Here is what you should know. Most video interviews are of you, answering a question in under a minute from your laptop or cell phone. Some you can do over and over until you get it right. I would actually set up a test ahead of time. Use your laptop camera and video yourself against a solid wall background. Wear a blazer and shirt, and make sure the audio is clean and clear. When doing your videos, avoid 'uh's and 'um's. Speak very slowly and also if you can, write down common phrases ahead of time and sprinkle them into your video interview. Things like 'I am a great candidate for your airline because I am on time, work efficiently, and am perfect at solving customer issues to retain customer loyalty."" Sprinkle educated phrases like this ahead to seem smart and confident. Anytime you can throw in '..helping you make an informed, intelligent decision about hiring me...' goes a long way. 

3. Going to your face to face? YAY! Here is what you should know. 

(A) If you are male, shave. No beards, hipster stuff, earrings, rings, tattoos, or anything that makes you who you are. Your goal is to look like a conservative bank teller. If you are a lady, dress conservative also, no wisps of hair in your face. use lots of spray and hair gel or product and tie your hair back in a bun. Hair should be off of the neck. I think if you have braids/dreads as long as it's tied back you should be ok. No black lipstick. No dangly earrings or anything like that. Google bank teller and that's what you want to look like. Dark blazers, dark pants. Conservative. Look the part. No hipster rings on your hands, or funky watches. One ring. One watch. Maybe a bracelet but I would avoid it. 

(B). Pick your favorite paragraph from your favorite book. Stand in front of a mirror. Try and smile and read it aloud. Read it very very slowly. You will be nervous when you do it, and so your brain will want to read fast, so read slow so it sounds normal when you do it. During the interview, you will be handed a safety paragraph you will be expected to read loudly. Smile, read it aloud slowly. You may be in front of a hundred people, so I hope you are confident in being in front of lots of people. I watched an applicant get up in front of a hundred people, freeze up and cry. Don't be that applicant.

(C) Customer turnaround. Know a well thought out story about a time when you turned around an angry customer into a happy one. Be able to smile as you are saying it, and get it to about a minute long. No 'um's or 'uh's. Speak slow, and with purpose. Pretend you are a stand up comedian in that you should be active, command attention, even talk with your hands if need be. If you stand up like a frozen nervous lump, you will get cut. I actually wrote mine out so I could practice ahead of time and could recite it reasonably well. 

(D) Interview. Mention in the interview how much fun it was to learn CPR and First Aid, and how fascinated you are in learning safety procedures aboard Aircraft. Try and slip it in there when they ask you why you feel you are a great candidate. It might help you get through it. Avoid cliche stuff like 'I'm great with people'. Instead say things like 'I am a master at creating dynamic solutions on the fly to help solve issues angry customers face'. They will look for steps to turn an angry customer, like 'Listen, empthathize, apologize, and propose a solution. (L.E.A.P.)

(E) RESEARCH your airline. I guarantee they will ask you 'What do you know about us?'. Go to the airline's website and know that they operate a fleet of 150 jets and fly to over 180 US Destinations plus Canada and the Caribbean. Know they have about 5,000 employees. Know they have 5 US Bases.

(F) If they ask you if you will relocate, ALWAYS say yes. 99.9% of the time you know the base you are hired for so you know where you have to move to. You can always decline later if you are about to start training and feel you don't want to relocate. 

4. Pay. Before you even apply, make sure you have two full months of money set aside as most training is not paid. Regional training is 4 weeks and up to two weeks for your 3-day initial operating experience. This means it can be two full months before getting a paycheck. Also, $18/flight hour is NOT $18/hr but rather about $9/hr. You don't do this for the money. Regional Airlines like Compass/Endeavor Air/SkyWest/PSA/CommutAir are domestic and fly from Canada to the Bahamas. Mainline such as Delta/American/United fly internationally and can pay as much as $28/flight hour, which is substantially more. Know the money and the facts before.

I've searched through the non-rev flight availability for Delta, and have found several possible routes that will get me there - RDU->SLC->MFR, and RDU->ATL->SLC->MFR, RDU->DTW->SLC->MFR, etc.  

My FA wife has never booked standby travel where there were multiple route options, so she's unsure what the best way is to book these flights.  Should I book just one of the possibilities, and ""wing it"" if I'm bumped?  Or should I book on all of the possibilities, and simply be a ""no show"" for whatever flights I don't use?  Should I book loots of ""single hop"" flights, covering all of the flights that I might want to take?

- I'm quitting my current job soon and want to work somewhere part-time that would give me good customer service experience for being a flight attendant. I'm thinking working at a nice hotel or restaurant. What do you think would be best?

- Is past working experience in cust. service really important in the hiring process?

Submitting only 1st year pay, no aviation professional(pilots or fa) may receives over time, and using 80hrs as a base rate/guarantee of hrs for the month. Per diem will not be included as the federal government does not recognize it as income. Just to add, an average per diem may be  $1.75/250hrs a month to equal around 437.50 a month. Profit sharing can not be included in this scenrio as many airlines do not have a program for it or its to specific of a  program for their work groups.
(confused yet? good!)


In a month(30 day month) an average 9 to 5 worker has 8 days off and works 8hrs a day, that is 176 hrs a month. Most airlines give a set guarantee of days off and hours a month to a flight attendant. In this scenrio we will be using the 11 days off and 80hrs of pay a month.

I recently applied to be a Delta flight attendant, and after lurking on this subreddit for a while (this has been super helpful in the app process, thanks for that!) I just filled out an app for Emirates as well. I'm a guy so I don't know how far that'll go. Still, I was really excited about being a flight attendant, but I was hoping that getting a position with Delta would be a great way to travel and get into the company with some work experience, but I was hoping that eventually it would be a good way to start moving up in the company internally. Say to the business side of the airline industry. I have a triple major BA in International Studies, Management in French, so I was hoping to leverage the management side of that after a couple years or so.

I was just wondering if any of you guys heard of or knew people who moved from the flight attendant position to something more corporate with Delta or one of the other big companies. It would be great to know if it's something I can look forward to in that position, or if I should take the job and focus on looking externally for more business-focused roles after a while."

So like the title says, I have a few questions about the above topics that I?d like to get some feedback on. 

1.) I?m bilingual in English and Vietnamese. Last I saw on Delta?s page, Vietnamese wasn?t one of the LOD choices. Does anyone know why that is? I was disappointed, but just assumed it was because it?s not as popular/high demand as the other languages? Idk. I mean, I?d still mention it in my app when I apply, or course, but was curious.

2.) I wear glasses and am practically blind without ?em. Never worn contacts before. Should I stick with my glasses for the interviews (video and F2F) or should I ditch ?em and try contacts? I?ve always been curious about this one and have never heard or read anyone?s thoughts on it, so I gotta ask... does it matter? I?d like to think not so much and that most airlines wouldn?t be too strict on this, but I wonder if anyone can chime in and tell me what they?ve experienced?whether you were the one wearing glasses or saw others at the F2F wearing glasses. I?ve seen a bunch of FAs (on YT) wear glasses when working, but what about before you become a FA?

3.) So rn I have a bob hairstyle. It?s fine if I keep it down and not tie it up for the interviews/F2F, right? Same dilema with the glasses bc I don?t think it?s a big deal and as long as I look neat, well put together, and presentable, I think I?ll be fine, but wanted to hear your guys? anecdotes about this one, too. I?ve also seen FA YouTubers sport all types of hairstyles, but is there a preferred style for each hair length (especially at the interview process)?

A bit of background. We both used to live in SF and I got a really good job opportunity to Atlanta and moved here late last year. She had always wanted to be a flight attendant so I encouraged her to start applying here in Atlanta (since it's a giant hub) and she got a job with Skywest in March. 

They based her out of Chicago after training and has been putting in domicile transfer requests every month and got it granted this month. Obviously we're both delighted to be living together again soon but I've been researching on what her quality of work will be like. 

While in Chicago, she had a whole lot more work (for United and Delta) and multi-day trips and was kept fairly busy. I looked at the Atlanta destinations (strictly Delta flights) and they seem much more limited and I'm worried that although she's going to be with me, that she won't enjoy her work as much or get paid as much as she did while based in ORD. I've also noticed the number of flight attendants here is much lower than ORD.

So my questions for anyone with experience flying for Skywest in Atlanta are:

- What is it like working out of Atlanta?
- Is it just lots of single day trips or are there multi-day trips?
- Is there free parking at the airport for flight attendants?

Thanks for bearing with me.

2) I don't wear make up at all, so I didn't for either video. Mistake?

I also don't have exactly customer service experience but I tried to spin my job, I work in home healthcare, as such. Is this also hurting me?

This is mostly because I want to work my way into the international routes. Might be a hot topic but any opinions on these three and where they rank internally?

To be completely honest I've based my past  jobs around this dream to gain experience. I've worked in nothing but customer service since I was 15. Food/retail and a five star hotel. I worked a stint as a TSA officer so I know most of the safety rules for airlines on the ground and a basic understanding of air safety as well as the unseen dangers FAs face.

I was embarrassed to say it at one point but I've had three F2F with AA. 2 with Delta. 2 with United. Then a few regional group interviews. But the more I see how competitive it is I have just been working on myself. I'm independent but I do have moments where I am more reserved. I also have a very hard time bragging on myself. I'm confident but its awkward to sell myself just because of the way I was raised. (Always taught to be extremely humble). I feel like I always undersell myself. I've been getting farther and farther the last few though.

I have fairly long hair and plan to go for a more conservative cut of course for these face to face interviews, but I look fairly young when go fully shaven on with facial hair.

I've been thinking more and more over the past couple years about becoming a flight attendant, and pulled the trigger on some applications over the past few months. I've spent some time reading over threads in this subreddit, and various AMAs, but I had a few specific questions here. 

1) I've got a F2F with PSA on Wednesday - can anyone lend any insight as to what they're like? I know it's a regional airline so shorter routes (and less pay) operating as American Express, but that's about it.

2) I applied for AA back in December, did the assessment a few days later, and then did the VI a couple of weeks ago. I'm waiting to hear back on F2F for them as well; any advice? Or am I just in the ""hurry up and wait"" stage?

3) I applied for Delta back in August, did the video interview about a week later, then the assessment about 2.5 months later...and haven't heard anything since. Although on Delta's website, it says my application is still ""under review"" (though its archived now). 

4) I know that, starting off, the pay is rough; how does everyone adapt at first? Also, in the event I need relocate (which I almost certainly will have to, as my current hometown isn't a hub), I've been told there are resources that help FA's help find affordable housing.

First I should say that I applied for two Flight Attendant positions already one being with Delta where I got the thanks but not thanks. First time, so I'm not too discouraged.

Anyways, I'm a twenty-five year old male and I'm interested in pursuing a career as a Flight Attendant because I prefer to work with people where your labor feels more natural in contrast to dehumanizing office work which is what I do now. I also don't like being in one place all the time. I love to travel, especially alone, and am interested in aviation. 

I have tons of customer and emergency service experience. I've worked in restaurants, I've volunteered as a Firefighter/EMT and I currently oversee Logistics for a company which does involve notable customer service.

Don't know why I felt it was necessary to share all of that as my initial question was regarding a pay cut as I've heard and see Flight Attendants make next to nothing, especially early in the career.

I've done my research but I guess I'm looking for inspiration and personnel guidance from those who have gone down this path. Would you say becoming a Flight Attendant was the best decision you ever made? In your opinion, do the benefits in theory, justify the low pay? Have you ever left a job where you were making exceptionally more and feel you've made the right decision?

I feel the calling to make a drastic career change. Hope to hear some stories.

"2017-10-24 02:58:36"|"Question for current flight attendants"|"I have a question for some existing flight attendants.

I used to be a flight attendant for a regional airline for a few months back in 2012. I was fresh out of college and had dreams of being a flight attendant. The airline had a newer crew base where I lived, so I figured it was a perfect fit. The base was only open for a few months and then the base was terminated. I was informed that all of us would have to relocate to the IAD base. I had some personal family health issues and I was not in a spot in my life where I felt comfortable enough to relocate. The company literally only gave us a week to relocate before the base shut down. I ultimately decided to quit. I did not give the appropriate two weeks before leaving and therefore am not eligible for rehire.

I received my FAA flight attendant certificate in September 2012. I have applied for both mainline Delta and United?s flight attendant openings recently.  I do not list the regional on my resume because I feel that would only hinder my chances when they see I was a flight attendant for only a few months. 

I interviewed with mainline American about a year after I left the regional and actually got to the f2f and actually got pulled aside with a few other people to speak with additional airline representatives after they escorted a large group out. The reps asked more detailed questions about my experience at the regional and also my reasoning for leaving. I was very honest with them. After, I was very confident and thought that I had it, but ultimately got a tbnt email about a week later. 

I feel that being open about my experience and my ineligibility to be rehired definitely hurt my chances with American.

Regardless of listing the regional on my application, I am still searchable on the FAA website.  My question is, If anything did happen with Delta or United and I passed training, would already being in the FAA Database and not mentioning my previous experience be enough for them to rescind a job offer?

Any input is appreciated! Thanks!"

Need to vent."|"My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point.

Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

"2019-01-29 11:02:23"|"Delta flights severely delayed"|"Edit: The reason for the delay isn't up for debate and it's not why I'm posting about this. Please for the love of God stop telling me it was the weather and just address my question. Thank you. 


My parents (68 & 66) recently went on a cruise and were trying to go back home to North Dakota. They were supposed to fly out of Miami, Florida with a connecting flight in Minneapolis, MN.

At 9:20pm (Eastern time) January 27 mom texted me ""We got on our plane late, had a delay on the runway, were conserving power, and then they couldn't get the plane started again. We're back in the Miami terminal waiting for another plane, but we won't make our connecting flight.""

I'm not sure how long the delay on the runway was. 

Mom let me know they got rebooked but it's going to leave over 4 hours later.
""Now we are looking at leaving at 1:00 am [January 28] They rebooked us to Bismarck tomorrow night, but said to check tomorrow to see if there are cancellations on an earlier flight.""

Mom texted me at 12:41AM (Central time)  that they got to Bismarck. That is on January 29th.

To me, this is unbelievable. Mom's notoriously nonconfrontational so I'd like to see if she's entitled to some compensation. I'm sure my dad was livid but this is outside his usual scope as he's never been the travel planner and doesn't even know how to use his flip phone very well. They're both in pretty decent health but mom hasn't had a great immune system since she had cancer 15ish years ago so I'm positive she'll catch some kind of cold, especially with this extended amount of time in the airports.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get some kind of compensation from Delta? Are there particular phrases I should use that seem to have better results, etc.? United has a policy on delays not related to weather and I can't believe Delta doesn't have anything on their website about compensation. I've always thought Delta was better than United, especially after that doctor got beat up on United. Thanks!"
"2019-01-14 23:02:45"|"Looking for a new airline"|"After flying most of my life with them, Southwest finally pissed me off with their constant delays and poor service (which it really is once you peel back the layers; they just sugarcoat how they're screwing you). I realize that Southwest was considered one of the ""good ones,"" but I'm now shopping for a new airline. I fly between Dallas and DC 25+ times a year for work.

Problem is, I already have reasons to hate American and United, pretty much the only other options I have (I have no reasons to hate Delta but they are never a low enough airfare for me to expense it).

I have Southwest A-List but it looks like status matching isn't an option for me, because American has that weird status challenge program that I don't think I'd be able to meet the requirements for (nor do I want to pay for the privilege of trying it), and I already have Premier Silver at United through my Marriott Platinum Elite status.

What's most important to me is customer service when it comes to dispute resolution (i.e. making it right after a bad experience), timeliness of departing/arriving flights, and lastly, benefits I'd get through the FF program.

First, I can fly with China Eastern/Shanghai Airlines and get a long-ish layover of 13 hours or more in Shanghai, which would be plenty of time to get into town, have lunch and see a couple things.

Second, I can fly Delta/Korean Air and get an 8-hour layover in Honolulu. This doesn't give me as much time, but it would be enough for lunch and perhaps a short walk along the ocean. There is also the possibility of a layover in Korea on the way back, though getting from ICN to Seoul isn't quick, so I'm not counting this in my decision making.

I've never been to either Shanghai or Honolulu, but both seem fun. The Shanghai option is a bit cheaper (about $100), but the Honolulu option is more direct and there's (edit: slightly) less total flight time. I've never flown Delta, but the return route is handled by Korean Air, which I like. I've never flown with China Eastern or Shanghai Airlines, but I generally avoid Chinese airlines when possible.

Anyone have an opinion on which might be the better layover? Thanks!"

"2017-07-24 03:09:43"|"Connecting Flight With Short Layover Worries"|"I am going on a solo trip from Miami to Tokyo later this year. I don't travel much so although I read *some* things in FAQs along with other sties that touch on the subject, I just like to get direct answers to my personal questions as it contains a few more specifics. 

From what I've read, it seems my layover may be a little on the short side considering I'm connecting to an international flight. I'm just worried that I might miss my flight and also not sure if I would have to pick up my checked luggage. 

Here's the situation: 

I am flying Delta and trip was booked on one round trip (Note: all times Eastern).

- I'm supposed to depart from Miami International Airport on a Wednesday at 8:40 AM and arrive at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 10:31 AM.

- There is supposed to be a 1 hour and 13 minute layover in ATL. 

- After the layover, the next leg of the trip is from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 11:44 am to leave for Narita International Airport.

If you have flown via Delta or have experience at ATL, do you think that layover is enough time for me to catch my flight to Japan, especially considering it's an international flight? Do I have to go through customs or another security check?  

I'll ask again at the counter when I get to the airport but does anyone know if I would have to collect my checked luggage from my Miami flight in ATL as both flights are Delta and they were purchased on the same ticket? Or will Delta automatically send my luggage to the next flight? How long does that process usually take? This might actually influence if I decide to take a checked luggage or not.  

I know the FAQ touched on this briefly but I'm hoping I can get more specific answers to my questions. I'm an international travel newbie, so I am just trying to be extra sure.

I should note that we live in NJ, and they would love to leave from Newark since we live only 30 minutes away, but I think I could convince them of JFK or LGA for proper savings. They probably won't be interested in a layover longer than an hour or two which might constrain us a bit (although some of the fares I noted above were either nonstop or short connections)."

If i were to take Korean Air, i'd be able to book the entire journey from Incheon to Buffalo under KAL, whereas if i were to take Asiana Airlines, i'd have to book a separate domestic flight (JFK to BUF) under Delta.


My flight route for Korean Air would be Incheon => Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson (ATL) => Buffalo, while the Asiana-Delta route will be Incheon => JFK => Buffalo.


I'm leaning more towards Asiana Airlines and Delta because it's cheaper overall and i get to try first class (even though it's on a domestic flight lol) for the first time ever.


The only thing i'm worried about now is whether i'd have a problem moving around JFK because i've heard that check-ins and clearing immigration/customs there take forever, especially since i'm an international student travelling on a visa. It's also my first time into the States so i have no idea how the airports there are like.


I'd have slightly over 4 hours layover in JFK, and my main concern is that 4 hours might be a little tight since i'd have to check-out and check-in again if i take Asiana-Delta. On the other hand, i have a 3 hour layover in ATL if i choose Korean Air. I'm also assuming i do not have to check-out and check-in when i'm in ATL since my flights are all operated by Korean Air (even though the ATL-BUF leg is gonna be on a Delta plane).

Has anyone had experience having to check-out and check-in at JFK from an international flight to a domestic one and how was it? Or would it be better if i just booked Korean Air since all the flights from Incheon to Buffalo will be operated under one airline?

I am moving to San Diego for work and anticipate flying a lot to the east coast (particularly the Northeast), and possibly the midwest in the next year. Previously, I used to mainly fly from NY to Canada and had status with Westjet, so I am only now looking into US airlines with rewards programs.

The 1 thing that I really care about while flying is having seats with extra leg room since my knees bother me a lot and I tend to work throughout my flight. I am fine with paying but since I only care about the space, I have been looking into airlines that allow you to book exit row seats w/o buying an economy + ticket. However, as I want to stick to 1 airline for the rest of my time in the states, I am also interested in versatility/best value/miles.

It seems that Delta, United, and Alaska restrict exit row purchase to status members until a few days before, while Jetblue and American Airlines let you just pay for the seat. However, I understand that different airlines have different quality rewards programs/coverage, so what would you recommend? Right now, I am thinking of going with American and JetBlue as a second option. Thanks!

Even though the buddy pass (S4) is not an amazing deal, the flexibility is excellent. My life is a little unpredictable and it would be worth it just to be able to cancel if something arose.

I would like to fly to Italy around March 19th, but I am flexible anytime between the 19th and the 26th. I'd like to return mid-April. I can fly out of JFK, Boston, or Bradley. I do understand Bradley would be a pain in the ass, but I'm just mentioning it because I *could* do it. 

I don't care which city I fly into as long as it's on the train network, but either Milan or Rome are ones I've focused on.

The worry has just come up that I might have to deal with completely booked flights in late March. I am of course willing to travel any class (Delta One would be super neato but that's probably a pipe dream).

So I'd really like anyone with experience to tell me if I should book a confirmed flight out and just use a buddy pass for the return or if there's a good chance I'll be able to get a standby seat.

Grazie mille.

edit: willing to sleep in the airport for one night if it came to that. It would suck but it would still be worth it for my circumstances. Ain't gonna live there waiting for a seat though."

Our flight was cancelled and the earliest they were offering flights was Monday morning. We switched and entered the standby queue for the next two days. We were also told that because it was weather related they would not put us up in a hotel for those three nights... we told them we don't have any place to go and they would not budge on that.

This morning at 6 we were at #1 and #2 in the line. Turns out that they ended up overselling every single flight from now until Monday by 15-25 seats, so standby was not happening for us. 

I don't fly often but this is utterly fucked up. Missing the memorial but going to be in Detroit for three days to see some friends which I guess is better than nothing.

Change fees for Delta, with Main Cabin, are a flat rate of $200, as many might know. Is it basically impossible to avoid the change fee if I want to change my flight to Friday the 25th?

Also, I haven?t purchased trip insurance. Would that be a decent idea to do if I?m trying to at least avoid spending upwards to like $350 for a change of 2 days?

So my SO and I are flying to the states for the first time in August via Delta and I'm concerned about the best options for our little one, as we're having her on our laps (this is due to cost but may be a *terrible* idea as she's pretty active). 

I've seen on Delta's site they mention child safety seats and CARES harnesses, but nothing that tells you whether they provide any of these (probably not the car seat). We're currently of the idea we'll have the little on on our laps/walk around etc, but we know she'll totally kick off at some point. 

So my main concerns are - 

* will she need a ticket even if she's on our laps?
* does the airline supply the seats/harness they mention on their site? (obv she'll need a seat if this is the case).

We have a guest from Australia visiting us in the USA for most of October. She'll make 3 stops in the US. Here's what I'm trying to do:

* SYD to DTW, preferably with the layover at LAX. Stay in Detroit for about a week. Based on my research, this is almost certainly a Delta flight.

* DTW to CLT, for which Delta offers a nonstop, stay a week in that area.

* CLT area airports (3 available) to LAX preferably nonstop so this can't be Delta. Again, stay about a week.

* LAX to SYD.

I want to avoid layovers as much as possible. There seems to be no way to do SYD -> DTW without stopping once, but the rest of the legs can all be done nonstop.

I would like the two overseas flights to be in premium seats, the equivalent of domestic first class, but not the overseas first class that turn into beds. I would like the domestic flights to be the equivalent of Delta's ""Comfort+"" class.

I also don't want to make her pull her (checked) bags back through security at LAX during the first leg of the flight, so that flight seems like it needs to be booked as SYD to DTW with a layover, instead of as two separate flights SYD -> LAX then LAX -> DTW.

The only ideas I have about how to pull this off are:

* Buy a multi-city flight on Delta with legs SYD -> LAX for layover -> DTW, then LAX -> SYD. Buy the other 2 flights as one-way tickets.

* As above, but include the DTW -> CLT flight in the Delta multi-city plan. I would normally use Comfort+ for this, but if it's First because I want the overseas flights to be that, it's not the end of the world.

* Call a travel agent.

I think I just talked myself into calling a travel agent. What do you all think?

American Main Cabin Extra (MCE), Delta Comfort Plus (Comfort+), United Economy Plus (Economy+) are economy cabin seats with some enhancements, they are not comparable to true premium economy service from airlines such as BA or Lufthansa.

In the last year we have seen several corporations convert from Premium Economy services on European airlines to Economy Plus on American airlines based on ""better pricing"". This is a downgrade. These services are not equal, American MCE can't compare to BA World Traveller Plus, United EconomyPlus can't compare to Lufthansa Premium Economy.

Unfortunately, this is catching out many unfamiliar corporate travellers who are not aware these Economy Plus seats are vastly inferior with much reduced leg room and seat width as well as regular Economy food and drink.

If you do have any say in choosing between these services or influencing your corporate travel agreements, please compare products directly rather than assuming equivalence from names.

Although I always remind any personal travelers I am looking after, not all agents are doing this as our commission is fee and not based on price, so personal travelers used to European standards are also being disappointed after flying the American choices."

Keep in mind I'm a 19 year old college student so money doesn't come easily for me. I'm willing to fly on a shitty plane to save money (if I even do save money).

"2016-06-06 19:59:04"|"x/post from r/travel. Never Flying Delta again. Ever."|"My girlfriend and I booked a round-trip flight from Boston to Orlando for a vacation. The trip was booked months in advance. Prior to our trip I actually called to change our connecting flight in the return leg of the trip (through Laguardia) and was assisted wonderfully by the Delta team. 

However, yesterday, we arrived to MCO at approximately 8:30 AM due to an earlier than expected return from our cruise. Our flight time was not till 15:45 so I attempted to change our tickets to one of two earlier flights to Laguardia (one at 11:45 and one at 13:55). I was told that due to our ticket (Basic Economy) we could not be moved to an earlier flight despite there being room on said flight. While I understand this is in the very fine print of the original purchase (as was incredibly rudely asserted to me on multiple occasions), I explained and begged that I would pay for an upgrade and any additional fee. Instead I was told that if we wanted to get to Boston sooner, we'd have to re-book completely and it would cost $400 per person. 

At this point, we felt defeated and headed to our gate. When we got to our gate, we received notice that our original flight (scheduled for 15:45) was now delayed till 18:45, turning our 7 hour day at the airport into a 10 hour day. Worse yet, this delay would have meant a missed connection at Laguardia, so we needed to completely change flights. 

I went to customer service and was told that NOW there was no longer space on either of the earlier flights and we are being rebooked through Atlanta at 19:30 and arriving to Boston at 00:45 the following day. 

Both of these flights were also delayed, and we left MCO at 20:30, barely making our connection to Boston and arriving at Logan at 1:20 AM on flight DL2300 from Atlanta. 

Had we been rebooked (even at a fee!) at 8:00 AM that morning, none of this would have happened. Every customer service rep at MCO was incredibly rude and dismissive, and when they did try to help they had very little knowledge of the flights available (for example, after being placed on the ATL flight, I was offered to be placed back on the delayed Laguardia flight, despite the fact that doing so would have gauranteed being stuck overnight in New York. Had I not pointed it out MYSELF to the agent at the desk, they would have rebooked us on that flight. 

I sit at work now, having gotten 3.5 hours of sleep last night, our luggage still in Laguardia, after spending 12 hours at MCO and a total of 18 hours trying to get home for Orlando to Boston. 

In that time, I could have driven home faster. Throughout the ordeal I was treated as second-class (sorry, they called it E-class) and never once offered anything (even an apology) for the worst day of my life. 

Sorry, needed to vent. "
"2019-04-30 00:17:39"|"Our airline got us on 2 impossible flights after our first delayed flight; What to do?"|" 

Saturday, April 27th, we had our American Airlines flight (executed by British Airways) to London Heathrow, where we had our connecting flight to JFK by American Airlines. Due to Weather conditions (They said so), our flight got delayed, so we couldn?t make it on our second flight to JFK (This flight even departed earlier). We were told to go to the connections desks, which after a long wait told us we had to stay at a hotel and leave the next morning to catch our rebooked Lufthansa flight to Frankfort (FRA). Here we had another connecting flight to JFK from Delta. When we arrived slightly late at Frankfurt Airport we ran to catch our next Delta flight. We didn?t even had the Check-in tickets yet; this caused us to never make in in time and we yet again got us rebooked at a British Airways Helpdesk. At the end, all 4 of us would split up in 2 groups to still arrive at JFK in the evening of Sunday, we insisted in doing it, as our last hope. We went as fast as we could to the Lufthansa Helpdesk to get our tickets, but they said the information provided by British Airways was not complete and the time period was way to narrow to still make the flight. After this huge disappointment we decided to cancel our trip, since our 5 days at New York would turn to 3, which just wouldn?t made it worth it.

With our already more than 24 hours delay, our airline clearly made some big mistakes. Off course we cannot help the first delay (since weather conditions), but getting rebooked twice on flights that were impossible to make (the Lufthansa helpdesk employee that tried to get our tickets confirmed this) is just not right. Now I wondered who is responsible for the mistakes made on our flights; American Airlines or British Airlines and what would be possible in terms of claims or other solutions.

I will be taking a flight to Canada from the US in the next two and a half weeks (Immigrating to be with my wife, which I'm very excited about), and I am low on funds that haven't been already set aside for this trip. One of the items I am trying to bring over is a $1200+ pc that I can't really afford to ship if at all possible. I am flying Delta, and they give strict guidelines saying it can't be checked into cargo (I had purchased a large, hardshell case for this possibility), but my carryon bag would be flexible enough to fit it. The problem is that the guidelines for a carryon are listed to be 45 linear inches, with the example of 22x14x9. My tower's dimensions are 20x17x8, which is still 45 linear inches, but obviously different than their example.

There are now a TON of dates on both for $480-$520 round trip. I'd say the entire August calendar is full of these.

The problem is, none of those fares seem to be bookable. It's a flight operated by Delta, but those prices seem to either be on Alitalia or KLM.

Delta is saying it's the responsibility of the airline that was flying the first leg (non-EU airline). The second leg from AMS is full so I have to keep the crappy seat.

Can I claim a compensation under EC261 since the first flight was into EU and the second flight is out of EU?

"2019-07-10 21:18:43"|"Rescheduling flights due to schedule change"|"I made a reservation from SEA to MAA for mid-November (Nov. 17, to be precise) using Air France website a couple of months ago. The itinerary was SEA to CDG (Air France) and CDG to MAA (Jet Airways). As many of you may know, Jet Airways went bankrupt, and Air France accommodated me in a different set of flights, but the exact dates were unavailable, so they put me on a flight that departed on Nov. 19. The itinerary was SEA to CDG (Delta) and CDG to MAA (Air India). The exact departure times of the Delta flight from SEA changed many times following this, from 11:44 AM to 12:52 PM and then again to 12:42 PM.

Now, it seems increasingly likely that I may have to make this trip to India much sooner than anticipated (late-August instead of mid-November). What are the most practical options?

1. Will Air France reschedule my itinerary to August without any penalties? My ticket is a refundable ticket with a $135 penalty and a $100 change fee.
2. If option 1 doesn't work out, and if I have to reschedule the dates, will I have to pay the fare difference on top of the change fee? The fare difference is currently in the 1000's of $s.
3. If neither option 1 nor 2 work out, will I be able to cancel without a penalty, considering my original itinerary was set to depart on Nov. 17 and also considering the changed itinerary was further changed multiple times?
4. Are there any other options?

Lastly, I wanted to add that I could not modify the itinerary online, the website displays the following error: ""Your reservation cannot be modified online. For more information please contact your point of sale.""

Thanks for your time!

**EDIT: I received a full refund without the cancelation penalty after 3 calls. The first two didn't agree to cancel without the penalty, while all three laughed in my face for hoping that I would be able to reschedule by three months for free due to a completely irrelevant schedule change. Also, the US call center for Air France handles Delta and KLM customer support as well. Thanks to everyone for your replies!**"

Pretty dumb question but this is my first time with KLM to go to Prague, Czech Republic from Southern California. 

I'm going to be in an Economy seat but I'm confused as which baggage policy I need to follow. From Southern California to layover in Minneapolis to Amsterdam is operated by Delta Airlines. 

From there, Amsterdam to Prague is operated by KLM.

I never really had to pay for my baggage this this kind of sucks but it seems like $25 bucks for Delta and $40 bucks of KLM.

But since my baggage will be checked in the whole time and I won't need it until Prague, hopefully I will only have to pay it once.

Now we?re looking to book and all of the flights have jumped to over 100k+ and substantially higher fees ($200+). So my question is what should our plan of action be?

So I purchased a three segment ticket from US with a layover in Minneapolis and Amsterdam to Prague. My ticket number starts with KLM but it is operated by Delta Airlines.

So on Delta website, I chose my seats with the windows because I feared that that I might be stuck in middle seats which will be just terrible.

I read on some websites that if you check in or arrive at departure line late, there maybe a chance for you to upgrade if your seating is taken or the tickets are oversold.

I chose the seats because worst comes to worst I will just be in Economy seat with the seating I chose. But I was wondering if I should check in early a day before or check in once I get to the airport.

I'm guessing the best route is check in once I get to the airport, and wait until end of the line to get on the plane. I don't have a specific date to land in Europe anyways. Plus I have to check in a bag anyways so I guess it won't make a difference.

I know there is like a very slim chance, but why I wondered why not try it. 

Thank you all

* They wheeled out carts with free snacks and water. Nothing fancy, just your typical in-flight snacks ... but very much appreciated.
* Every gate agent was able to handle the situation. You don't know how big of a deal this is. Instead of waiting in the 15+ people line at our gate, I was able to find a gate agent who appeared to be not busy (no aircraft at her gate, no people in her area) and asked if she could help. She was happy to!
* They were not only able to book us on a much later (same night) flight to an airport near our final destination, but they were able to keep our seat upgrades. Fantastic! We wound up renting a car and driving the 100 miles home, but it just made our anniversary trip into an adventure.

"2019-03-18 00:37:02"|"Caught between two airlines!"|"Hello r/flights. I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this but I?m in a major predicament.

In November I booked flights to India via Delta for spring break. I?m a student and this year of my studies is very busy, so this is the only time I have. Because of that, I paid more to book with Delta under the impression they would be available to correct problems if they arise. I was only going to be here for 7 days and I?m didn?t want to spend it on the phone with the airline. Two weeks before I arrived, my grandfather passed away. I was both crushed and relieved I?d be here to support my grandmother and help around the house. I just want to spend my remaining time here doing the small things that make family so precious like seeing her and talking to her.

Unfortunately, Delta and Jet Airways have other plans for my time here. Jet Airways cancelled my flight back on Saturday, I only know this because my dad is attempting to get a flight home and asked to be on the same flight as me, Jet Airways told him they can?t do that because the flight is gone. I haven?t received any email notification of this cancellation from Delta or Jet Airways, nor is this information available in the Delta app. They also told him there are no other flights back on Saturday, so to arrive in time to being my classes, I would have to leave a day earlier - cutting my 7 day trip to 6. I am of course very sad about this, but I understand that things happen and sometimes you get the short end of the stick on that.

Which brings me to my problem. My dad, recognizing that I would need new flights, asked the folks at Jet Airways to help him rebook the flights while we were at the airport (a 3 hour trip from my grandmother?s home). They said they cannot rebook any part of the trip because I booked it via Delta. So, I contacted Delta via twitter DMs. (It would be 50 cents per minute to call Delta, which could get astronomical with this issue and the notorious customer service hold). They told me they will rebook me to be with my dad, but that I need to contact Jet Airways to get my flight with them rebooked. When I call the Jet Airways number, no one picks up the phone and, as I said, the person I spoke with in person said he quite literally could not change the booking. Even if I wanted to talk to him again, I?d have to go 3 hours by car. After 3 hours of trying to get Delta to do something, they sent a message saying I needed to contact Jet Airways ?for my protection? and that there was ?no where further to escalate the issue.?

While I?m certainly honored that Delta had the CEO himself DM me on Twitter, I?m also feeling quite stuck. As you can imagine, I can?t afford to just pay for a new flight at the last minute (especially with ticket prices skyrocketing from other problems with Jet Airways), I don?t want to spend my remaining few days spending quality time with airline customer service representatives, and I do very much need to be home to continue my studies. 

Any advice is much appreciated. Good advice is preferred.

Currently I'm looking at a round trip flight that goes BNA -> LAX -> NRT, with a 3 hour layover in LAX. Normally, this wouldn't be any concern, but the trip is listed through Kayak's hacker fares, so its actually two tickets (one round trip BNA/LAX through Delta, another LAX/NRT through United). 

I've done some research, but I'm still not entirely sure how this will affect my trip and would appreciate if someone could help clarify a few main points. Primarily:

1. How will this affect my baggage? (ie. will I need to go to baggage claim in LAX and recheck everything in since it will be with different airlines, or can I still have it follow me straight from BNA?)
2. If my BNA -> LAX flight is delayed/canceled (or NRT -> LAX on the return) and I am not able to reach the next flight in time, will the airline(s) still work with me to get me on another flight?
3. Depending on the answers to the previous questions, will a 3 hour layover in LAX be too tight/risky? I don't fly often and I'm not familiar with LAX so I'm hoping someone with some more experience could give some advice.

Thanks!"

Just wondering if airlines (this was Delta) typically compensate for these delays.  They didn't explain why it was delayed.  Looks like the flight leaving Boston for Orlando was the cause.  I spent a fair amount to move onto a different flight out of Boston at the start of our trip due to a booking problem (my fault), so I'm wondering what the airline typically offers when they delay.  As far as I know, weather was fine in both locations, so maybe mechanical?"

I'm in the process of moving back to the US after a few years living in Europe. As such, I'm looking at one way plane tickets from Europe to the US. However, I noticed that it would be $200-300 cheaper to buy a *roundtrip* ticket (Europe>US, then 5 days later US>Europe). Obviously, I could just not show up for the return portion of the flight, but I'm worried about potential penalties that I keep reading about.

Specifically, this roundtrip ticket is with Delta. According to their [ticket rules & regulations](https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/planning-a-trip/booking-information/fare-classes-and-tickets/ticket-rules-restrictions.html), ""Throw-away ticketing - use of discounted round-trip excursion fares for one-way travel ""is a prohibited practice and could result in being charged "" for the difference between the fare paid and the fare for the passenger's traveled itinerary."" 

I've read on some posts that in practice, penalties are only given for people who systematically abuse this option. Does anyone have more direct knowledge on whether I should be worried about receiving a penalty?

Right now, round trip flights from PHX --> NRT are about $1200-$1300 (up from $900 when we first found out.) Delta wants $1600-$1900 for what was $900 a week or so ago.

However, the same legs of the trip purchased separately are less than $1000 (closer to $900)

I was wondering if it would be against the rules to book a roundtrip from PHX to SEA and another roundtrip from SEA to NRT? As far as I can tell the rules seem to be mostly about buying tickets for trips I don't intend to take, but I don't fly often so I'm uncertain.

"2018-08-01 19:53:05"|"Question about issues with skyteam codeshares"|"Sorry for the long post, I'm just curious if my sitaitons were flukes or if skyteam is really as incompetent as they seem in my situations and if there is anything I can do to avoid this in the future and I cant seem to find much elsewhere so here it is:

I bought a nonstop flight on Student Universe MSP-CDG to study aborad. I purchased the ticket as branded Air France but it was a Delta codeshare. Delta operated the flight as AF does not fly directly to MSP in the winter. I knew this going in but saved about $75 buying the AF version of the ticket. Had no issues, could verify my reservation on AF website. 24 hour window opens up and AF directs me to check in on Delta website. Delta tells me I have to check in at the airport. I call them to make sure everything is okay, they assure me its fine. When I get to the airport I can't check in at the normal check in counter,  have to go to the special services desk. The agent is able to verify that I am supposed to be on the flight and that I do indeed have a seat but tells me several times ""I can see the air france reservation, I just cant access it."" I have no idea what this means but she can't give me a boarding pass or check me in. She gets on the phone and furiously tapps on the computer for about 20 minutes. Checking in takes forever but I eventually get checked in and on the flight.  I figure its a Student Universe problem, but this proves to not be true.

My bf bought a United branded and United operated flight ORD-CDG through Student Universe and had absolutly no problems. he was able to check in online, verify his passport information, drop his bag without issue. A friend visits me and has the same exact iteanrry as the bf through Student Universe and also has no problems.

My family makes plans to visit me in France. They get a great deal through KLM's website for MSP-AMS-CDG and back and they are lifelong skymiles members. They bought directly with KLM, on the phone no less. All of their flights were either Delta or AF, they never flew KLM so several of their flights were codeshares within the skyteam alliance as mine was. When they get to the airport they have the same problem as me, the desk agent can view and confirm their reservations, but she can't access them/give them boarding passes/take their bags etc. They go through the same long process as I do, eventually getting on the plane but this time the culprit can't be Student Universe. I even bought a Delta branded Delta operated flight on Student Universe from CDG-MSP to return from study aborad and I had no issues so it seems like the codeshares between the skyteam alliance is the problem here. Edit: should mention on my family's travel back to the US they had no issues checking in. 

So I'm curious if anyone else has had this issue? What is the point of a codeshare if it is difficult to use?I have since avoided codeshares and probably will in the future unless the price is drastically different (and I know they can be), but I am wondering if we did something wrong that cn be fixed or if this is a skyteam issue?"

I phoned WestJet customer service, who said, ""No problem, submit the receipt, we'll pay for it."" So I did, but I got the damn thing in these knock off ""WestJet dollars."" I don't mind flying Westjet, but I'm not flying to Canada more than every couple of years, and frankly I'd rather have the money. Last minute plane tickets were expensive af.

I work in Deadhorse, Alaska but live in Knoxville, Tennessee so I'm flying a round-trip every six weeks. I just started a new job and with my old job, I could purchase my own flights all the way to Deadhorse with miles and then the company would reimburse us, so I was only paying about 200 for a round trip but my new job doesn't offer this so I'll be just flying from Anchorage to Knoxville so there isn't a huge need for gaining my miles with Alaska Airlines, so with that and also w delta recently dropping alaska as a partner, it seems it might be best to look elsewhere but at the same time I love that alaska gives you points for miles flown unlike most other airlines where it is per dollar spent. I'm not someone who searches out different airlines for greater service, I'm solely looking for the cheapest ticket. So I'll be mostly flying between Anchorage alaska and Knoxville Tennessee with the occasional out of the country trip, so I was curious which alliance you think I should choose??

"2017-05-21 04:58:40"|"Lost Baggage. Delta/WestJet"|"Hi,

Yesterday (May 19) I flew on a Delta flight that was operated by WestJet. I checked my bag with WestJet and that they are who printed the baggage sticker. It's a WestJet number. The flight was WS 1100 from Toronto to Los Angeles. The flight was meant to be a layover, and then today I flew from LAX to Ixapta/Zihuantenjo (Mexico) on a Delta operated flight DL 645.

When I arrived in LAX yesterday, my bag never came out of the turnstile. Toronto was the last I saw it. I notified both WestJet and Delta (who are right beside each other at LAX) but neither cared and didn't ultimately know who was responsible for it, and how to proceed, or how the bag even goes from Toronto ultimately to Mexico. Yesterday, one lady at Delta baggage services (LAX) told me my bag would ultimately end up in Mexico today , since the flight to LAX was a layover. Still she couldn't actually verify this. That was really the only attempt at an answer I got.

Well today came and when I got off the DL 645 there was no bag here in Mexico.

My question is how do I proceed with this? Neither Delta or WestJet knows how to track it. I don't even know if it made it from Toronto to Los Angeles on WS 1100, let alone from LA to Mexico today.

Please. Anything would help.

"2017-01-01 18:23:31"|"Delta Airline's fraud team and my nearly ruined trip."|"TLDR: My ticket was flagged as fraud by Delta Airlines, and I almost missed my whole trip because of it.

About two weeks ago, I purchased a ticket on Delta Airlines through Kayak. Everything was fine, up until New Years Eve - the day before my flight. On New Years Eve, I attempted to check-in to my flight and received an error message saying I had to check-in at a kiosk. Now nervous about my ticket, I decided to travel to the airport at 10:30pm on New Years Eve to make sure everything was okay. Upon arrival, I entered my flight details into a kiosk, as I was earlier told to do, and received another error message: Please see a Ticketing Agent. 

Now I was very worried so I decide to call Delta customer service. At first, I was told my ticket was ""randomly selected"" in a control process, and I must bring my credit card that I used to purchase my ticket to the kiosk in order to get my tickets. Problem is... I had just received a new credit card in the mail two days ago and didn't have the original. I told the representative this, and he said it would be fine, as long as I have my driver's license on my person. But the explanation sounded fishy to me... and I was still nervous.

So I called Delta customer service again and this time got a supervisor. The supervisor told me my purchase was flagged as fraud by their internal fraud team **during the 5 minutes I spent purchasing the ticket through Kayak. How odd is that??** For that reason, I must bring my original credit card to the counter in order to get my tickets ... which I don't have. After spending nearly 1.5 hours dealing with this on New Years Eve... the supervisor refunded and reissued my ticket on my new card.

However the issue still remains ... ***what if I hadn't been suspicious of Delta's initial explanation***? I wouldn't have been able to get on my flight. Their security requirement of bringing the original card for suspected fraudulent transactions initially sound reasonable. But what if this had been a family member purchasing a ticket for their child in another state? Or a similar situation of someone who recently got a new credit card? Anyone could easily miss a trip they had already paid for because of this. Worse yet, if Delta wants to put their customers through a ""fraud review"", shouldn't they have more information about their customer than a three minute on-line purchase with Kayak? Shouldn't they have an obligation to notify the customer with a huge advisory notice on their ticket confirmation that additional credit card information is needed at the airport to validate travel?

Posting on here to see if anyone else has experienced this.

Let me get this out of the way first, I made a poor decision in my haste to try and save some money, and should have done things differently. With that out of the way (please don't let me know I should have done it differently, I understand that already), here's my question:

I recently booked a flight through JustFly.com that won't be until May. I'm pretty sure about the dates, but there's a very slim chance that things might happen that would make it not work to travel then. Wanted to book early though to try and get a better deal, since if the things happen they wouldn't be happening till like a week before the scheduled flight at the earliest. So, I did what I thought was smart and bought the ""Extended Cancellation Policy,"" thinking that it would give me flexibility to cancel the flight if something came up.

I misread the policy, and turns out it just means that you can can cancel within 24 hours of *purchase* without paying the extra JustFly fees. I thought it meant I'd be able to cancel up to 24 hours from the flight date.

Okay, all that aside, my question is, is there any way to try and negotiate directly with the airline (it's Delta in this case) in the event that I need to try and move the flight? Or am I locked into whatever JustFly wants to do with it? Basically I'm in a position where it's 95% certain that the dates I booked will work just fine, but there's that slim possibility that a week or less before the flight, something could crop up that'll make it not possible to leave then.

Then out of the blue the vent above the aisle started leaking water...and not a drip here and there... it was a pretty considerable amount of water and it was pouring right onto aisle seat that my sister was seated in.

Clearly eager to get everyome seated the other flight attendant (in charge?) told us that the flight was overbooked and that if we ""didn't want to fly with them (us)"" we could get off. After some complaining said flight attendant found a crewmember catching a ride back elsewhere and profusely apologized to him (but nevee to us) before asking him to switch seats with my sister. On the way out my sister thanked the crewmember who switched seats with her. Seeing this the FA must have expected a thank you as well because when she didn't get one she blurted out ""not even a thank you?"".

I called delta and with a change fee they want $380 per ticket to fly out the day I want. we need two tickets and we paid about $400 a piece originally.

I have looked online and I can get a one way ticket on that flight for $180. The problem is it looks like if I miss my initial flight on the 21st, they cancel my return trip.

also looking online it seems if I change my ticket day of the flight it's a $75 change fee, but I couldn't tell if the flight had to be same day or what.

I understand we'll do customs upon entry, so that would certainly eat into the time.  We are going on backpacking trip so probably half of the packs would be small enough to carry on and the other half to check.  ATL to TOR is WestJet serviced by Delta and TOR to Calgary is Westjet.

So a few years ago, like in 2007 or something, I had purchased a round trip ticket from Jet Blue from Long Beach, CA to JFK or LGA (I forgot which it was, but it was NY).  I was scheduled to return to Long Beach on Monday, leaving at 6am in the morning.  At around 11 pm at night, as I am sleeping, I get a phone call.  I finally decide to answer it but it's already gone to voicemail.  Turns out to be a recorded message saying ""due to weather conditions, your Jet Blue flight has been cancelled.  Please check jetblue.com to reschedule your flight"".  So I immediately log on to jetblue and discover that ALL the flights to Long Beach are booked until WEDNESDAY.  So i call them and beg them to get me on a flight because I have to get to work on Monday.  Sorry, they say, we are booked until Wednesday.  What's that?  Oh, sorry we don't partner with other airlines so we can't get you on another flight with anyone else.  What's that? Oh, I'm really sorry, I know it's not raining but it might be tomorrow morning.  What's that?  Oh, don't worry, we will refund you the unused portion of your ticket. 

God I was pissed.  I had to go to Delta to get a flight out at 5pm and got back to Los Angeles at 11 pm and I paid $800, that was the CHEAPEST one way ticket they had for Monday.  Jet Blue refused to re-imburse me for it.  The worst part of it was that Delta is based out of LAX.  So after I got back, I had to hail a cab to drive me to Long Beach to pick up my car at Jet Blue.  They even refused to pay for that!  I was so mad I called them after fuming about it for a few days and they gave me a link and told me to fill out my complaint (or send an email to someone, I forgot, it was a while ago) so I did that and they sent me a $50 gift voucher for a future Jet Blue flight.  Sorry, that's the best we can do sir.

In light of the [doctor being violently dragged off of a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/64jmub/doctor_violently_dragged_from_overbooked_united/) and the resulting social media backlash, I decided to do some digging into what airlines do when it comes to overbooking. All of the below information came from each individual airline's Contract of Carriage, which can be found on their websites (I've provided links to the ones I researched). Naturally I'm not going to have everyone's preferred airline, so don't hate on me too bad if I didn't include your go-to. 

Per regulations, every airline asks for volunteers to give up their spot for compensation. After that, airlines can set their own rules to decide who gets left behind. Now then, in no particular order...

**United Airlines** looks at several variables: Fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and time of check-in without advanced seat assignment. Basically if you're not a loyal customer and/or early bird, you might not want to get too comfortable in your seat. [Read United's full policy here - Rule 25](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec25)

**Southwest Airlines** is pretty simple. The person in the last boarding position will be denied boarding, regardless of fare. [Read Southwest's full policy here - Page 39](https://www.southwest.com/assets/pdfs/corporate-commitments/contract-of-carriage.pdf)

**American Airlines** bases the decision primarily on check-in time, but also takes severe hardships, fare paid, and frequent flyer status into consideration sometimes as well. [Read American's full policy here](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#oversales)

**Delta Airlines** has a pretty complex policy. Essentially, if you paid a premium fare, you have nothing to worry about. That said, passengers with boarding passes are safer than those who don't have them or didn't check in. In those cases, rebooked passengers or frequent flyers are safer than a passenger who didn't check in and doesn't have a boarding pass. Exception: Special needs passengers (disabilities, unaccompanied minors, etc.) are likely good to go no matter what. [Read Delta's full policy here - Rule 245 on Page 42](http://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract_of_carriage_dom.pdf)

**Frontier Airlines** has a policy about as simple as Southwest. Passengers who check in after all seats have been assigned won't get a seat. [Read Frontier's full policy here](https://www.flyfrontier.com/legal/contract-of-carriage/)

**Alaska Airlines** favors the early bird. Anyone with a confirmed seat assignment won't get booted. Don't have one? Show up early and you're more likely to get a seat. [Read Alaska's full policy here](https://www.alaskaair.com/~/media/Files/PDF/contract-of-carriage/Alaska-Airlines-Contract-of-Carriage.pdf?INT=AS_Legal_||20160816_CoC_ENG||)

**So you've been involuntarily bumped. Now what?** If they can still get you to your destination within an hour on a different flight, airlines aren't required to pay you anything. If you get there between 60-119 minutes after your scheduled arrival, you're owed 200% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $675). If you arrive 120 minutes or longer, you're owed 400% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $1350). There's other small print to go through, but that's the gist.

Hopefully this is a little bit helpful. It was somewhat eye-opening to realize that this wasn't just a United Airlines thing."

I am not checking any luggage so I am not concerned with lost items. My biggest concern is flight delays, as that seems to be a pretty frequent complaint.

We always preboard with our 7-year-old son Henry, who is on the autism spectrum, because the boarding process can be very overwhelming for him (crowds, noise, etc). After boarding in Minneapolis, a flight attendant named Natalie came over to introduce herself and see if Henry needed anything. The kiddo immediately took a shine to her and started asking all sorts of questions about the plane. Natalie went out of her way to bring over demo oxygen masks and life jackets for Henry to look at. She surprised him with a chocolate bar and extra cookies. She listened as he talked about being on the spectrum and about how loud noises bothered him. After finding out that his birthday was the previous week, she got together with the other flight attendants and made a crown of cookie packages for him to wear and came over to wish him a happy birthday. She arranged for the pilot to come over the intercom and give a special welcome to Henry and thank him for his help during the flight. She was a friend to a little boy who doesn't always feel like he has too many of those. When the flight landed at LaGuardia, the pilot presented him with special golden wings (just like the pilots wear), let him try on his hat, and then the crew got together for pictures.

Natalie and the rest of team on Delta Flight 1596 went above and beyond the call of duty to help him feel special. Henry later said that he ""felt like a FIRST CLASS passenger"" and said that he would ""never forget my best friend Natalie."" You can't get much better than that."

I'm still processing what ended up being one of the worst nights of my life on what should have been the trip of a lifetime.  A single United Airlines maintenance guy managed to ruin **everybody's** night, cost me $1100 and I never even saw what the guy looked like.  Hopefully, one or two things will happen as a result of this post - Someone might help me understand how to make this right with United ... I seem to be at a loss since our flight was 'cancelled' not 'bumped.'  Second thing, hopefully this helps you understand what happens when you fly United and what you can expect if the unexpected happens.  Here goes ...

***Here's What Happened***

We boarded our flight at SFO (UA863, if you want to know) and prepared for a 15-hr nonstop flight to Sydney.  It left at 10:30PM and when we boarded and went to the back row, we discovered that our seats were still in pieces at the back of the plane due to some 'maintenance issue.'  We got them back together, settled in and waited for takeoff.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.

They kept updating us every 15 minutes that a 'maintenance issue' was delaying us but they expected to leave shortly.  I took a nap and kept my 8-year-old occupied.  They took pity on us, passed out water and let us use the lavs.  I kept telling myself that the matter would soon be resolved and we'd be on our way.

I was wrong.

After three hours - it was 1:30 at this point.   They cancelled our flight.  The 270 people on the flight, all sleepy and pissed off, filed off the plane and we started making other arrangements.  Given that the flight was on 12/19, I knew it was going to be tough to find alternate arrangements since everyone seems to go down to Sydney at that time of year.  Called the 800 number, made arrangements to get booked on another flight, only to learn that the next available flight leaves Los Angeles two days later.  That created boondoggle #1, in which we discover that Expedia's non-refundable rooms really mean non-refundable.  Now we're out over $500 for the two days we won't be there.

So we stand in line anyway for another 2 hours to see if we can get a better option - it's 3:30 by the time I finally talk to a gate agent and find out, no, no other planes are leaving ... including the one that we just left.

And we didn't leave for a really stupid reason: 

Turns out - the only thing keeping us leaving that night was the latch on the crew sleeping quarters door of the 777.  I guess it wouldn't lock right and the maintenance guy spent 3 hours farting around with it instead of replacing the door, as he announced he finally would, just in time for the captain to say ""we're not allowed to fly after that amount of time so sorry, this flight is cancelled.""

I don't know about you but I've work in maintenance operations for a living and I know that you're allowed to escalate issues to replace non-working hardware when you can't find the simple answer in a short amount of time.  Had the maintenance guy been competent, he would have spent 30 minutes troubleshooting the door, replaced it in another 60 and this thread would never have happened.

***And Then ...***

We go downstairs to get our bags back.  Turns out, someone at United decides that everyone getting a bag back needs to file a 'lost bag claim,' creating another 2 or 3 hour-long line for us to stand in.  After about half an hour, we decide ""we'll check our bags when we return for our rescheduled flight"" and go home.  I'm glad we did - some people stayed there until 10 the following morning waiting for the one guy working baggage at 3am to get their bags.  Some of them never did.

It's now 4am.  Never having used Uber before, I approach a cab driver for a lift home.  He tels me that it'll cost me $150 to get home and United has already told me that I'll be compensated for my cab trip.  Fine, whatever, let's just go home.  We pile in and he drives us 45 minutes to get back home.  It's pissing down rain and it takes him (no joke) 30 minutes to figure out how to do a manual credit card receipt transaction since his reader isn't working and he won't take a check.  I have this guy yelling in Persian at someone on the phone in my drive way at 5am on a Saturday for half an hour - surprised my neighbors didn't call the cops.

***And Then ...***

We show up early to SFO 2 days later - I carefully check with United and Delta to make sure our bags were found and ready to go down to Sydney since my wife has time-sensitive medication and she only packed so much in her carry-on.  After several trips back and forth, they assure us that yes, the bags are checked ... we should be good to go.  We jump on the Delta flight, change at LAX and then down to Sydney.

When we arrive - sure enough - there's problems.  The bag with the medicine arrived (thank God) but one of our bags, the one with all of our fancy-dress event clothing is not there.  We file a 'lost bag' claim in Sydney, go out and wait for our clothes.

Next day?  No bag

Getting desperate, we go to the CBD and buy some last-minute clothing for our event.  Between the clothes, shoes and toiletries we were missing, another $400 down the drain.  Our bag eventually shows, but too late to do anything other than say ""yeah, that's nice.""  We put the whole thing out of our mind, even though I do file a claim with United for all of the money we lost as a result of the unlatched crew sleeping quarters door.

And Now
I just got an email today from United.  They offered a '$125 voucher' as a gesture of goodwill.  I declined and requested compensation similar to what they'd offer someone who has been involuntarily bumped from a flight.  They declined, saying ""  Please understand that our industry is vulnerable to a number of challenges that can, and do, affect our operation on a daily basis. For us to absorb our passengers? incurred expenses or offer cash for compensation would not be a long-term business proposition we would ever be able to maintain.""

This is from the company that paid their CEO $8 Million last year and the last CEO $17 Million when he exited as part of the United / Continental merger.  I don't think asking for $1100 to compensate us is unreasonable, they pay as much as $1300 per bumped passenger.

**What We Lost**
I did the math:

* $130 for the cab ride home at 4am
* $526.78 in lost hotel room fees
* $45 for the Uber Ride Back (Never using SF Cabs again)
* $435.73 to replace the clothes we had to buy because our bag was lost in Los Angeles

All told - we spent $1137.51 because a United Maintenance Guy couldn't figure out how to get a crew sleeping quarters door latch to close in less than 3 hours.  United's offer of a $125 voucher' as a 'goodwill' gesture doesn't even cover the cab ride home, to say nothing of everything else we lost.

I'm happy to say that Reddit helped us enjoy our stay otherwise - the folks over at /r/sydney were top-notch as far as their recommendations go and we managed to have a great time down under ...

That is, as long as we didn't talk about United.

Suggestions?

***TL;DR - Flew on United, they cancelled our flight for a dumb reason and now we're out $1137.51***

EDIT - To clarify, I realize that many people feel that this is 'just one of those things' that United should not be held accountable for.  Let me add some information that I feel should be helpful:

* United had this 777 at the gate for several hours before boarding, I know because we were there to look at it.  Any maintenance issues with the plane had many, many hours to be handled before takeoff.  Whatever happened in terms of maintenance at 10:30 in the evening didn't have to wait for that point in time to be handled (i.e. - if my seat could be torn apart and put back together at 10:30, there's no reason it couldn't have been put back together at 3:30).  United didn't put a priority on having this plane passenger-ready for an on-time departure.

* The issue that caused our flight to be cancelled was something that could have been handled in a shorter amount of time had United focused on getting us in the air on time as planned.  Instead, the maintenance guy troubleshot the door for 3 hours before announcing that the door needed to be replaced, an activity taking, according to them '60 minutes', putting them over the amount of time they were allowed to fly.  Had United put a priority on getting passengers into the air, the maintenance crew should have been free to say ""You know, this is taking too long - let's replace the door and get these people out of here.""  I don't know the circumstances behind their decision to troubleshoot instead of replace, but when you're doing maintenance for a living and people's dollars are being lost for every minute you're troubleshooting, you're allowed to say ""do what you have to do, get these people back online.""

Are all of these things minor issues?  Yeah, sure ... but when minor issues are allowed to get in the way of the trip you've been planning for seven years, when those issues create a cascade effect of other problems that you were not budgeting for then yes, you're understandably disappointed.  You also expect the company whose decisions created the circumstance to make it right.  

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR** - booked trip thru Expedia w/ connection that's too short to realistically make. Wut do?
--

Booked a trip that goes from a major US airport to CDG before heading to BCN. I assumed (incorrectly) that I would be able to make my connecting flight with only **1 hour 15 minutes**, because in all my flying experience I've never needed more than a half hour between flights.

The internet says **I'm screwed**. We are going from terminal *2E* to *2F*, so they are close - **but**, we are going to have to go through passport control and/or customs, and with 1 hour 15 minutes, we're in a bad spot. The general consensus where this question has been asked before (it's a popular one) is - for CDG you need at *least* 2 hours.

What I've found so far is the following:

1. Some say there will be people standing by the gate when we arrive who are there specifically for ""tight"" connections? They can get us through passport control in some sort of express lane?
2. Some say just don't worry about it, they'll book you on the next available flight? It's Delta through and through (although obviously the short hop is a ""sub"" airline of Delta).
3. Could possibly try to change the booking? Since it's been booked through Expedia, what's the best route to change it? Try and go through Expedia, or through the airline itself?"

In November, I'll be motorbiking solo up Vietnam from Ho Chi Ming City to Hanoi. I've done a good bit of research myself but some things I've had trouble finding definitive or up to date info on. I'm hoping some of you will have some good advice! I'll try and keep it short and will be happy to detail/ explain my thoughts in any questions/ comments you may have!
  
  
Background:

I'm 25M from London and have some time off between quitting my last job and starting my next. I've wanted to do this trip since that Top Gear episode, so this is a great opportunity. The closest trip I've done to this was 2 weeks in Thailand a few years ago (Bankkok, Chang Mai, Phuket, Koh Tao - buses not bikes though).

In terms of budget like most backpackers I'll be staying at hostels most of the trip and generally not splurging but if there are awesome food/ places/ activities that cost a bit more I'm going to pay for them. I've also read it's really not worth the $1-2 difference arguing with a local who will occasionally try and scam you, so I'm ok with that too.

  
[Itinerary](http://imgur.com/1vNgscO) - obviously this is flexible and comments welcome about how I've crammed too much in or X place is a tourist trap and not worth doing:

(Day 1 is Monday 31st Oct)

Day 1 - 5: Ho Chi Minh City (+Mekong Delta if worthwhile?)

Day 6 - 7: Vung Tau & Mui Ne

Day 8 - 10: Dalat & Nha Tran

Day 10 overnight train from Nha Tran to Da Nang for Hoi An

Day 11 - 15: Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue

Day 16 - 17: Dong Ha, Dong Hoi 

Day 17 overnight train from Dong Hoi to Hanoi

Day 18 - 20: Sa Pa, Ha Giang (possibly overnight trains)

Day 21 - 22: Cat Ba/ Halong Bay

Day 23 - 27: Hanoi

  
Questions:

**1) Motorbike**: Instead of what bike to get or who I should get it from I'll ask it slightly differently: [A Honda Blade from Tigit Motorbike in HCMC](http://tigitmotorbikes.com/travel/honda-blade/) works out to be 234 USD for the whole trip ($1000 purchase price - $800 guaranteed buyback + $34 transport cost from Hanoi to HCMC). This price seems competitive vs craigslist, Facebook and the reviews on [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d6429729-Reviews-Tigit_Motorbikes_Guided_Day_Tours-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tigitmotorbikes/reviews) are almost all 5 stars. Why shouldn't I go for this?

**2) Overnight Train vs Motorbiking**: Reasoning behind the overnight trains is mainly there doesn't seem to be as much to see/do between Nha Trang - Hoi An and Dong Hoi - Hanoi. These are long rides (500km / 2 days' ride per segment, mostly on Highway 1) and with train I can just sleep and save time/money. What would I be missing out on?

**3) Ho Chi Minh Highway**: This is apparently *the* road to take to go up or down Vietnam, however my itinerary as it stands doesn't take advantage of this very well (other than maybe between Hue and Dong Hoi). This will be my first time in Vietnam so I feel like I should check off the main sights. Will I be missing out on too much? Also how bad is Highway 1 from your experience?

**4) Weather**: How would bad weather affect my trip, are there any deal breakers (e.g. Hoi An flooding)?

**5) Accommodation**: Is it necessary to book ahead, if so how far in advance? I'm inclined to wing it to be more flexible and from reading about *nha nghi* it seems that I should just be able to walk in?

**6) Gear/Bag**: I going to try and fit everything in a 35-40L pack and get mostly quick drying clothes. I am hoping to pack pretty lightly as I don't have any DSLRs or special gear to take. I'll probably do another post once I've acquired most of the gear I'll be taking and am ready to pack, but is there anything less obvious that I should be aware of?

**7) Currency**: I'm planning on using ATMs for most of the cash needs, I'm with HSBC, which should give me free withdrawals at theirs and Techcombank's ATMs, I'll pay FX fee but that's <3% which isn't bad. How much cash should I carry on me normally? I would think ?50 equivalent should be plenty? 

**8) Visa**: on arrival (most websites quote 25 + 20 USD) vs from embassy (Haven't been able to find cost) - I have a UK passport, happy to leave it with the embassy for a few days.

  
Thanks so much for taking the time to read and for everyone who comments! I'm going to bed now but will respond to all comments/ messages when I get up and clarify anything that may be unclear!

After that we will start our journey through Vietnam from south to north. I was thinking about doing something like Mekong Delta > HCMC > Hoi An > Hanoi > Sapa. Is that a good plan?

The day started in Atlantic City, the last overnight stay of an epic road trip covering over 2000 miles of the US east coast. We were up nice and early, as we had a train to catch from Philadelphia to NYC (our flight home was from NYC) which was due to depart at 10:35 AM. The plan was to drive to Philly, drop our car off at the rental place and then catch a taxi to the train station. All went well until the taxi. Upon arriving at the Amtrak station, I notice my phone is missing. I remember using it inside the taxi, so I try calling it, but it has been turned off. It had a full charge when I lost it, so I'm assuming someone (most likely the taxi driver) has turned it off so it can't be tracked. This is especially devastating as my phone had all my photos from the trip on it.

In the mad rush to find my phone, we miss the train to NYC. We pay again and rebook, but then we go to the wrong platform and miss the second train. We pay and rebook again.

Then on the flight from NYC to LA (that same day) we can't land in LA as crosswinds are too strong. We circle for an hour before diverting to Phoenix. We wait in Phoenix for an hour before heading to LA, where we have two aborted landings (one we actually touched the ground before taking off again) before landing safely. This delay means we miss our connecting flight to Australia, which was with a different airline so we have to rebook and pay for those tickets again. The flight isn't for another 24 hours, and the airline (Delta) refuses to pay for our accommodation.

and the gates were located on the complete opposite sides of the terminal. i had to run down the entire length of the terminal. from gate 72 to gate 7, all in 15-20 minutes. i tried to make it but apparently i was late by 2 minutes. they closed the doors a few minutes earlier and that fucked me. coupled with getting delayed a few minutes while getting off my first plane

the whole thing was bull shit to be honest. had no control over it and just got fucked due to circumstance. thankfully i was able to get on the next flight which was 4 hours later. it was either that or a flight 8 hours later which would have totally fucked up my trip

how do i avoid this mess from happening again? i think i shouldn't book flights with short lay overs anymore and give myself at least 2-3 hours. it fucking sucks but i can't handle my trips getting randomly fucked over like this

i paid $60 for preferred seats on the flight i missed too. now i'm gonna get stuck with a stupid middle seat in between 2 people for 4 hours. and then i have to spend time calling delta at the end of this to get my money back

My favorite airline is by far Lufthansa. When it comes to leg room (Im tall, so this is important to me), food quality and nice service, they take the cake in my book. 

I never liked AA or Delta. Food is okay at best and the employees don't seem very friendly.

One that surprised me was Aeroflot. I had really low expectations and they ended up being superb. On par or even exceeding American competitors.

"2016-09-29 21:54:19"|"Is WOW Air really that bad?"|"I have read the FAQ and believe this post is appropriate. If not, I apologize and please feel free to remove the post.

I'm planning a relatively inexpensive trip to Frankfurt, Germany for about 8 days sometime next year. WOW Air is *significantly* cheaper than every other airline - I've found a roundtrip flight for $300 from MIA-KEF-FRA and then FRA-KEF-MIA. 

But the reviews of WOW Air are... awful. 

A lot of them seem to be about the on-flight food/beverage costs, luggage costs, and lack of entertainment. That won't be a problem for me: I'll travel with a single carry-on, following their weight and dimension guidelines (or purchasing extra weight beforehand if necessary). I'll also bring my own food, entertainment, etc. for the flight itself. I read the fine print and I'll be prepared.

Part of me wants to play it safe and go with an airline I know, like Lufthansa, Air Berlin, or even Delta. But a $300 *roundtrip* flight from Miami to Germany? I can't find that anywhere. I'm willing to have a generally worse experience to save $500+, but the reviews - without context - are really scaring me here.

So is WOW Air really that bad? Will I have to worry about missing connecting flights due to extremely excessive delays, or having flights completely cancelled with no reimbursement? Do you have good or bad experiences you could share?"

I checked Delta, Alitalia, and other direct sites and it was like $5,000+ for two multi-city tickets.  Sites like Travelocity and Kayak have tickets closer to $2,500.

The problem is that the total package (including airfare) was just a hair over $3,200 and removing the flights dropped it to $1,900.  Are there any recommendations on where to get the airfare to keep the price around what I was looking at originally?

I'm envisioning a subreddit where these two broad types of people meet. Tripgoers give a general outline (origin and destination, budget, length of trip, dates or season, interests, etc.). Tripplanners respond and create dream itineraries with lodging, suggested sights, and transportation based on the tripgoer's parameters. The tripgoer selects the itinerary that interests them the most. 

I'm imagining a system like r/changemyview: In that subreddit, people award ""deltas"" to folks who successfully change their view. In this one, the winning tripplanner gets a ""delta"" of some kind. 

In exchange for a nicely-planned getaway, the tripgoer would post a trip review with pictures and feedback of the itinerary. That way, when the tripplanners get our chance to travel, we'll have a little bit more intel.

About 24 hours ago in Thailand, my nephew who is 4 years old was hit by a motorcycle on a family vacation.. He has been trying to work with Delta to get home with his family and children. Rather than accommodate him and his family, they are trying to price gouge my brother for a medical emergency where my nephew needs two seats in first class to keep his leg elevated to travel back to the US to see a pediatric orthopedic surgeon.

Delta has done horrible things in the past - but this is fucking unreal to me. If you can, please retweet this and share in an effort to make Delta show some compassion for this issue. Policy change is needed from within for medical emergencies. Trying to make a buck on a customer who medically needs a seat is unacceptable. My brother and I are dumbfounded over this situation and just want to get him and his family home so he can save his sons leg and his life.. 

Absolutely unreal. 6.2k apparently is Delta's assessed value of saving a child's leg and possibly their life.

> Thank you for all of your wonderful responses! I actually ended up going a completely different direction since a friend invited me to a weekend stop over in New York on my way out. I ended up going with a mix of Jet Blue, Delta (I splurged for the premium seat on the long haul) and Air France. I may regret my decision once I'm at the airport, but for now my desire to change things up has won out. It's not my last trip, so I can always learn my lesson and go back to my predictable LH flight next time. 



I am taking a trip from Houston to Naples, Italy in December... again.  
This will be my 7th time in 18 months. Typically I've flown with Lufthansa with a few other airlines mixed in occasionally (United/Canada/Brussels) Unfortunately military pay (hubby is stationed over there) doesn't allow for frequent international travel in anything nicer than economy. If you can imagine I'm feeling a bit worn with the monotonous 8-10 hour knee stiffening flights, and I'm feeling a bit tired of LH just in general.

* What I'm asking is, from your experience, for the long haul flights, (I couldn't really care less about the shorter ones) is Lufthansa economy, or United economy PLUS better? I've never taken United on a long haul so that one's new to me. I do know if it was between econo, and econo, I'd stick with Lufthansa, but is the infamous American airline worth the sacrifice for the leg room on a 9ish hour flight?

I do know that Lufthansa is implementing a new premium economy, but I can only seem to get it for the outgoing itinerary. The return will only let me book business, which unfortunately is not financially an option.

I don't travel much so I'm not as familiar as I would like to be on what is okay or not. I will be traveling Delta from Birmingham AL to Orlando FL. I'd like to just have a carry-on vs having a checked bag. I will be gone for about 4-5 days. I'm currently looking for an appropriate luggage and am considering the Samsonite Silhouette Sphere 2 Softside 19 Inch Spinner which measures 19 x 7.5 x 14.5 inches. Delta's requirements are 45 linear inches (22 x 14 x 9 in) or 115 centimeters (56 x 36 x 23 cm) including handles and wheels...do you think this Samsonite luggage would be okay?

I know the hotel I'm staying at will provide at least a hairdryer, toiletries, and ironing board. Being a woman, I'll probably pack at least my flat iron. I've considered looking for a small steamer for my clothes though as I don't think all of my clothes would be okay to be ironed so any recommendations for that would be great.

I will need to pack make up of course. I think the rule is if it's any liquids, than it must be less than 3.4 oz right? And all liquids have to be in a 1 quart/liter zip top bag?

Oh and I'm already approved for TSA pre-check. I've never actually got to use it since I've been registered for it though.

As always, any tips and suggestions will be greatly appreciated."
"2019-06-01 20:35:23"|"TPA-->ATL-->AMS-->AAL. First flight by Delta delayed, had to pay for a hotel in ATL. Compensation under EU law?"|"I'm getting strongarmed by Delta/KLM about compensation. Want to make sure I'm in the right before I give a customer service representative a hard time. 

My understanding is that the law does not apply for the TPA-->ATL portion of the flight (Delta potentially covering hotel costs, notwithstanding). 

However, the delay meant that the rest of the journey was a mess of delays, too. I missed the connection for ATL-->AMS, so I had to fly ATL-->JFK (Delta). Then I flew JFK-->AMS on KLM (delayed 20 min departing, 1 hour landing). Then I was supposed to fly AMS-->AAL, but missed the connection because of the prior delay, and rerouted AMS-->CPH instead. Then that flight was delayed 1 hour, and arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes late, causing another missed connection in CPH. The final flight didn't get me into AAL until 22:00 on May 4. My original arrival was 17:50 on May 3.

Do I have a claim that is simply being refused by KLM? Or am I just falling between the cracks of this law? I.e., cumulatively, the experience is well within the time constraints of the law, but individually each flight might not be...


EDIT: ""AMS-->AMS"" to ""ATL-->AMS""

EDIT 2019-06-29: Worked! 600 per person en route to my bank account. They would not give me anything because they kept focusing on the TPA or ATL origins. They shut down my ticket after I kept telling them that they should focus on the European section of the journey. I simply resubmitted a ticket that started with the flight from JFK (operated by KLM to an EU destination), instead, and they asked for bank details. I also had to scan and upload a letter from my partner authorizing their compensation to go to my account (I paid for both tickets), along with a scan of their passport."

We plan on bringing enough instant formula bottles to feed him at the airports and on the planes and will stop to get more when we arrive for the time there.

(Cross-posted to /r/awardtravel)"|"Both my wife and I are Platinum level on oneworld, mainly because we live near an American Airlines hub. She travels a lot for work and I try to get her to use one world whenever possible, but sometimes she will pick Southwest or Delta just because it is more convenient. That's fine. It's her life. But right now we are looking at summer vacation tickets to Europe. The one world Alliance tickets are extremely expensive at the moment. Perhaps they will drop, especially since the euro is doing poorly against the dollar, and of course the airlines are raking in record profits, but on the other hand they may not drop the prices if they can sell them for these exorbitant prices.


There are some other airlines which are a few hundred dollars cheaper to our destination, such as Icelandair and the Portuguese airline TAP. But they have some drawbacks in terms of the itinerary , and also we would be losing quite a few miles. Now the important thing about having miles for me is keeping my status, because I like having the free main cabin extra seats , as well as boarding first and all that other crap. I rarely used my miles for award tickets, although we have and it has saved us a lot of money. 

So I'm wondering whether should pay perhaps 200 or $300 more per ticket to fly with one world then with one of these non Alliance Airlines, like Delta or Swissair. Is it really worth a few hundred dollars to get those extra mile points? I'm not one of those people who are good at valuing miles per dollar and all that, so any advice you could give me would be appreciated!"

"2017-05-17 22:31:52"|"24F American planning a two week Europe trip, looking for feedback on my itinerary"|"Hello Travelers! I am planning a 2-week trip to Europe in early November. I?m American and this will be my first time in Europe (though I?ve traveled extensively in other continents). I?d love some critiques and recommendations on my draft itinerary. I will be meeting my brother who is studying abroad in London for part of his fall break. Destinations were chosen based on being iconic travel destinations, recommendations from friends, and proximity to one another. 

* Days 1-4: London (with brother)
* Days 5-7: Paris (with brother)
* Days 8-9: Amsterdam (with brother)
* Days 10-12: Copenhagen (solo)
* Days 13-16: Berlin/Frankfurt/Other? (solo)

A few things to consider:

* **Germany:** I?ve heard amazing things about Berlin and everyone I?ve asked has said it?s THE place to go in Germany. However, for some reason flights to NYC from Frankfurt are a lot cheaper and faster than from Berlin. I?m considering cutting my time in Berlin short to go to Frankfurt for a couple days and fly out from there, or maybe cutting out Berlin altogether. Or even choosing an entirely different final destination. I?d appreciate any input on this. 
* **Safety:** I?m 24F, not concerned about safety with my brother but for the solo legs I want to make sure wherever I go is safe for a woman traveling alone. From what I?ve heard this shouldn?t be an issue in major European cities. I won?t have working cell service but I?ll be able to use my phone over Wi-Fi. I can string together a few basic sentences in French, Spanish, and German.
* **Airfare:** I have 130k Delta miles and Platinum status. I?m hoping this will be enough to cover my flight to/from (based in NYC) and most of the travel between cities. I?m pretty sure I can use my status to get a free checked bag on partner airlines (main ones will be Air France and KLM). I also have AMEX points which can be transferred to British Airways. If needed I don?t mind paying out of pocket for a flight (or train if it makes sense) as long as it?s affordable and I can avoid excessive fees. Will probably use a bag sized 22x14x9 (inches) which I know may not fit European carry-on requirements. Will probably make a new post in /r/awardtravel but feel free to comment if you have any perspective on using Skymiles in Europe. 
* **Lodging:** I have 170k Marriott points and 50k SPG points. Planning to use these up on lodging. If a city doesn?t have a Marriot or SPG property or if I run out of points I?ll book AirBNB or a cheap hotel. Transferring AMEX points to Hilton rewards is also an option.
* **Budget:** Since the majority of my trip is subsidized with points I?m not very concerned about budget. I?d obviously like to avoid excessive expenses but I don?t mind splurging a bit to make the most of the trip. Would like to keep expenses below $2000 USD if possible. 
* **Interests:** With my brother we will be doing partying and drinking but also seeing the typical sights, museums, and enjoying the food. By myself I will do less crazy nightlife stuff and more walking around, taking in the sights, and maybe the occasional drink at a bar. TBH I?m pretty introverted but I?m open to making new friends to hang out with as long as I?m able to retreat back to my hotel if I want to do my own thing or if I?m getting a creepy vibe. 


I know I?m not spending a lot of time in each city. I?m really trying to cram as much into my 2 weeks as possible, but spending enough time in each city to not feel super rushed. I?m very flexible with my itinerary and willing to adjust based on recommendations, the only things set in stone are the first 4 days in London (need to meet up with my brother and visiting universities) and spending at least a day in Copenhagen (planning to meet up with an old friend). Thank you in advance for any critiques or recommendations!

My name had been randomly selected for a security check, so all my bags were searched before boarding. No issues there. Later Mo and I are sitting in our seats on the plane, and take off is in 15 minutes, when an air hostess comes to us and tells us that Mo was randomly selected for a check and he needs to get off and bring his bags with him. I smirk, amused at how 'random' this check is. Only one person, the only Arab on the flight, was ""randomly"" selected for a check - whilst already on our plane and minutes away from take off. He makes a joke asking they don't leave without him to which they say they won't. Mo goes with them, I wait in my seat.

5 minutes later the woman comes back, tells me that Mo has set off some kind of security alarm, and that we need to take our bags off. Apparently some explosive alarm set off, so we need to wait for the police and we will therefore likely miss our flight. I mention racial profiling to which she says it isn't and this is normal procedure (I don't see any other white people being taken off the flight). The police arrives, as expected find nothing, and the flight is still there but they tell us we can't get back on, and our suitcases have already been removed.
We are then put on a later flight which isn't direct and involves a connection, lands us 9 hours later than originally planned (in the process ruining all of the plans we had made for that afternoon/evening). I then ask if we are getting an upgrade or anything to which I get told no.

I am absolutely fuming about this and think this is absolutely appalling. Does anyone know if there is anything that can be done?"

* LAX-LAS
* LAS-JFK
* DFW-LAX

I've been looking at the bookings and noticed that we have the option of upgrading to Delta Comfort+ or First Class.

Is it worth spending extra money to upgrade? I'm not really worried about the LAX to LAS flight as it's so short. 

Any advice is appreciated!"

"2016-12-10 00:58:57"|"Korean Air Horror Story, credit card verification. Do I have any options?"|"Do NOT buy tickets directly from the Korean Air website for someone else. A family member used their card to purchase tickets for me, but Korean Air requires that the person flying have not only the exact same card they bought the ticket with, but also that it must be in their name. The only alternative is to have the purchaser of the ticket go to a Korean Air office and sign a form. 

The bullshit is, my local airport does not have a Korean Air office, and my first flight is with Delta to Dallas ft. Worth, which happens to be the nearest Korean air office. Their customer support people were acting like a bunch of asshats, and it seems the only option is for my family member and I to drive all the way to Dallas to get this sorted out, which is about a 6 hour drive.

They said they could refund the ticket, but the new one would have to be purchased at today's prices, if even available. I will never use Korean Air again if I can avoid it, because that policy is absolutely insane. Is there anything I can do, or will we have to just eat the gas money and time and drive all the fucking way to Dallas and back?"
"2018-06-18 12:51:24"|"Planning 15 hour Paris layover. Please help, will be first time solo travel and using a metro!"|"Hi all, I'm an American travelling to Paris in two days and I have some urgent questions that I need help sorting out please. My plan is to explore the city during my 15 hour layover. It will be my first time ever travelling alone so I don't really know the nuisances of international travel and getting through the airport. I also have some questions about the metro. I've tried to do research before posting this, but I have never been in a metro in my life so I really don't understand when people write out their explanations. 


So first, my airport questions. I will be arriving in Charles de gaulle airport at 7:30 am my flight to Istanbul leaves at 10:50 pm (at night the same day). I called Delta and first they said my luggage would be checked through to the final destination (all flights on the same itinerary), but then I asked the employee to ask a survivor and they say if the layover is more than 12 hours, I must claim my baggage. I've seen conflicting answers on Reddit. 

Does anyone know which is right? In the event that I must claim my luggage, is it safe to assume I can just use the luggage storage service near the RER station? Once I arrive in the airport, the Delta agent on the phone said I can first check in for my flight to ?stanbul and then leave the airport and explore. Is this recommended (will it save time)? Will they take my luggage in that case (probably around 8:30 am)?  Does this mean I will first have to go to terminal 1 to check in and then go the RER station in terminal 2? Or can I check in for my flight anywhere or even on my phone. If I already have all my boarding passes, do I even need to check in (isn't check in just to get the boarding pass)?


For getting to Paris, I know I take the RER b train. But then I need to switch to RER c? At which stop does this take place? So for example, if I want to visit Sacre Coeur, the RATP app is telling me to take Rer b all the way to Gare de lest Noctilien and then take a train from that station to Anvers. Is this the fastest way? But plugging in CDG to Anvers on rome2rio, it says to take RER b to Paris Nord and then walk. How do I know which is better or right? How do I plan the routes to take? 


I saw on this website that there are strikes going on, https://parisbytrain.com/paris-rer-train-strike-2018/. Should I be worried about this if my date is not planned to be a strike date? If it is, should I ditch my plans?


Does anyone have any recommendations or can provide me a link for a guide on what to see and in what order to see these things to maximize efficiency? I don't mind walking long distances. I just want to be able to see as much of Paris as possible. I saw a video by Jay Swanson covering the Eiffel tower, Louvre, Notre Dame, Arc de triomphe, Moulin Rouge, and Sacre Coeur. But most of it seemed to be using the metro and I feel I could see more if I walked most the trip. I mostly interested in seeing historical places and maybe trying some great food!


On returning to the airport, I just have to look for an RER b train because they all go to the airport, right? Since my flight leaves at 10:50, at what time should I plan to be back in the airport. 7:50? And if I need to recheck my baggage in, how early should I be back?


Thank you for all of the help in advance! Sorry for all the questions, I'm just really stressed! I've never traveled alone before and I've never used a train/metro. But I'm so excited to explore Paris!

"2017-10-07 16:12:41"|"Vietnam/Cambodia Travel Advice Needed"|"Hi everyone,

My boyfriend and I are going to Cambodia then Vietnam for a month in December, and are in need of a few travel tips. We are in our early 20s and have been to Vietnam previously. We love good food, culture, and history. We have a mid-range budget, but don't mind spending more if it is worth it. We are fit and active, but don't like doing anything too intense. 

In Cambodia, we are after advice on:

- We want to see the sunrise and sunset at Angkor Wat. Is it best to do a tour of the temples, or explore them on our own? We have 2 full days free for this.
 
- What is the best transport company to go with in Cambodia? We were thinking busses. We need to get from Siem Reap to Battambang, Battambang to Phnom Penh, and Phnom Penh to Kampot. 



For Vietnam, we are after advice on:

- Recommendations for food on foot tours in Hanoi, Hue and Ho Chi Minh
- Cooking classes in Hoi An

- Mekong Delta and Can Tho tours from Ho Chi Minn (not involving an overnight stay)

- Sapa local tour (we already have transport and accommodation, we just need someone to show us around for one day)

- We are considering a day trip from Hue to Phong Nha. It will be cold in December and we are not overly adventure people, and the tours we have found involve 4h there and back and seeing one cave, so don't seem worth it. Any advice around Phong Nha, or alternative things to do in/near Hue would be appreciated.


Thanks for all of your help in advance! 

**Edit: we are not comfortable driving motor bikes/scooters. We don't do this at home and don't want to do it in another country. "

tl;dr: **[There is no Golden Rule to Cheap Tickets](http://i.imgur.com/MmafaCJ.png?1)** from [here](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/02/travel/20-travel-mistakes/index.html). Use all these resources:

1. **Use [ITA Matrix](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/)** and compare with the rest: [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.com) and [Kayak](http://www.kayak.com) for aggregation. [Google Flights](http://www.google.com/flights/). Google owns ITA. [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com) - Redditor-made, and presented in time-bars. [Adioso](http://adioso.com/) - simple and flexible searching. [For simple one-ways or round-trips, look at Routehappy](https://www.routehappy.com/). [Momondo](http://www.momondo.com/) - another alternative.

2. See **[WikiVoyage for discount airline](http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Low-cost_airlines)** info. For example, there's [RyanAir](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xg6qc/ive_built_a_ryanair_fares_search_engine_its/), [Air Asia](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xhg2z/similar_to_the_recently_posted_ryanmonth_ryanair/)

3. Book the flights on the **official airline site** or on expedia/orbitz - whichever one is able to replicate the flights you found on ITA Matrix. If not, call your local travel agent.

4. Booking flights on two separate tickets *can* be cheaper than booking it all on one ticket - especially if you can use discount airlines. **Caution**: if your initial flights are delayed, your next flights are not protected - it will be considered missed - so **do not book tight connections on separate tickets**. See: [General guidelines for connections](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1v6zum/faq_beginners_guide_to_airports_and_flying/cepxp1f).

5. [Other tips on booking complex itineraries](
http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19co44/flight_help_global_health_research_in_wenzhou/c8myi5z). Consider [departing from a major hub](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1v6zum/faq_beginners_guide_to_airports_and_flying/cepgj3f) (and driving there) instead of your regional airport.

6. Don't know when and where to go? Use [Kayak Explore](http://www.kayak.com/explore) or the ""Everywhere"" destination in [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.com) or [Google Flights Explore](https://www.google.com/flights/explore/) to get an idea.

7. Need to book around country-based travel restrictions or country-based pricing? Try [Expedia Japan](http://www.expedia.co.jp/) for Yen pricing or [Expedia Canada](http://www.expedia.ca/) for CAD pricing. Most airlines also offer country-specific sites. More details about sales city below.

8. [Take a look at this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/19zwm1/flying_to_japan_late_july_advice_on_cheapest/c8t1pvx) which shows the progression of ticket prices from 2 weeks to 4 months prior to departure date. It's a single sample, but it's a pretty good demonstration of the 4-8 week rule. [**This study done by ARC**](https://www.arccorp.com/news/pr20120117.pdf) shows that prices starts dropping at the 3-month mark, with the cheapest tickets ranging from 3 weeks to 10 weeks in advance.

9. Start searching around 3 months in advance and monitor your flight prices **every day** until it drops to a level you're comfortable with. If the price rises, you have to commit to a maximum price you're willing to pay. This isn't a science. [An example of an experiment I conducted](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/19zwm1/flying_to_japan_late_july_advice_on_cheapest/c8t1pvx).  [Explanation of ""when to buy""](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pkl3z/can_we_get_a_few_links_into_the_sidebar/c4z0ago). And [this stackexchange post](http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2952/flight-tickets-buy-two-weeks-before-even-during-holiday-seasons) reinforces my comments.

10. Why prices differ for the same Economy Class ticket: the [general idea behind fare basis codes](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/11elam/i_just_want_to_use_my_own_airport_yvr/c6lvjhh) - the reason why round-trip flights can sometimes be cheaper than one-ways: [one-ways are usually on a more expensive fare basis](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10kayv/why_is_it_that_a_oneway_plane_ticket_costs_me/c6em9jf). /u/sataimir explains [Fare Classes](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lhn2z/nice_try_delta/cbzlr7r) ver well.

11. Student? Try your luck at [STA Travel](http://www.statravel.com/) or [Student Universe](http://studentuniverse.com)

12. [Flying last minute is vastly more expensive than planning ahead](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/wct00/another_question_about_flying/). Airlines typically close down the ""discount economy"" ticket sale window around 1-2 days before departure. Flying standby *can* result in lower costs but only if you don't care *when* you go nor *where* you go (still rare). Always plan ahead if you know you need/want to fly somewhere. [More here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g8fbi/do_airlines_sell_tickets_last_minute_for_empty/cahuelm)

13. Use some [other tricks to airline booking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_booking_ploys). **Caution**: if the airline finds out, you can be charged the fare difference or your status/award miles earned can be invalidated as it can be considered a breach of the fare rules (""contract"") that most people don't read.

14. **Extending your stay in a connecting city**: Try looking for a flight with a connection, and book a multi-city version of that itinerary, but making the layover 3 days instead of 3 hours - [More details here](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1txm6z/wanna_see_more_of_the_world_heres_a_trick_i_like/)

15. Can I buy a flight (A-B-C) and only fly the B-C leg? **NO**. [This is not allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pkl3z/can_we_get_a_few_links_into_the_sidebar/c5dwmzm).

16. Give up searching for your own flight? Try [Flight Fox](http://flightfox.com/) and pay someone to do it for you.

17. ~~If constantly checking the same airline / travel agent site - browse in incognito mode (useless) or clear your cookies after every visit.~~ [bollocks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/)


**Just for clarification** since so many people get this wrong:

* **Immigration** is the control measure that prevents/allows you from entering or leaving the country.

* **Customs** is the control measure that prevents/allows from bringing stuff into or out of the country (i.e. ""imports"" or ""exports"")

**Region Specific Sites:**

* Europe (discount): [Dohop for Intra-European Flights](http://www.dohop.com), [RyanAir](http://www.ryanair.com/en), [EasyJet](http://www.easyjet.com/en)

* East Asia: [Scoot](http://www.flyscoot.com), [Air Asia](http://www.airasia.com), [JetStar](http://www.jetstar.com)

* Australia: [Webjet](http://www.webjet.com.au/), [JetStar](http://www.jetstar.com)

* Japan (departing): A few travel agencies sell fixed-period, hidden airline tickets for a bit cheaper. Check out [HIS](http://www.his-j.com/Default.aspx) or [No. 1 Travel](http://www.no1-travel.com/). Beware, they do not include fuel surcharges and fees yet (so it does *appear* cheaper than normal)

* Hong Kong (departing): [Cathay Fanfares](http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/latest-offers/flights/fanfares/) for last minute deals - they are very good deals.

My fiance and I are both PA's and constantly work. We miraculously have the same week off in December and were looking to go to Europe. Initially we were going to do Amsterdam and Paris however my family is a little uneasy about us going to Paris with all of the riots. We have always wanted to go to switzerland and figured this would be a perfect time to go!

I have been doing a lot of research and put together this itinerary. I was hoping to get some feedback and see if we should do anything differently.

**12/12 - Land in Zurich 9am**

chriskindlimarkt, bahnhofstrasse, boat cruise on the lake

**12/13 - Zurich --> Lucerne**

\- trains every 30 minutes. 45 minute train

chapel bridge, water tower, dying lion, glacier garden, old town, museggmauer wall. lake lucerne boat ride

**12/14 - Lucerne.**

golden round trip to mt pilatus (boat from lucerne to  alpnachstad) cogwheel train up. cable car to frakmuntegg  to kriens then bus to lucerne (i found out this is closed in December so will just need to take the cable car up and down via kriens)

**12/15 - Lucerne --> Interlaken**

\- 2.5 hour train

schilthorn (train to lauterbrunnen) piz gloria rotating    restaurant

**12/16 - Grindelwald --> kleine scheidegg --> jungfrau**

Ice Palace, eismeer station

**12/17 - Grindelwald**

relax. spa day?

train to zurich at night

\*considering going to Zermatt for the day however I'm not sure if that makes sense to just go for a day

**12/18 - Flight out of Zurich 1:15pm**

&#x200B;

We have been reading that people recommend staying in Grindelwald over Interlaken and would love some input on that.

We also really want to go dog sledding! Have been struggling to find a good company in a website that we can understand.

Any tips on places to eat that aren't insanely expensive? we plan to stay at hotels that offer free breakfast to save in that way.

&#x200B;

I should also mentioned that we are young, very active and fast paced! We don't plan to ski or snowboard. Flying standby with my grandpas delta pass and will most likely get first class from the look of things right now, and therefore should sleep well the majority of the flight.

The plan is to fly into Cambodia, see Angkor Wat and the surrounding area, then make our way south to the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam before heading all the way north to Hanoi over land, ending in Ha Long Bay. I'm looking for any suggestions of places to stop/see along the way. I'm an avid birdwatcher and nature photographer so national parks are a priority. I'll be traveling with one other, and we're both looking to see as much as we can for as little money as possible.

EDIT: 
The real problem I'm having is trying to decide if I want to limit my trip to Cambodia, because it seems like there are so many wonderful things to see and do there. We will have 15-16 days total, and we were hoping to do Cambodia and Vietnam (or Laos), but I suspect this might make the trip overly difficult and unpleasant. If you were planning your first trip to SE Asia and only had a little more than two weeks, what would you do? We have already purchased our tickets into Cambodia - and we were thinking about flying out of Hanoi (or Vientiane if we go through Laos). I'll be traveling with one other who is not as into birding as I, so we would want cultural experiences as well. I'm sure we would not get bored with two weeks in Cambodia, but could we reasonably do more and not feel like we're rushing it?

EDIT 1/15/2011:
Now looks like we are axing the vietnam/laos option. There is just so much awesome stuff to do in Cambodia, and we don't want to stress about the travel. So I guess we're now looking for more suggestions of things to do in Cambodia. We will have 15 full days starting 1/22 in Siem Reap and leaving out of Phnom Pehn."

A week or so ago, tornadoes hit near Atlanta, completely snarling airline traffic. My flight to India was the next day. Understandably, Delta had to reroute my flight through United/Lufthansa. No problem, I even got upgraded on the way to Frankfort. Unfortunately, they decided to change my return tickets without notifying me, so I wasted 3 hours last night running all over Delhi airport because nobody could find the ticket that I paid for. Finally, I was able to reach my travel agent and she helped Delta figure out their screw-up. I ended up having to be escorted through the diplomatic queue in customs so I could make my flight. (Side note: don't try to hug a Indian woman to thank her. They don't like it)
Anyway, here I sit in Heathrow, waiting for my flight back to 'Murica so I take to the twitters to voice my displeasure. Hilarity ensues:
Me- thanks for almost leaving me stranded in Delhi, guys...
@Delta- sorry for the inconvenience.
Me- yeah, well you guys really should have told me you changed my ticket.
@Delta- sorry for the inconvenience. We didn't have your contact info.
Me- You're kidding, right? (Screenshot my contact info on the Delta app)
@Delta- sorry for the inconvenience.
Notice a pattern here?
Me- so what are you going to do about it?

On our connection out here, we took about 1 hr 20 min to get from our arriving gate to our departure gate since we for some reason had to go through security twice, and we have less than 1 hr 45 min to make this outbound connection, so I?m a bit concerned. I know CDG closes gates well in advance of departure. 

We?ll arrive at gate 2F at 1210 and leave on a Delta flight at 145. Anyone have any tips for making a tight connection at CDG, or potentially avoiding two security checks? We won?t have any checked bags."

I was looking up flights to Korea from USA. I live in Louisiana so there would be 1 stop regardless going to Korea. The cost from Louisiana with 1 stop would be $1404 with delta. 

I found a cheaper option however it would be on separate tickets. I?m a member of TSA prechecked so I use it for domestic flights. I was wondering if this would be a good idea since it is on separate ticket. there is a nonstop flight to Seoul from Los Angeles for 800 at 5:50PM. Southwest airline has a flight arriving in Los Angeles for 9AM. That would give me 8 hours to make the connection. The flight going home is also the same. Would it be a good idea to book the ticket like this? The cost would only be $1000 after all flights are booked instead of $1404. What do you guys think about the separate ticket for this travel?"

Trying to get opinions on my itinerary and/or suggestions on places to eat and/or drink, additional things to do inside and outside of Paris.  We arrive Nov. 4 - Nov. 12.  Seven full days, two half days.  Yes, I know I bought plane tickets way early, but I think I got a good deal regardless.

I've been to Paris once about 8 years ago, was there for a month on a study abroad program.  This will be my husband's first time in France.  We've both been to other parts of Europe.  We like art, history, music, food, photography, wine/alcohol, unique experiences...  Not big on shopping, clubbing, or anything like that.  (We do enjoy grabbing drinks in the evening in more relaxed settings.) 

**INFO**

We aren't big breakfast people, so we will grab something from the grocery store or pastry shop.  Lunch will likely be whatever street stall we find or picnic lunch from the grocery store.  Dinner will be sit down restaurants most, if not every, night(s).  I'm thinking that $1000 USD will be enough for the food budget for two people. This will give us about $10 USD (8 Euro) each for breakfast, same for lunch, and up to $40 USD (33 Euro) each for dinner.  I'm aware that we may go over the food budget by a $100 or so and that's fine.  I'd like to aim low to start.  Though I think $500 per person is doable without giving up much for us.  I know we'll end up buying a bottle of water here and there or an afternoon treat (lookin at you Berthillon!).

Since I mentioned food... any restaurant recommendations in the Bastille area would be appreciated. Nov 2 is our anniversary so we would like to celebrate a belated anniversary in Paris with a nice meal... nothing crazy expensive... and doesn't necessarily have to be in this neighborhood, but that's where we plan to stay and I know there are many good restaurants there.

We will likely do the museum pass (4 day) at 62 euro each ($76 USD) mostly because of the skip the ticket line feature... and, of course, the potential for it to save a few dollars if we are able to make it to all the sites we want to see.

I'm thinking that the weekly Navigo pass is probably the best way to go for 22,80 euro pp (plus 5 euro for the card) and then the train to/from CDG for 9,50 euro pp.  So we'll spend 37,30 euro ($45 USD) per person on transportation.  The start/end days for the weekly pass aren't perfect, but I doubt we will really use the metro much during our first and last partial days in the city.

**BUDGET**

Airfare: $1370

Accomodations: $800

Food:  $1000

Museum Passes:  $152

Other Attractions:  $50

Transportation:  $90

Souvenirs:  $50

TOTAL:  $3,512 USD

I'll consider this our minimum budget.  Add another couple hundred dollars if we end up taking a class or a day trip outside the city.  I did leave out the cost of the meal for our anniversary for now.  Anything else I am forgetting?  Aiming to keep everything under $4,000 USD though I am aware that the euro to dollar exchange rate change before our trip.

**BASIC SCHEDULE**

**Arrive Sunday, Nov. 4 @ 1:30pm.** (*note below)

* Attempt to get museum and metro passes before leaving airport.

* Take RER or something to where we will stay.

* Snack/shower/rest.

* Wander around a bit, scout out things like closest grocery store.

* Possible dinner at L'Alberge du Louver.  I picked this place because I have been to it and the food seemed good for the price.  (Just skimmed Trip Adviser reviews and it appears they still have a prefix menu for around 19 Euro which fits into my approx dinner budget)  I also think it's good to have dinner picked out for the first night... avoids some hangry arguments on a public bench.  Open to other suggestions.

* After dinner we can walk over to the river to get a view of the Eiffel Tower lit up at night.

**Monday, Nov. 5**

* Start museum passes at Louvre. Any tips for navigating this place would be greatly appreciated.  I never did find the Dutch painters last time I was there.

* Attempt to leave around lunch time, make our way over to Eiffel Tower, have a picnic lunch. No desire to go to the top.

* Use passes to go up Arc de Triomphe.

* Musee Rodin or Musee de l'Orangerie (short visit, mainly interested in Monet).

**Tuesday, Nov. 6**

* Catacombs.

* Maybe Musee de Cluny?  Then the Pantheon since it's in the area.

* Musee du quai Branly???

**Wednesday, Nov. 7**

* Use passes at Sainte Chapelle.  Go early, avoid excessive lines.

* Notre Dame.  Consider going up the towers with museum passes depending on lines.

* Pompidou Centre... might do this before Notre Dame.

**Thursday, Nov. 8**

* Sacre Coeur, look around inside and maybe climb to the top.

* Wander Montmartre and have lunch.  Picnic lunch outside the Basilica?

* Back to the Louvre for a chunk of the afternoon.

* If there is time, and we haven't done it already, check out the Pantheon or Musee de l'Orangerie

**Friday, Nov. 9**

* Not opposed to taking a trip outside the city on any of these last 3 days, just a little overwhelmed with options right now.  I know there is Versailles, for some reason I'm not super interested... though I could be convinced.  Chartres is a possibility.  We were supposed to go last time as a class but decided not to since they had just started the restoration of all the stained glass in the cathedral.  I assume they are finished with that by now.  Omaha Beach or Mont Saint Michel also seem interesting, but I don't know if one of those is too much to squeeze into a day trip.
Any suggestions welcome.

* We could also just spend the day getting lost, lazily taking in the atmosphere of the city?  Or do some sort of guided tour or class?

**Saturday, Nov. 10**

* There's a popup flea market type thing in the 14th that I'd like to hit early.

* Maybe Palais de Tokyo (it's easy to get burnt out seeing too much historic stuff).

* Catch up on missed sites/activities from earlier in the week.

**Sunday, Nov. 11**

* Pick something to do from Atlas Obscura?

**Monday, Nov. 12 depart CDG @ 3:20pm.**

* We will have the morning to either sleep in, then relax with a long breakfast at a cafe... or cram in one more ""must see"" item on our list.

* Off to the airport around noon, I'm sure.



*So Delta canceled one of our flights... had to reschedule and we will now be arriving at 6am on Nov 4.  Suggestions on how to handle arriving that early?

Still undecided on whether we will get a hotel or AirBnB.  I feel like hotels are more likely to be willing to hold your luggage until check in, so that may end up being a deciding factor here."

I could really use some help planning a trip through Vietnam. I'm in the very early planning stage, so currently trying to work out time frame and where to go. Trip would likely be in the April/May time of year.

So basically my girlfriend and I (Canadian citizens) are looking to do a trip from the north to the south (or vice versa) by train. Would likely be starting in Hanoi and making our way down to HCMC/Mekong Delta kinda area. We were aiming for around 3 (maybe 4?) weeks but I'm not sure if that's realistic or not, any insight is greatly appreciated. Budget would be around 3-4k CAD, but hoping to spend less than that.

I've only just started researching, so I think/know that I'd like to hit Ha Long Bay, Hoi An, Nha Trang, Hue, and HCMC but I don't know too much else. What are some other towns/scenery spots worth working into the trip? I know very little so any advice from people who have done this trip before would be unreal. 

In terms of the type of destination, we're looking for interesting culture, good cheap food, half-decent hostels, and some killer scenery. Less touristy/off the beaten path is ideal. 

Thanks so much! Sorry for the vague questions I'm just honestly kinda bewildered at where to start with such a huge rich country.

Me and her would really appreciate it if someone here could create a step-by-step guide on what she has to do.

Here is a bit of background information which should help:

- She is a US passport holder and has travel insurance for her trip.

- She is flying with Delta Airlines in her domestic flights but her flight to the UK is operated by Virgin Atlantic (We booked it all using delta.com though so it's a partnership thing I think).

- She is going from Charleston, WV to Atlanta, GA for a 2 hour layover. Then, she will be going onto London

- We plan to do the Online check in 24 hours before her flight departs so we can select her seats.

* Dates Oct-13 to Oct-25


**Spain: Oct-13 to Oct-19** (Delta)

1. Arrive in Madrid -(Oct-14 8:00 am)
1. Train (raileurope): Granada Oct-14 to Oct-16
1. Drive to: Ronda Oct-16 to Oct-17
1. Drive to: Seville Oct-17 to Oct-19
1. Depart

1. 	Arrive in Marrakesh (5:30pm)
1. 	Marrakesh: Oct-19 to Oct-21
1. 	Desert Trip: Oct-21 to Oct-23
1. 	Marrakesh/Essaouira Oct-23/24 
1. 	Casablanca Oct-24 to Oct-25
1. 	Return: Oct-25 (7:40am)


What we are looking to get out of this trip is: Good food, new cultural experiences, some sensory sensations, relaxation, and maybe a bit of adventure.

We are usually pretty frugal, but since this is a honeymoon we have no problems splurging on things that are worth it (desert trip, 4/5 star hotels, riads, etc...)


I would love some feedback on the itinerary, the best modes of transportation, what cities to include/skip, etc.....

      - Tour of Chu Chi tunnels, Mekong delta river cruise. 

[Flight from HCMC to Nha Trang - ?16]

[Fly from Nha Trang to Da Nang then taxi to Hoi An]

* **Hoi An** - 3 days 
      - My Son ruins
      - Beaches

[Train, or hire taxi with driver with idea to stop at the My Son ruins en route]

* **Hue** - 3 days 

*  **Hanoi** 
     - Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre

Fly to Bangkok and then back to London

I've never traveled anywhere via plane, nor I have I gone on a trip alone. So, doing both the for the first time, at the same time, is a little more than intimidating.  
I have checked out the ITA matrix and I probably know where I'll be buying my ticket from there.  
I just saw that there is now a link to the beginners guide to airports, and I will be checking that soon. (It wasn't a link when I checked it a few weeks ago.)  
  
SO! My main question is:  
Are there any airlines I should avoid?  
I know that [United breaks guitars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo). Is there any airlines that I should avoid? Will United's guitar care quality effect my luggage?  
My choices for airlines are Delta, Jetblue, United, Alaskan, and possibly Virgin America and American airlines. (The last two are a little pricey however.) Any of those airlines I should avoid at all cost?  
  
Also, I'll be spending a few extra bucks to have a nonstop flight. Is that a smart idea so I don't have extra stuff to deal with my first time flying?  
  
Any other tips that the beginners guide may not tell me?  
  
Any scams I should avoid? ie. ""buy food before, airline food is bad/expensive.""

We aren?t very rich but we are not very poor so buying a ticket normally isn?t easy it takes a lot of working and planning.

My cousin works with Delta airlines and she said I could get a boarding pass and something with standby travel. I pay $500 and I wait for the plane to fill and they fill the seats. I feel bad for trying to ask her about it because she isn?t really nice and I cannot find information about it. I plan on traveling in 4 months the day after my graduation.

"2014-07-14 06:47:09"|"Getting cold feet a few days before my first solo travel adventure, should I go or delay my trip?"|"I'm a 21 year old on a budget who has booked a trip to Denmark, mostly around Copenhagen, for 2 weeks to stay with an exchange student friend of mine and a couchsurfing host. 

Unfortunately, being busy with a recent long term breakup, school, and work has let me neglect actually planning the trip. I have no potential itinerary or idea of things to do other than just go. I worry I'll be a burden on my hosts as I seek out their advice continually for things to do.


My options are:

A) Go ahead & wing it, probably spending more than I'd like by booking tours/trains late 

B) Bite a $150 ""change fee"" from Delta, get back the rest of my ticket money in credit to spend through them within the next year with the chance to scope out a better trip, maybe focused around a music festival or something.


I'll still have 2 weeks off work regardless, and right now I am in a very spiritual finding myself again phase after getting out of a live in relationship of 3 years, so I would still spend my time travelling locally. I will be quitting my job and moving within the next year so I will have good opportunities to travel again if I take the cancelation route.

Would you more experienced travelers recommend I plan out a trip further down the line or go ahead with it?


edit: as a side note, the things I love in travel are experiencing new cultures, nature, exploration, and good natured parties (no raves/orgies). Would even saving this ticket money for somewhere else be better?

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for your overwhelming support, you caught me in a bit of a panic. Seeing every response so positive that I should go has made me more sure and confident than ever to take this trip, despite my lack of itinerary. I'll be sure to put up some pics on here when I get back! Thank you for the inspiration, I really needed it. What a fantastic community. "

I'm getting a little confused as to which passport to show and when. And would it be okay to use the US passport number for the booking information?

The aircraft is listed as an Airbus 330-300, and all I can find via internet research is photos and reviews of the Airbus 330-200. The flight is through Delta Airlines. I just wanted to see if anyone has experience on this aircraft or one similar, or has any tips about bad seat choices and such. 

The round trip price per person is $648 which I think is low, but if it isn't I would love to know. I'm not a frequent flier so I don't have much knowledge on all of this! 

As far as Paris itself goes, are there any unsafe/bad areas that I should know about? I'm thinking of booking an air bnb in the area Pantin, is that a good or a bad idea? It's cheaper than Paris proper from what I can tell. Are hotels the best way to go? 

Thank you."
"2018-06-23 22:45:01"|"Air Canada Rouge VS Delta? Are they comparable for international flights?"|"Hey r/travel!

I'm currently booking a trip to Peru for my mother and myself. I live near Detroit, Michigan so I can book out of either Detroit (DTW) or I can take the four hour drive into Toronto (YYZ) to fly out of there if the cost is right.

I left out of Toronto for my last trip to Europe with Air Canada and the flight was great and I saved around $800. So, after seeing that I would be saving around $1,000 leaving out of Toronto this time I went ahead and booked that flight with Air Canada. I didn't realize until I was almost finished with checkout that there's a difference between Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge.

Seeing that I have 24 hours to refund my booking I went ahead and finished the purchase but now looking at reviews I'm getting really worried about the Air Canada Rouge flight (which is 8 hours). It looks like every single review recommend upgrading to premium seats which aren't great but better, the upgrade would be about $400 additional for myself and my mom.

My alternative option would be to book with Delta from Detroit for the extra $1,000 dollars. I should have enough Delta Skymiles points to pay for this flight (it would be all of my points, about 150,000 points) but I'm still spending about $600 extra in my miles to fly with Delta instead of Rouge. I wouldn't make this choice but flying with my older mom, I'm very worried she'll be miserable on the Rouge flight.

So I guess my question is how does Air Canada Rouge and Delta compare? I'm only really concerned with seat comfort. We can bring our own food and in flight entertainment. Any advice is appreciated! I have very little experience with international flights so I'm just not sure which would be better."
"2014-01-12 19:21:19"|"Frequent Travelers: What are your credit cards for miles and using internationally?"|"In researching past top posts on /r/travel and current card options, many companies have changed their products within the last year. I'm refreshing the topic for new opinions and recommendations while providing a summary of 3 best options I found based on points/miles and travel perks vs cost of the card. 

**Assumptions:** /r/travel is on a tight budget,  will pay the monthly bill, use the card for day to day transactions while traveling, wants flexibility in getting and using miles or points, may use the credit card for supplemental insurance or emergency assistance.

**Credit Cards for Points and Traveling**
 
* [*Chase Sapphire Preferred*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=chase+sapphire+prefered)  - 1:1 points transfer to participating frequent flyer programs. 40,000 points if you spend $3,000 in the first 3 months. Double points on travel and dining, an additional point per dollar for hotels and airline bookings through their Ultimate Rewards Program. 5,000 points for an additional user. NO travel insurance/assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 annual fee, waived for the first year. 15.99% APR, 0% first year.

* [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) - 40,000 bonus miles if you spend $1,000 in the first 90 days. Double miles on all purchases. $200,000 travel accident insurance. Trip cancellation/interruption coverage. Emergency Assistance.

     No foreign Transaction fees. $89 Annual fee, waived the first year. 14.99% or 18.99% based on credit, 0% for first year.

* [*United/Chase MileagePlus Explorer*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Chase+MileagePlus+Explorer) - 30,000 miles if you spend $1,000 on the first 3 months. 5,000 miles for an additional user. Double miles on United flights.  10,000 miles per calender year if you spend more than $25,000.  NO Travel insurance or assistance.

     No foreign transaction fees. $95 transaction fee, waived first year. 15.24% APR, NOT waived for first year.

**Other card considerations:** Other carrier specific cards (ie [Citi AAdvantage](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Citi+AAdvantage), [American Express/Delta SkyMiles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Delta+SkyMiles)) do not offer as much flexibility as other cards and have been disregarded. [American Express Platinum](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=American+Express+Platinum) has reduced their benefits and rewards over the last year without reducing the $450 annual fee. 

**tl;dr** I researched credit cards to be used for travel and found the [*Barclay Arrival World Mastercard*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Barclay+Arrival+World+Mastercard) to be the best current option. What have been your experiences and what are your recommendations?

**Edit:** Someone pointed out these look like referral links so I changed the links to use ""Let me Google that for you"" instead.

We are either flying out of NYC or ATL, so luckily there are ample destinations we could travel to. The catch is that our tickets have to be used by Dec 31st, meaning we must return on 12/31. We will be traveling from 12/13 - 12/31.

We have narrowed it down to either South Africa (flying into Jo'burg) or Japan (flying into Tokyo). We plan on backpacking either country, and have a budget of about $3500 USD. We are 22f and 23m respectively, and as such do not mind traveling on a budget. 

We're relatively active (as active as full-time university students can be) and are very social. Some things that interest us are: mountains, city nightlife, socializing with locals, and FOOD. 

This all being said, I'm looking for feedback on which country would be better to go to during these dates. 

For South Africa we'd fly to Jo'burg and would head to Cape Town to do the Garden Route and the Drakensburg mountains. Would love to splurge on a day at a game reserve as well. And the wineries!

For Japan we would fly into Tokyo, spend a few days there before heading out to visit cities like Kyoto, Osaka, Hakone, Shikoku (none of these are set in stone, just some destinations which sounded intriguing).

Questions:

1) Will Japan be horribly cold in the winter time? Are the Japanese still as social and active in the cold winter months (i.e. will there be things to do?)

2) Does anyone have any experience renting a car in South Africa? If so, how much did it run you and for how long did you rent it? Was driving in South Africa difficult?

3) My SO and I are interracial (native-american/black & white). Will we face discrimination in either country? (I understand that we run the risk of facing prejudice anywhere we go, but am wondering if either country is particularly unreceptive towards black/white couples)

4) How is the availability of convenience shopping for food in Japan? Will we be able to purchase items such as eggs, bacon, etc. easily?


Looking for any insight into either location for such an extended period of time in December! Thank you r/travel!

Flying to Amsterdam from Orlando on July 6th and then returning from Frankfurt to Orlando on July 16th.

I've narrowed the flight options down to the following:

Delta in Premium Economy - Direct MCO-AMS 9hrs then FRA-DTW-MCO, total of 13.5hrs for $2,160/person

or

Lufthansa standard Economy MCO-FRA-AMS 12 hrs total, then direct FRA-MCO 10 hrs for $1928/person

I'm conflicted because I like the idea of premium economy on Delta, but also feel like I'd prefer to have the direct flight after vacation as opposed to before..

I've never flown Lufthansa at all and have not flown Delta on a long haul, so I've got very little to go on for what will be the best experience and most comfortable.. Mostly trying to think about my wife and having her have the best flight possible. I'm an aviation geek (am a private pilot) so I'm happy to just be flying.. but want to make the decision that will leave her most comfortable.

"2014-04-24 01:13:50"|"Would any of you experience travelers look over my credit/debit card strategy and let me know what you think?"|"From what I've read here, it's a good idea when traveling for many months to take at least TWO debit cards linked to two different accounts and not keep all your money in one account.  The theory is that if one account becomes compromised, you won't lose all your money and you'll still have funds to eat, sleep and buy a ticket back if needed.



So, here's my approach.  Please let me know if this is a good plan. Note: I already have one Schwab account and will open a second one.  If you don't know, the Schwab account is great for travelers because all ATM fees are refunded at the end of the month.

The plan:

I will take the following cards:

* Schwab debit/atm card, linked to account #1

* Schwab debit/atm card, linked to account #2

* Delta Skymiles Amex


Card 1 will be the one I use all the time to withdraw cash at ATMs.  When the account balance gets low, I will transfer funds from the secondary account.  I will only use the card linked to the secondary account if I lose the first card.


The credit card will only serve as a backup to be used in emergencies.



Am I overthinking this?

The LATAM reps in Cusco said that I should come back to the airport tomorrow at 6am and my bags should be there if Delta transferred my bag. 

What do people recommend in this case? I have spent over an hour on the phone trying to get through with Delta, but no such luck. Should I just show up tomorrow morning at the airport and hope that the bag makes its way through? Kind of at a loss because I head into the mountains tomorrow afternoon and it will be increasingly harder to get my bag if it is not there tomorrow morning. Thoughts? Thanks in advance. 

Edit: Just received an email from a Delta Rep in Lima asking for the LATAM claim number. Without it, he claims that they can't send the bags to Cusco. So, it does look like I need to do one more step. "

Four days into a 16 day trip to Europe (from the US West Coast), my wife?s mother passed away. 
- Delta got us on an Air France code share flight to Boston, for minimal fare increase and waived the change fees, without a death certificate. 
- Airbnb fully refunded the unused, non-refundable expenses from our anticipated stay in Switzerland (with a death certificate) and followed up a few weeks later with an impressive basket of Lindt Chocolates and a nice letter to go with it. 

The letter:

**Full version:**
We had our end of summer trip planned and set to go back in April. We were traveling from the SF Bay Area to Germany, followed by Austria, Switzerland and France before heading back to Deutschland, to fly home. Original air travel was on Delta, round trip. We had Airbnb reservations set for Austria and Switzerland and had decided to figure out France (also via Airbnb), once we arrived in Europe and determined what areas of France we wanted to travel to. We were leaning towards Lyon and Strasbourg.

Our first morning in Salzburg, we received word that my wife?s mother passed away. We then went into get back to the US mode and contacted Delta to figure out how to get to the US East Coast. The agent was quite helpful and ultimately set us up on a flight, from Germany, to Boston via Paris on Air France. The fair increase was about $200pp USD, which I considered nominal, given the short notice and the day we needed to fly.  

I then contacted our host for the Airbnb reservation in Switzerland, just outside of Lucerne, and informed him of the circumstance and I would need to cancel. The cancelation policy was 5 days prior and this happened two days before the reservation. I expected the financial hit and left it at that. 

Once in Boston, as the fog of the situation started to settle, I started looking into the amount of funds I was going to lose via the Airbnb reservation and cancellation policy and came across a clause about Extenuating Circumstances. Contacted Airbnb and received a reply a couple days later, with a request for the death certificate. Sent that in one evening and before we awoke the next morning, I had a message indicating they refunded the full amount. Albeit somewhat surprised, I thought this was a good thing and they were customer oriented. 

But then the unexpected ? Fast forward about three weeks later. This past Friday evening, after arriving home from work, I had a UPS box on the doorstep, which contained the basket of chocolates from Airbnb. This was a really nice gesture and my wife was especially touched. I work for a mid-sized, employee owned management consulting firm and we have a vested interest in paying attention to the value we deliver to our clients and the level of customer service we provide. We believe it makes a difference. 

Delta and Airbnb made a difference for us in this situation and honestly, it?s a good feeling. Little gestures can go a long way some times and I thought it was worth sharing this particular one. Thanks for reading!"

Now I got an email, that at the 22nd of January 2016, they will expire if I don't do anything with them. My question is now, what the smartest way is to prevent them from expiring. My two options I currently see:

1. Donate 1000 miles to one of their partners, this counts as activity and extends the expiration deadline by 18 months after donating. That means, I'd donate beginning of 2016, *before* my miles expire and they'd be fine till summer 2017

2. Buy 1000 miles for $30, which would bump me above 50k miles overall, and therefore I'd be AAdvantage Platinum / oneworld Sapphire. If this is right, I'd benefit on my next flight from: 25% -> 100% bonus miles, 24h -> 72h upgrade confirmation, 1 -> 2 bag fees waived, priority baggage, limited -> free access to Main Cabin Extra seating, earlier boarding right after business/first class). Am I thinking this through properly? That would be totally worth $30. 

Another question: If I buy my SOs tickets with mine so that we're on the same reservation, would she benefit from some of that stuff as well? Or would she have to check-in in another lane than me, can't board earlier and couldn't make use of the speed security lane? And what about the 2nd bag fees waived? Only me or are they generous because she's on my reservation and flying with me? How does that work in general? How would the miles be accounted for. If we fly together, would I get the miles x1 or x2 when we fly on the same plane? 

Last question: In St. Louis, AAdvantage has fast security lanes. My next flight there will be both way via Delta. Will I be able to use the lanes, if I show my AAdvantage Gold card? Or will they check the tickets, too, and the benefit will only work if I fly with AA / oneworld?

I am planning on motorbiking (solo) across Vietnam in March. I have never motorbiked but I plan to take lessons beforehand so I'm not totally out of the blue, as well as avoiding cities. Since it won't be for almost a year I have time to get ready. I know a lot of people don't get a license but from what I've seen getting an international driving permit is cheap and I'd rather pay for that than potentially getting into an accident and being in jail. Plus, with a license I can get insurance, for me it's worth it instead of taking the risk.

Anyway, my planned itinerary. Hopefully this isn't too ambitious.

The top 4 spots I have chosen are Iceland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Thailand; in that respective order. 

I was planning on going between August 10-20 as this will be around the time school starts up and when I?ll be off from work. These dates aren?t very flexible. 

I checked United, Delta, and Google flights, mainly focusing on google and saw Iceland ~$400 - 500 while the others exceeding that with I believe New Zealand being the most expensive at ~$1300 - 1500.

I have talked to some people about going (roughly 5) but I am not worried about going alone. It?s been well over a decade since I?ve left my state let alone the country and do not want to wait on anyone. I have looked and know for example r/visiticeland has people you can partner up with to split costs, but will look deeper into that in the later months. 


Some questions that I had were, will $2000 be enough? Of course for the larger priced tickets no, but I was wondering say for example, Iceland if I choose to go there will that be enough to be comfortable? If I did go with a group or alone I would try and split a car rental + gas and also live in a hostel for the time being. 

If it?s not, would December be a better time? I would have my winter break and would need to do more research on this but for now I?m planning on the August dates. 

Lastly, if you wouldn?t go to any of these places, what would you recommend?

How the airline industry works."|"**Before you read the post, keep in mind that may not be relevant for someone who travels a few times during the year domestically within the United States to see family or for work. On the other hand the article was based and targeting international travelers. This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing.**


Back in the 80s and 90s shopping for air tickets was so much simpler. The airlines used to offer 3 fares. One for economy, one for business and one for first (for the airlines that offered it.) Everyone traveling economy for example would pay the same. (so no one was upset for paying more than the person next to them or some cousin who was bragging that paid less?) The reason about this was that when the tickets were ?paper? and were physical items most agencies would pre-purchase and then set a price of how much they wanted to sell for the traveling season. (which also leaded to black market too in some cases. Having strong ethnic agencies that used to monopolize their markets, buying huge amounts of ticket stock and selling it to higher prices with huge margin of profit since they could do that. They could buy lots of ticket stock, make reservations and be able to hold them for weeks (can?t do this now), or book fake names to hold the space in flights and then change the name to whoever was traveling since there was so easy and without fees to change the names of the travelers.


What changed?


The airlines hated the fact of scheduling flights that could cost thousands of dollars without knowing if the flights will be full and sometimes sending half empty planes. They removed the paper tickets and changed the game. They introduced the ?classes of service?! If let?s say on a flight there are 300 seats, and the cabins are broken down to 30 business class tickets, 70 premium economy and 200 economy tickets, each cabin is broken down to classes of service. Economy for example, those 200 seats are divided to a dozen of different economy fares that change every 9 tickets are sold. Example 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F 9G. The first 9 people will call they will buy at the price of the A class that may be $800, next 9 travelers will pay the higher tier economy, B which may be $900 etc. The highest economy may be at $1800-2000 and this is the same cabin and the same seats that someone paid probably $800 or less. The way this system works, benefits the airlines since the travelers must rush and try to buy way ahead of time to make sure they ll get the lowest economy class of service or else they will end up paying way more. The travelers cant wait till last moment anymore when there was only one economy fare out there. So it is a game between all of us the travelers. Whoever calls first and the earliest gets the good fares. On top of that, when you make get a reservation now days, you cant hold it for more than 1-2 days. (before the agents could hold them for weeks). Not to mention the penalties. Most tickets are non refundable (with an exception of death). All tickets have penalties when you try to change them and the list going on. Keep in mind in domestic and international tickets, the lowest ones (lowest classes of service) come with some harsh rules behind them. Such as you don?t get miles or you can accumulate a very low amount of them. You are not allowed to travel with a luggage (unless you pay extra at the airport). Usually those tickets are non refundable and non changeable. (If you must change something, then you lose the ticket and you have to buy new one). Not to mention you can pre-select your seating assignment. 


When buying tickets be very careful. For domestic traveling always go directly to the airlines. They keep that portion of market for themselves. Which means, you aren?t going to get a better deal anywhere else. For international traveling though, all the airlines are giving a big portion of their deals and discounted fares to consolidators and wholesalers that they provide smaller agencies and websites with airfares. So when it comes to international traveling, then you may get a lower fare from an A Airline via an agency or a website than the airline itself. (Because the A Airline may have an agreement with the B travel agency to give them the right and sell their discounted deals). Many are complaining about the fares and fees. Well traveling is not a cheap ?sport? any more. As about the competition, well, someone may say ?but there are so many airlines?. True, but most of these airlines have merged into bigger alliances. The world?s major carriers have merged into 3-4 big groups that they expanded their ?city service networks? and share price and policies. So instead for 20-30 airlines, they are basically 3. So for us the consumers, we get the one or the two of them from each city. (this mean we get 1 or 2 fares to pick from) The one or the other airline alliance. (some major cities are luckier because they may get all 3 alliances plus some other ethnic carriers that don?t belong to any of the big groups and they are just offering an extra choice of airfare. 


Seating Assignment has become a joke too now days. It used to be free, yet the past years the airlines discovered this idea to sell the seating pre-assignment. You buy your tickets on April to travel in June and you want to assign the seats. You have to pay a fee. (Makes me wonder what we will pay next). Luckily you can go get the free seat assignment at the airport the day of your departure.
Travel insurance. Often I get asked about it. Another way for the agencies to make profit. Most airlines and the trip insurances waive and forgive penalties if you are very sick. But only if you are sick. Neither the airlines nor the travel insurance will cover you for any other reason. (yet many don?t realize this and buy insurance anyways). Some major airlines will cover you and waive the fees if you are really sick, so no reason to buy any insurance. Unless of course you booked with one of the few carriers that do not accept medical reasons for cancellations or changes. Then it is worth it. Although most of the times it is a waste of money. You end up paying way too much and sometimes it is not needed if the airline covers you for medical reasons anyways. 
Nothing is guaranteed either. Penalties, fares, fees, all are subject to change. Even your paid seating assignment. Basically the airlines under their guidelines can do anything they want and you can?t do a thing about it. 


When you try to book keep in mind to search for at least 4-5 months in advance from the month you want to travel. (this is for international tickets, not domestic tickets within the U.S.) The airlines have introduced this term called ?advance purchase? which it works to discourage travelers and overcharges them if they try to call within a week or two from their desired departure date to buy tickets. If let?s say an economy ticket cost $1000 (if you book it a month or more in advance). If you try to buy the same ticket within three or four weeks, or like sometimes people do, within one or two weeks the price skyrockets. That same ticket ends up costing $2000-$3000. So try avoiding booking within a week or two and last minute tickets. It was a time that worked well for deals, but not anymore. 


So what about the Special Sales?


Prices go down once in a while too, as sales/demand mandates. The airlines monitor their flights and once the sales drop, in order for the to fill the flights they release ""special sales"" to fill up the flights. Remember the goal is to send the aircraft full.


These hints and tips are applying mainly to the big carriers. (such as Delta, United, American, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, etc). Low cost carriers such as Spirit, Southwest, Ryan Air etc that sell tickets directly from their websites and not through any of the official reservation platforms around the globe, they are a different story and most of the above information isn't applying for them.


I am sure there are certain exceptions to all the above but this is how the airline industry works now days, the majority of the times. Hope it helps. Good ticket hunting."

Going to be 40 this year, and have been dreaming about this trip for over 20 years. Finally applied for my passport, and we have flats picked out in London and Paris. We know what we want to do, so no, AutoModerator, we aren't looking for advice for London or Paris.

My hangup is the flight.

I haven't flown much in my life, less than ten total flights. I have a bit of a height issue (I wouldn't call it fear), and I don't like not being in control. The safety record is well known to me, but still it persists. There's two areas that I could use some advice/feedback on.

**Comfort:** It takes a perfect scenario for me to get to sleep. I am a stomach sleeper, as much as I've tried to change that. I doubt I will be getting much sleep sitting up in a cramped seat, but I am trying out ANC headphones, pillows, etc now to see what might assist. I am of average height, so legroom isn't a huge deal. I'm not thin, but I also don't come close to overflowing  the confines of my seat. The more I can't fall asleep, the more anxious I get about falling asleep and it cascades. All the flights from Atlanta to London are overnight, which works for our itinerary, but I'm worried I will be a mess trying to function even until dinner time. The only other overnight flight I've taken was from SFO-ATL, and I slept perhaps thirty minutes. It wasn't very fun.

**Cost:**The above dovetails into price. I can find RT tix ATL-LHR for about $650 ($1300 for both of us) in lowest level economy via a third party off Skyscanner. Now, I've seen plenty of advice that says to book with the airline, but that bumps it up to $890pp. I could then upgrade off that if I care to. Premium Economy is running roughly double my original $650pp ticket. Is some more legroom worth double? Is being able to select your seat worth $110? We're hoping to travel light, just a carry on bag for us each.

I just have no frame of reference to know if the $650pp deal is good, to not buy third party, and if it's worth double to change from Economy Basic to Premium Economy (the carrier I am basing all this off of is BA, but it seems to be the same for Delta, et al). Since we've never really traveled, we have no loyalty, points, or anything other than currency to use. We hope this is the beginning of the second half of our lives traveling more, but we are starting basically from scratch. In a similar manner, I have no idea which airlines and which planes are better than others, only that a ton of people are not impressed with United.

Original layover in Detroit was 39 minutes, which I felt was tight but doable. Then Delta nudged back my 1st leg flight departure, making the layover a riskier 29 minutes. Now trying to decide what my best move is. Do nothing and hope everything goes perfectly and I make the connection? Try to get rebooked on a later flight from Detroit (one left in the day, would mean getting into Boston a couple hours later - not ideal but beats spending the night in Detroit)? Or try to get rebooked through a different connecting city (would Delta accommodate this without a fee? I read <30mins violates the minimum change time)

If it matters, flight booked through Citi?s travel portal using TY points. Thanks for any advice!

TL;DR - flight time change cuts a layover to 29 minutes, exploring options"

I'm looking at a couple of flights to Italy. I noticed Air France and KLM are selling tickets cheaper than Delta. But both Air France and KLM are operated by Delta. I'm assuming I'm flying on Delta plane; just discounted price from Air France and KLM to fill up the plane. I'm planning to use my Amex Delta Gold card to get free checked bags and priority seating. 

If I purchase my tickets from KLM or Air France will I not get free checked bags, priority seatings and skymiles vs buying from Delta site?"

In the meantime, I'd like some clarification.  
I bought a Tulsa - Glasgow roundtrip flight, very cheap. Tulsa - Atlanta - Amsterdam - Glasgow, then back home to Tulsa from Glasgow.  
I misunderstood hidden city flights, I suppose (because I've done this before), and I booked accommodations in Amsterdam. I intend to leave the Amsterdam Airport, and only go to Glasgow at the end of my trip to fly home to Tulsa.   
  
Can I ask Delta to cancel my Amsterdam to Glasgow flight? Tonight the customer service rep said if I miss any flight, they reserve the right to cancel the rest of my itinerary and put the tickets back up for sale. Very frustrating because I paid for the tickets and want to do as I please with them.

"2014-12-31 18:51:13"|"Muslims Eat Rice and Curry"|"I recently flew a united flight from LAX to DXB. The IAD to DXB leg was quite long so I decided to shell out and upgrade to BusinessFirst. That is where the nightmare begins.

After writing the following letter to Jeff Smisek, the CEO of united airlines, I received a phone call back. United thanked me for writing the letter, this of course after I was informed that the Lady I was talking to had been in the business for longer then I have been flying.

Here is the letter for your reading pleasure.

Dear Mr. Hand & Mr. Smisek, 

I recently flew on United Airlines from LAX to DXB to YYZ.  Along the duration of my flight?s there were a number of circumstances which led to this being the most awful travel experience of my flight career, which as a consultant I am in the air 48 weeks a year on business and another 2 weeks a year visiting family.

On my way from LAX to DXB, the flight attendant behaved in a very racist manner towards me, she served me my meal last and responded to any inquiries I had very rudely.  My request for a Halal meal lead to public scorn and embarrassment as your flight attendant very rudely informed me that the Halal meal needed to be ordered 2 hours prior to serving. I did in fact request the specific meal when upgrading my seat prior to departing LAX there seems to be a sort of disconnect within your company. Needless to say the mistreatment from the flight crew negatively impacted my travel experience. As a business first passenger there is a standard of treatment which I expect to be treated in.

But United, you guys never fail to disappoint. The return trip, has to be by far the worst experience I have had in life period. As is I am a 27 year old Muslim Male with a beard. So I am sure you could picture the already prejudice looks I get from, TSA, Airline Employees and fellow passengers. But nothing can top the actions of Ms. Lotta Von ?Something? (I couldn't get her last name because when I tried she took her name tag off.)

Ms. Lotta Von X let?s call her, approached  me upon reaching 10,000 feet, Mr.Chagleelee was my name on this flight (I thought literacy was a requirement but OK). I said yes, she said we have the Muslim meal for you.  I said, thank you, but aren't all the meals out of DXB halal? And that is when all hell broke loose.
I was screamed at and publicly humiliated, and I was told that I was not allowed to have any of the meals on the menu because I ordered the Muslim meal.
After being shouted at I asked what was in the Muslim Meal anyway, the response was priceless ?rice and curry or whatever you Muslims eat.? At that point I had enough, I began speaking to another Air Host and his apology was truly one of a kind. ?Yeah, its ok she can come off like that?. As if expecting me to be patient and understanding with her. Then Ms. Lotta now comes back and refills my sprite with water, which then took her the duration of the flight to rectify because I never got another one from her. As a matter of fact, I had to get up and go the galley to get a drink.

The best part of all of this is that I was sitting next to a Senior Vice President of (Sorry I have to edit this out), who looked at me and said, ?I am shocked, I have never seen anything like this.?

The final flight from Dulles to Toronto, there was no Premier access on boarding, no first class or Economy plus, and once again the Gate agent was extremely rude as well as oblivious and unable to effectively respond to my inquiries regarding the flight details. (Please do explain why I am paying an arm and a leg for this?)

My total flight time was around 30 hours which I would consider fairly long, as such I chose to upgrade in order to receive more comfortable seating as well as more personal service. Yes the seating was adequate however the horrific service provided lead me to reconsider my decision of choosing United Airlines entirely. I am an avid flyer and this is the first time I have experienced such poor behavior from crew members and the remainder of the airlines personnel?s.  It seems throughout my multiple flight?s there seems to be some common animosity from the crew members toward the Halal/Muslim meal displaying racist behavior. Would this be ordinary behavior to be expected by United Airlines, if so United Airlines will most definitely not be a part of my future travels plans. The saddest part of all this, this is the first United flight since accepting the premier match challenge. I think I will stay with Delta. In all the flights I have ever taken with them or any other airline for that matter, I have never been as appalled as to write a letter of complaint. I would like to thank you guys for giving me this opportunity to experience a new first.

I will be flying into Hanoi, spending just over 3 weeks exploring the country, and flying home out of Ho Chi Minh City.

I want to preemptively book some sort of a beach hut near Ho Chi Minh city, so that I have a place already booked in advance, and can just sort of arrive from the north, kick back, and relax before my flight home.

I have looked up popular beaches and have started looking at various resorts, hotels, guest houses, etc. and there's (obviously) a lot of options.  So I thought I'd ask here in case somebody might have some ideas for me.

- I will be saving money along the way staying in hostels, so I don't mind splurging a bit on something nice on the beach for the last couple days/nights in the country.  But if I find a nice hostel with private rooms, I want to consider that as an option as well, as I enjoy mingling with other backpackers.

- I want to stay somewhere that's close to some ""night out on the town"" type establishments in the evening..  so bars, pubs, restaurants, etc.  It doesn't have to be right next door, but I want to be somewhere where I can walk 5-10 minutes and be in the middle of party central.  Having said that I don't want to be right in the middle of party central, so that I can actually rest at night.

- I am still not sure how many days/nights I will spend in Ho Chi Minh before my flight home..  For now I'm going with 1-2 days max..    However, I also had thoughts to maybe check out the Mekong delta, if I have time, and make a day trip out of that.  I suspect I will be a bit tired from all the travel near the end of my trip and might just want to relax on the beach and not really spend more than 1 day exploring Ho Chi Minh and taking it in, but am open to suggestions.

Usually I book things as I go, but you can find much better deals on swanky beach resorts, beach huts, etc. if you book in advance.  So I want to take a look and see if I can find something that meets my criteria, but wouldn't mind some tips as to where exactly I should be looking.

I will be travelling 1-2 months from now.

Thanks for reading!"

While in Vancouver, our flight to Seattle that was due to leave at 1815 was delayed due to Seattle having snow. The delta rep at the kiosk said Seattle airport was ""shut down"".

During this time, two other flights left Vancouver bound for Seattle from WestJet and Air Canada.

At around 1950, the flight from Delta was cancelled. We were given red cards with a number on it, saying we could change our flights there. But we were also told that Delta would not cover hotels due to the cancellation being due to weather.

So what are my options here? I've bit the bullet and rented a hotel for the night - my wife has medical conditions and can't sleep on a bench. I was on the phone with delta for hours, but they pretty much told me I need to talk to someone on the ground, and all of them have gone home.

"2011-08-30 04:09:02"|"I'm about to start traveling a lot more, on my own dime; how can I be efficient about it?"|"I live in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois.  We have a small airport, from which only American Airlines departs.  There's a second airport used for chartered flights, but since I'm paying for this out of pocket I doubt I'll be using any of those.  There's also an Amtrak station.

There are two airports (Midway and O'Hare) in Chicago, each of which is about 2.5 hours away, depending on traffic.  There's another airport in Bloomington-Normal, which is about 1 hour away (and has no backscatter machines and parking is free).  Indianapolis is also reachable, and is about 2 hours away (though with the time zone change, if I start driving at 5, I arrive at 8; but if I leave Indianapolis at 5, I get back at 6).  BMI is usually cheapest; if not, MDW is.  Indy has never had the lowest fares.

There's a moderate to significant chance that I'll wind up moving to Chicago at some point, but I've been saying that for years; each time the option comes up, I remember I hate moving and stay put.

This year I'll be flying to Denver, Colorado on Frontier Airlines out of MDW, and am also tentatively planning a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana for early October (most likely on Delta from BMI); the problem with this strategy is I'm only picking the cheapest individual flight I can find on Hipmunk, which doesn't necessarily work to my long term advantage.

Next year I am 85% confident I'll be going to Sweden in July (most likely on KLM); other significant destinations of varying confidence intervals are Canada (probably Toronto), Seattle, California, New York, New Jersey, and South Carolina.  There may be more, but those are the ones to which I think I'm likely to fly.  I also know I'll be traveling to Iowa, Wisconsin, and Missouri, but those are drivable distances.

I don't care very much about getting status or flying exceptionally comfortably (or don't understand why not caring is a bad idea), just flying cheap with a minimum of civil rights violations.  I'm not currently taking advantage of any credit card rewards or frequent flier programs and don't know where to begin.

How can I minimize my average cost of flying over the long term?  This includes the cost of taking vacation days in order to travel, which is why I try not to drive places more than 4 hours away and won't drive places more than 8 hours away.  Similarly, I avoid Amtrak because it means taking a vacation day just to travel, even though the dollar cost is cheaper.

Good morning guys. I wanted to write my frustration with American Airlines. I live down in Miami, but I always drive up to Fort Lauderdale to fly with Southwest. this time,  I, along with my family, flew out of Miami to Chicago. Although I had to pay for bag fees, and dumb seat fees in order for us to sit together, the flight from Miami to Chicago was great.

?On our way back to Miami, we had a connecting flight at Charlotte. First, I paid again the crazy seat fees and bag fee, our flight from Chicago got delayed and lost the connecting flight. Then, they switches us to a flight that was going to Fort Lauderdale. That flight was getting delayed every 30 minutes since 9 p.m. They cancelled it at midnight with the same bad weather excuse, and told us to go to customer service to change it. They delayed and cancelled a bunch of flights that night with the same bad weather excuse. What i found weird was that on the airport screen, I had noticed that Delta, United, and Southwest flights were on time. Only American flights were getting delayed and gate changed every now and then. In conclusion guys, I had to call work to tell them that I couldn't make it to work the next day, buy food, and sleep at the airport with my family. There were pregnant women, little kids, very old people, and American Airlines didn't even give food or place to sleep. I just wanted to share my experience, as I might not fly with them again."
"2016-12-21 14:39:38"|"Have any of my fellow Reddit members gotten a refund from Delta airlines?"|"Hello, and happy holidays! I recently traveled with Delta to Italy. (My flight was on Friday, December 16) The flight was originally supposed to board at 7:15 and depart at 8:15. When I got to the gate the flight was delayed an hour, no big deal. I boarded the plane around 9:15ish, we taxied to the runway and were about to take off when the pilot announced that he had made a mistake and should not have left the gate because the ground/maintenance crew had not signed off on the flight log, due to a broken water valve. We returned to the gate and had to wait on the plane for four plus hours while they repaired the valve. The pilot had no idea what was going on, he informed us it would be a quick fix, then that it was worse then they originally thought, then that we were going to switch aircrafts, and then finally that they were going to remove all of the baggage, to shut off a different valve so the water could not reach the broken valve. Finally after five hours of delay we took off, and I thought ""the worst is behind me, and soon I'll be reunited with my girlfriend and all will be well"" (My girlfriend studied abroad in Florence for the semester) boy was I wrong. We were served a very dissatisfying meal of what they called ""vegetarian lasagna"", I assumed this would be lasagna with only cheese and no meat; however, it was an eggplant lasagna which gave me food poisoning. I spent my first four days in Italy stuck in the hotel room with all of the symptoms that accompany food poising. (I'll spare you the details) Anyways this really put a damper on my trip and ruined my stay in Florence. I am just becoming well enough to eat solid foods again, which really sucks as I was looking forward to enjoying a lot of Italian cuisine. My flight was overpriced due to it being so close to the holiday, $1,300 to be exact. Which for me a 21 year old, full-time college student is a good chunk of cash. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experience getting refunded from Delta or any airline for that matter, and if this would be grounds for a refund. I know to some this will not sound like a big deal, and that I should not complain but it's all relative to my circumstance, being a young, in debt, college student, who had not seen his girlfriend of three years in over four months. 

Let me know what you guys think."

You should spend 2 days (actually 1 is enough) exploring Saigon, it's enough to visit all the tourist attractions in the center of Saigon and Cu Chi tunnel. Honestly speaking, I won't recommend spending much time in Saigon if you want to experience the best Vietnamese culture in a short time. Notice: MANY STUDENTS WANT YOU TO PRACTISE ENGLISH WITH THEM IF YOU ARE CAUCASIAN, this is very common, so don't worry if you're asked to talk, some students will even give you a small present to thank you for your kindness. If you are a partier, you definitely ought to stay at a hostel around Bui Vien street, it only takes about $5-8 for one night as you wanna stay in a dorm room, as there are many bars and the prices are quite cheap around that area.
Mekong Delta is a magnetic tourist attraction, I suggest visiting and stay here for 2 days. What's better than sitting on a small boat and watching the life on Mekong river? You have opportunities to go through the authentic Vietnamese culture by working with peasants as well! 
Next stop: Ba Ria-Vung Tau. Many tourists ignore this beautiful coastal province although it's really worth visiting. It's 100 km far away from Saigon. You'll pass over Ba Ria on your way to Vung Tau from Saigon. Vung Tau has gorgeous beaches, obviously, they're not as stunning as ones in Nha Trang, however, you'll love the peaceful atmosphere of the city. Most importantly, one of the biggest statues in the world is belonged to the city, it's the Jesus Christ the King statue, which is quite similar to the statue in Rio, located on the top of a mountain. Bach Dinh is another place which is worth visiting, it's a historical building, you are able see stuff used by the last king of Vietnam there. Ba Ria, in which you are able to learn how 2 traditional foods known as pho and bun (rice noodle) are made in the so-called Long Kien neighborhood, is only 25 km away from Vung Tau. Ho Tram, which is about 50km away from Ba Ria, has a very famous 5-star-hotel (and casino) whose name is The Grand Ho Tram Strip; therefore, if you want to stay at a luxury hotel, it'll be the best choice! There are a lot of other things to do here, if you need detailed information with this destination, I'm always willing to help! From Ho Tram, you can head straight to Mui Ne! In my opinion, spending 2 days in this province is enough.
Mui Ne: this is called ""Vietnamese desert"". Endless sand and great beaches! Ponashu tower, which was built in 1200 years ago, is a place you must visit. You should spend 2 days here.

It was between Thailand/Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan (I'm fairly positive the surge in travel advertisement from Japan tourism agencies I've seen had some effect on me :p).

**Question:** As an American who has only traveled to places like Australia and Western Europe I'm a little intimidated. Where should I start when searching for places and things to see in Japan? What resources are good to utilize to accomplish this?

**Time:** Later this year, probably September-November. I'd be able to spend about two weeks there (two work weeks and the weekends on each side).

**Interests:** I am a foodie/craft beer and spirits enthusiast. I love to try new things, and meet new people! I definitely want to check out Tokyo and the cities, but as I've historically only spent time in a city when traveling I want to spend at least half my time in rural areas that are less populated and maybe even enjoy some hiking. I really enjoy learning about different cultures, museums, ways of living.

Non-interests: Not huge into shopping.

**Way I like to travel:** I often enjoy minimal luggage and like to travel with a backpack, usually preferring to leave any luggage at home. At most I'll bring a collapsible backpack with inside my main for items/food I gather on the way and want to bring home. Hostels/AirBnB over hotels are fine for me, not purely for budget but I like the way many are structured.

**Budget:** I prefer to spend my money on experiences, food and events. I usually spend my accommodation in cheaper choices like hostels and AirBnb's. I always check out a locations public transit before looking into taxi's/ride sharing/private transportation. 

For my trip to Japan, I expect to get there on a free ticket with my built up Delta miles. I would be aiming for around $2,000 as a trip budget goal after accommodation, food, and entertainment/experiences.

**Concerns:** I often end up traveling solo, as an English speaking American would that make things incredibly challenging at all? I'm not afraid to do some leg work to learn certain phrases and I'm ok with being thrown out of my comfort zone. My goal is to visit somewhere for the first time that is sufficiently different than my daily life and culture.

I have purchased a one-way ticket from HNL to LHR via StudentUniverse. I was recently cautioned by my mom's boyfriend that the UK requires proof of onward travel for people entering the country.

&#x200B;

I plan on flying on my US passport (though I do also have a Japan passport as I was born with dual citizenship, this will be relevant later). I have done a lot of googling and have found conflicting info. I have found many people stating that in all cases you should have proof of onward travel with you before traveling.

&#x200B;

However, some have stated that it is not required for students intending to studying in the UK. Some have claimed that this also applies to those with a short-term study visa, though I have seen more people claim that this is true with the Tier 4 Student Visa. Also, as I am traveling on my US passport I was told that rather than applying for a Short Term Study Visa before leaving I would not need a visa to study in the UK for up to 6 months if I can provide all required documentation upon arrival.

&#x200B;

I will be entering the UK on January 9th, and my current plans are to leave on June 8th (or sometime during the week before). My current plans are to visit my family in Japan while I apply for a postgraduate program at the university in London I would be studying at. For this purpose, I am looking at one-way tickets from London to Japan (my family lives in Hiroshima, but I am looking at flights to Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Hiroshima). As a Japan passport holder, I would not need proof of onward travel for entry into that country.

&#x200B;

Also, my current girlfriend in London is considering flying to Japan with me and staying for a short time. If that is the case, I would like to fly to Japan with her on the same flight. She does not know if she would be able to afford it at the moment.

&#x200B;

I have read on some places online that Heathrow Airport is notorious among one-way travelers and digital nomads for asking for proof of onward travel. Also, I will be flying on Delta Air Lines, and have also heard that Delta has a reputation for asking for proof of onward travel before allowing you to board their flights.

&#x200B;

So my question is, would I need proof of onward travel? If so, how can I get that (LEGALLY) without compromising the flexibility I want? What would be the cheapest and most reliable way of doing so?

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, thank you for actually bothering to read the whole thing."

However, going onto WestJet's website, I can't set the departure city to LEX in their online check-in tool. It's just not an option. Does this mean the airport doesn't support online check-in?

Worth noting the flight is `WestJet #### operated by ENDEAVOR AIR DBA DELTA CONNECTION `. I'm assuming this still means I use WestJet for the checkin, though, and not Delta, as all the connecting flights are WestJet."

When I fly a major airline like delta the flights are smooth and even after warning of rough air the storms are diverted and we make a smooth landing.

I've heard you should arrive at the airport about two hours prior to your flight's departure time, is that true?

I would imagine no one prints out their tickets anymore, right?  I booked my flight through Delta via Travelocity, so can I just download Delta's app, punch in my ticket number and then it'll give me like a digital ticket to present at the gate on my phone?

That's all I can think of for now.  Sorry for all the annoying newbie questions.  Please feel free to share any other tips. "

**Edit:** Made a call to Delta Airlines to ask about this specific thing and was told that I would not have to pay any extra fees for my bags as part of a connecting flight. My guess would be due to Delta and Korean Air being part of the same Skyteam Alliance? "

"2016-07-20 23:01:40"|"Vietnam & Cambodia 2 week itinerary input"|"Hello, I'm planning a 2 week trip to Vietnam and Cambodia in mid November with my girlfriend and wanted to get some input on our itinerary. We fly in and out of Ho Chi Minh city, tickets are already purchased (depart from U.S.). 

We're both late 20s and enjoy outdoor activities such as kayaking & light hiking, seeing the big tourist/historic sites (i.e. TripAdvisor's list of thing to do), and eating. I'm more into museums than she is so we'll go to one or two. She'll probably want a day to lounge at a beach or pool (does an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay cover that?). We'll get drinks at a bar, but neither of us are big on partying/clubbing. Budget wise I'd say we're somewhere in the middle... private hostel rooms instead of shared bunks, but no hotel penthouses.

I know 2 weeks is not ideal and people will say we need 2 months for this trip, but that's not really an option since we both work. We usually do one big international trip a year, so we'd like to see both countries while we're there. Below is the itinerary I have in mind. Are we cramming too much in, missing any must sees, spending too much time in a city that doesn't offer much?

Day 1: land in HCM at 11am

Day 2: Ho Chi Minh

Day 3: Ho Chi Minh - Mekong Delta?

Day 4: fly to Hanoi around noon

Day 5: Hanoi

Day 6: Ha Long Bay, overnight cruise

Day 7: Ha Long Bay, bus back to Hanoi

Day 8: fly to Siem Reap

Day 9: Siem Reap - Angkor Wat

Day 10: Siem Reap - Angkor Wat

Day 11: Siem Reap

Day 12: bus to Phnom Penh

Day 13: Phnom Penh

Day 14: fly to HCM

Day 15: fly home

"2019-10-03 03:15:48"|"Just got back from an amazing honeymoon in Italy and Greece! Full recap and details."|"I posted this over in r/weddingplanning, but I figured you folks might appreciate it also. This was my second international trip and my husband's first. We got to do a lot in 11 days (12 days counting travel time), so I hope this recap is helpful to someone planning a similar trip! I wrote a whole lot below, so I tried to highlight the things I really liked in **bold.**

**BUDGET: \~$5,000**

We booked as much as possible in advance: flights, hotels, train tickets, tour tickets, etc. When all was said and done, we spent about $4,200 booking everything. Then all we had to pay on the actual honeymoon was minor daily expenses like food and a couple of taxi rides. All in all, I think we came in right around $5k.

**ITINERARY**

9/14: Wedding day! We live in Florida but wedding was in New York.

9/16: Overnight flight from NY to Venice, Italy

9/17: Arrive in Venice, stay 1 night

9/18: Venice to Florence, stay 2 nights

9/20: Florence to Rome, stay 2 nights

9/22: Rome to Santorini, stay 2 nights

9/24: Santorini to Mykonos, stay 2 nights

9/26: Mykonos to Athens, stay 1 night

9/27: Fly home, Athens to NY

**DAILY RECAP**

**9/17, Venice:** We took an overnight flight, so we arrived in Venice at about 11 a.m. We took a small boat from the airport to the actual city. We were able to check into our hotel and our room was ready early, which was nice, and we were staying right next to the **Rialto Bridge** which is a great area. We dropped our things off and went to walk around a bit and grab lunch. Venice is unlike any city I've ever seen. It's all narrow alleyways and water! Getting around can get kind of confusing, but it's also really fun. After lunch we went back to the hotel for a much-needed nap. That night we went for a **Gondola ride**, which is pricey but worth it for the experience. We then went to a wine bar for some amazing wine and light snacks, then grabbed pizza (also amazing) on the way back to the hotel. We passed out hard from exhaustion!

**9/18, Venice and Florence:** We got up fairly early to grab coffee and a croissant at a nearby bakery. Then we went to **Saint Mark's Basilica** and Doge's Palace. We went inside St. Mark's and it was absolutely stunning. We did not care to pay the entrance fee to Doge's, so we just looked from the outside. Then we went to the local Da Vinci Museum. It's very small, but was interesting. We had more pizza for lunch at a place called **Rossopomodoro** and it was great. Then we caught the 2pm train to Florence. The ride was about 2 hours. In Florence, we checked into our hotel (**Hotel Monna Lisa** \- highly recommend!) and relaxed a bit. That evening we went to the **Mercato Centrale** in Florence, a huge food hall with tons of amazing food and wine. We ate way too much, then checked out a couple of local bars. It was an amazing evening!

**9/19, Florence:** Morning coffee and pastry at a local bakery. Then we headed out for the day, first visiting the **Statue of David**, which was amazing to see in person. Then we walked to the **Piazzale Micelangelo**, which is about a 30 minute walk outside the city but so worth it. It's a huge plaza overlooking all of Florence, and the view is amazing! We then walked back into Florence and visited the Duomo. We hadn't bought tickets in advance, which it turns out is required to schedule a time to actually go in the dome. But we did get to climb the bell tower and had an amazing view from there. We got sandwiches for lunch from the nearby **Panini Toscani**. We were pretty exhausted from the walking and climbing, so we went back to the hotel and napped a bit. That evening, we had a glass of wine in the hotel garden, then headed out to our dinner reservations at **La Bottega Del Buon Caffe**. This was an absolute highlight of the trip! It's a Michelin-starred restaurant and it was absolutely incredible. We then went for drinks at nearby **Rasputin**, a gothic-themed ""secret bar"" which was really neat. Unfortunately, we were really tired and full of food and didn't have the energy to stay very long, but the one drink I had was good.

**9/20,** **Florence and Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then headed out to grab lunch at a small pizza shop, **Gustarium,** which was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD. Then we headed to the train station for our 1pm train to Rome. We had a hiccup here which was that we had planned to take the bus to the train station (we had taken the local bus to the restaurant the night before and it was so easy!) but at this time all of the busses were completely full. We couldn't get on a bus and were risking missing our train so we ended up walking the \~20 minutes to the station with our huge backpacks, which wasn't too fun. But we made it! It was about an hour and a half to Rome, where we took a cab to our Airbnb. We put down our stuff and then immediately headed out to grab an early ""dinner"" at **Sfiziarte** \- a casual sit-down eatery near the vatican. Food was so good! We then headed to Vatican City. Going here was a lifelong dream of mine and it did not disappoint. We saw St. Peter's Basilica, though we did not go inside. Then we headed to the **Vatican Museum** at 5pm for a **night tour** of the museum. They do these on Friday nights and it was SO worth it. Our tour guide was amazing and the museums are way less crowded at night. We saw and learned so much, with the tour ending in the **Sistine Chapel**! We then checked out a few bars in the area before heading back to the BnB.

**9/21, Rome:** We relaxed for the morning and then went to lunch at **Alfredo Alla Scrofa,** which is the birthplace of fettuccine alfredo! It was great and also happened to be right by our Airbnb. Then we did a 3 hour guided tour of the colosseum and ancient Rome. The sights were amazing and we learned a lot, but 3 hours was a bit long in my opinion. We grabbed a snack at another great pizza place, **Pizza e Mozzarella**, then headed over to a different area of Rome where we planned to go to dinner at a popular restaurant called Tonnarello. Unfortunately there was a huge wait for dinner and we ended up going to another restaurant in the area, **Otello**, which also ended up being amazing! There were also a ton of small bars in this area with great specials, so we hung out there until we needed to go back and get some sleep.

**9/22, Rome and Santorini:** We headed to the airport first thing in the morning for our flights to Athens and then Santorini (there are no direct flights to the greek islands). We arrived in Santorini at around 4pm. We had been really excited to go here because we splurged on a honeymoon suite at our hotel (**Aeolos Studios**) and wow, it did not disappoint. We had a balcony with a jacuzzi overlooking the volcano. It was incredible! We had an amazing dinner at nearby restaurant **Aktaion,** then went to **MoMix**, a molecular mixology bar with fun and interesting drinks. We were tired from traveling so we didn't stay out too late.

**9/23, Santorini:** This was one of the busiest days of our trip because there was so much we wanted to do! We had lunch at a restaurant called Avocado, which was very highly reviewed but I thought was just okay (I just got a salad though so maybe that's why). Then we headed down to the Old Port of Santorini to go on a **volcano hot springs cruise**. Getting to the old port is no easy feat, as you have to climb down 587 stairs to reach it! There is also a cable car that can take you down, but the line was incredibly long so we chose the stairs. It was exhausting but a pretty cool experience. The cruise itself was amazing! We hiked the volcano (which still has an active crater, seeing the sulfer was so cool), and then got in the water at a nearby hot spring. We got back around 5:30 very tired and dirty, raced back to our hotel to change (we took the cable car back up thank goodness), and then left again for dinner. We had another incredible dinner with a view at **Argo.** After dinner we stopped at a romantic bar on the way back to our hotel, **Mylos**, for a nice drink with another great view.

**9/24, Santorini and Mykonos:** We woke up and the weather was awful! We'd had breakfast plans, but it was so foggy and rainy outside we didn't feel like leaving the hotel, so we just got room service. At noon we had to head to the port (different port from yesterday) to take our ferry over to Mykonos. We actually got very lucky because there was a ferry strike on this day and most ferries were cancelled, but for some reason ours wasn't! It was very stressful waiting to find out. We arrived in Mykonos and checked into our hotel, where we rested for a while. Then we went into the main area of Mykonos for dinner and drinks. We had heard a lot about the nightlife in Mykonos and wanted to experience it, and we certainly did! We went to a few places, but my favorites were **Alley Cafe** (which is actually just a bar) and **Skandinavian Bar**, which is a dance club. We both definitely had too much to drink and neither of us really remember getting back to the hotel, so maybe that wasn't too smart. But we had a blast dancing the night away! It was definitely the party night of the trip.

**9/25, Mykonos:** I woke up regretting my decisions the night before, as I was pretty hungover and couldn't get out of bed for several hours. We did manage to get up in the early afternoon and take a bus down to Paradise Beach, where we had lunch at a great restaurant, **Indian Palace**. We went to the beach but not for too long, then we took the bus back to Mykonos Town. I almost threw up on the bus due to being hungover so it wasn't great. We rested a bit more at the hotel, then went to **Karavaki Restaurant** for dinner. The restaurant is on top of a huge hill and has an amazing view, though it was a bit of a hike to get there! We went to bed super early due to our early flight the next morning.

**9/26, Mykonos and Athens:** We had a 6:40 a.m. flight out of Mykonos, so we were up by 4 a.m. It was tough but it ended up being worth it to have the whole day in Athens! We got into Athens by 7:30 a.m. and went to our hotel **(Palladian Home)**. They were able to have our room ready within the hour, which was great because we got to take a morning nap. Around noon we went out for a **3 hour guided tour of the Acropolis** and the related museum. I have always loved ancient Greece, so this was an incredible experience, although similar to the last tour I felt like 3 hours was a little too long and it dragged on at times. But we still loved it! I was singing Hercules songs all day, lol. That night, we decided to check out two bars that are on the World's 50 Best Bars List, **The Clumsies** and **Baba au Rum**. Both bars were incredible and it was a great end to our trip!

**9/27, Athens and New York:** We headed straight to the airport in the morning for a flight out at 9:25 a.m. The 10.5 hour flight home was pretty miserable (two hours longer than the flight on the way there), and I'm still adjusting from the jet lag, but it was so worth it!

**WHAT I LOVED**

The whole trip was easily the best trip of my life, and my husband agreed! I loved pretty much every second of it, but these are the things that really made it great:

* The itinerary - I was a bit nervous about hopping cities every 1-2 days, but it actually worked out great. We got to see a million things, but it was also never too stressful, as we found plenty of time to just relax and rest. I might make one change (noted below), but otherwise I think it was the perfect mix of relaxation and sightseeing.
* The prices, especially in Italy - we were so pleasantly surprised by how affordable everything was! You could find a big glass of wine for 3 euro pretty much anywhere in Italy, maybe 4 euro in Greece. Entrees which would cost $15-20 in America were generally under 10 euro. The islands were a bit more expensive, which makes sense. It was nice to enjoy all these restaurants and bars without feeling too guilty about our budget.
* The food! Not much to say here, just the food in both countries was absolutely incredible, so much fresher and more flavorful than what you find 90% of the time in America.
* Silly shirts - we got a bunch of those cheesy honeymoon couples shirts, regular Mr. and Mrs. ones as well as nerdy themed ones, and we had so much fun wearing them. I know it's not everyone's jam, but we figured this was the one time to ham it up. Plus, plenty of people noticed and offered us congratulations, and we got a free bottle of wine at 3 of our hotels!
* They honeymoon suite - we kept our accommodations pretty modest for most of the trip, but the honeymoon suite we splurged on in Santorini was so worth it. We relaxed in our balcony jacuzzi both nights overlooking an incredible view. Santorini itself was the most beautiful place I have ever seen and was just an overall highlight of the trip.
* Dinner at Bottega in Florence - I mentioned in the daily recap, but this was another splurge that was totally worth it. Neither of us had dined at a Michelin restaurant before and we were just completely blown away. It was the best meal of my life!

**WHAT I MIGHT DO DIFFERENTLY**

There are very few things I would change, but here are a couple of things that might have made the trip even better:

* Mykonos - If I could do it again, I'm not sure I would include the two nights in Mykonos in the itinerary. Instead, we could have stayed for an extra night in Santorini and then done two nights in Athens instead of one. It would have saved us money and time on the ferry ride to Mykonos, plus it would have given us more time in those two cities that I liked a little better. Mykonos was fun (definitely had the most straight-up fun night of the trip there), but it's not terribly different from Santorini and I'm not sure it was worth the trouble to go to two islands.
* Guided tours - We loved the night tour of the Vatican and I would definitely do that one again! As to the other two tours (colosseum and acropolis), I'm torn. We did learn a lot, but it was too much information at times and it got a little bit tedious. I would do maybe a 2 hour tour, but not a 3 hour again.
* Norwegian flight - we flew on the way there with Delta, but our flight home was through Norwegian. We got it VERY cheap and I guess you do get what you pay for. Apparently Norwegian is having huge financial issues right now, so they're leasing out their flights to another company, Hi-Fly. The plane was easily from the 1990s and had none of the features that our Delta flight had. There was a screen on the back of the seat but it only played a movie at the beginning of the flight and the audio didn't work. Then we got the audio working but it didn't play any more movies. On a 10.5 hour flight! There were no outlets or anything, and my millenial ass didn't bring a physical book to read, just a kindle which died. My headphones (wireless), also died. So there was nothing to do on this 10.5 hour flight except try to sleep, which didn't happen because it was a daytime flight and we were located next to the bathroom so I was hearing A TOILET FLUSHING EVERY 30 SECONDS. We both nearly went stir crazy by the last couple of hours. Sorry, that was a bit of a rant, and a very first world problem, but seriously - I would pay for a better flight next time.

**CONCLUSION**

I hope this was a little bit helpful for someone! I know I wrote quite a lot, but I hope I conveyed how seriously amazing every day of the trip was. We're so sad that it's over but we're already planning our next international trip! I would HIGHLY recommend this itinerary for anyone considering it for their honeymoon or just a getaway. It was truly magical."

So, i just booked LAX to Inverness, which, according to Google Flights was going to be $537 or something like that with all fees and taxes included.  When I went to select the flight (2 of the same flight),  it had booking options for different booking parties ranging from  $1,054 (booking through a travel agent) to $1,628 (booking through KLM/Delta).  I tried to book through the $1,212 Air France option by phone.  When all is said and done, I paid $1,563.


So the  $537 flight ended up being $781.  What happened here??  Is there really a $537 price flight out there? Did I pick the wrong booking option? Is the cheapest price only if I book with a travel agent?


How can I avoid this sudden, very pricey markup when actually booking flights?"

I'm looking to head to East Asia on Monday, the 9th for some last minute travel, returning at the end of the month on the 28th (approximately 3 weeks). I'm looking to visit Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. I've got no real requirements other than great beaches, good/interesting things to see, and awesome food. My budget is going to be around $3K-$4K (after airfare) and can do a mix of luxury, tourist-y, and backpacker style tourism.

I have no idea where I should start or where I should end, other than knowing that I'll probably want to spend a bit of extra time in Southern Thailand relaxing on some beach somewhere.

What should I see? What should I avoid? What's the best way to get around (for those of you who have traveled to these countries). Any suggested itinerary? Preferred hotels or places you might have stayed at? Am I giving myself enough time to see all four countries?

Any help from those who have traveled here would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers!

Edit: Here's some additional info, based on the subreddit rules:

* I don't mind roughing it but prefer a little bit of comfort.
* I don't necessarily like tourist-y destinations unless there is something of historical or architectural of note (ie: if I were going to San Francisco, Fisherman's Wharf would not be cool, but the Golden Gate Bridge would be cool).
* I like warmth and water and jungle. A boat trip up one of the deltas would be cool.
* I live in a big city, don't desire to visit any on this trip. Countryside, seaside resorts or cottages, all of that is appealing.
* Beaches, beaches, water, water.
* I am a certified SCUBA diver; would love to get a few dives in although it's been quite a while since I've strapped the tanks on and would probably need a refresher course when I got there.
* I am open to any form of travel when I get there, trains and planes preferred.

Oh yes, I am woefully unprepared for this trip, but am looking to get out of my comfort zone and turn it into an adventure.

More details, and hoping for lodging and/or commuting recommendations: thinking a week down in the Gulf of Thailand on Ko Samui / Ko Pha-ngan / Ko Tao for some diving, then back to Bangkok to run into Laos for a few days (thinking Luang Prabang with optional side trip to either Vieng Veng or Si Phan Dong), then over to Vietnam if I can get my Visa in time (my thoughts here are Sapa, Hue and maybe Ho Chi Minh city; I've not heard good things about either Hanoi or Halong Bay). After that, back to Thailand and over to the Andaman Sea for a day or two in Phuket, a run up to Khao Lok for a jump to the Similan Islands, and if I have time left, Ko Phi Phi and maybe Railay (Ray Lay?) Beach for some rock climbing.

After that, a jump to San Francisco for three days of Wilco shows and then back to New York City to plan my next vacation."

It just barely is over in length and width (or something like that) for the carry-on dimensions. I'm wondering how anal Icelandair is with their carry-on bags. I am thinking of going in and switching it for the 45L but wanted to ask those who have flown it first.

Also, when it says a personal item, that means just your basic personal item that airlines such as Delta, Alaska, etc take? I usually bring a large-ish personal item and am worried they mean  some sort of tiny 6inch by 6inch personal item bag. 

Thank you and any other tips help! Have only flown Delta overseas so wondering how different this will be."

I was wondering if you could help me out with your personal preference on this.  If this is the wrong place to ask, kindly let me know who I could ask for this. 

I fly to Europe (from USA) about twice a year for work. Typically I always fly Lufthansa Premium. I have had a great track record with them ( only 1 issue). I find the reclining seats great, plus the Leg rest is incredible. 

Recently I was booking my flight and I now see that Delta has a Premium + option available, that wasn't previously available.   Our budget is $3k / flight, so First Class is out of reach (without me forking money out of my pocket to get it), However Premium + is within reach (about $2,500 round trip). 

I can tell from the Delta website that it is about the same as Lufstansa. 

My variables are the following. 

? Domestically I always fly Delta. My city is a hub, so I get direct flights to where I need to go. This means I am part of the Frequent Flyer program. 

? The Delta flight looks to only be upgraded from my City to Amsterdam. From Amsterdam onward it is a 1-2 hour standard flight. This means about 4 ours total of flying with cramped legs (i am tall with bad knees).

    1 day in Hanoi
    2 days in Sapa
    (1 day in Hanoi) - or straight to Halong Bay?
    3 days in Halong Bay
    3 days in Phong Nha-Ke Bang
    2 days in Hue
    3 days in Hoi An
    1 day in Da Lat + Mui Ne
    2 days in HCMC
    1 day in Mekong Delta
    1 day in Hanoi

The last day we are going back to Hanoi, so we are sure we can catch the plane back to Denmark.

**A couple of questions:**

We still can?t decide between Sapa or Ha Giang. We are leaning towards Ha Giang, but it just seems easier traveling to and from Sapa. Do you have any experience with Ha Giang or any recommendations? We want to do a homestay.

Can we go straight from Sapa/Ha Giang to Halong Bay?

We are traveling from Hue ? Hoi An on a motorbike - do you have a good tour reference?

We would love a tour on a motorbike from Da Lat to Mui Ne or HCMC. It would be nice if it was just a couple of days. Do you have a good tour reference?

And lastly, is there something on our itinerary you would change to something else? Something we should skip? Or is there anything we're missing?

It is important for us to travel on a budget and to see as much as possible, but not to rush through it. We hope someone can help us! Thank you :-)

As I mentioned, most of our locations are serviced by AA, but we are required to book travel through an agency and are basically required to pick the lowest logical fare.

US citizen. Have flown international only once before.  Will have just a carry-on and maybe a personal item, no checked bags.   Have TSA Pre.  

Flight is in May, leaving from a small US airport heading into Minneapolis.  Once in MSP, heading to Europe.  Carrier is Delta or Delta partner(s)

I'm getting quite concerned that the layover in MSP is only 1 hr and 5 min.   That's cutting it close.  Way close.  And I'm a bit spooked by it now  (funny that it didn't bother me much when I first booked it) .  

The wife and I both opted for the Delta Comfort+ for the extra leg room.  

Looks like Delta says if we want to re-book and arrive in MSP earlier, we'd forfeit what we already put down for the Comfort+.

So, if we are already confirmed through all parts of the trip, carry-on only, ( TSA pre  but should have cleared security already so moot at that point) is that 1:05 layover enough to probably make that flight? 

ETA::  UPDATE
Found the email from Delta.  Looks to be single ticket, one confirmation etc.  Apparently I made this reservation way back in July  ( no wonder I can't remember jack-all about it).  And I dunno why, but somehow got it into my head that I had to be at the gate earlier for an international than a domestic...even though I'll be ""checking in"" online 24 hours or so in advance.  Crazy things us inexperienced old folks come up with.  I hope to be traveling much more in my future, so maybe someday I can be as helpful as you have been  (seriously, no snark)

It looks like Milan isn't the kind of place where one hangs out for 6 nights so we are now evaluating new options / alternatives with the help of a couple friends.  The only restriction I have is the flight back to the states is early on the 29th so I'd like to spend the night in Milan on the 28th.  I wanted to get some input from you fine folk on the below ideas:

* MILAN->FLORENCE->VENICE->MILAN: Fly into Milan on the 29th and then take an Air Italia flight directly into Florence.  This will get us to Florence and is recommended as a great city to travel in.  We would AirBNB there for three nights before taking another flight (maybe train to see the countryside?) into Venice.  We'd stay in Venice for two nights and then head back to Milan (either flight or train again).  Spend a night in Milan and then fly out the following morning.

* MILAN->ROME->FLORENCE->MILAN: Fly into Milan on the 29th and then take an Air Italia flight directly into Rome.  Spend two nights in Rome and then head up to Florence either with a train or a flight.  Is that a nice train ride?  Isn't the west coast of Italy pretty?  Spend three nights in Florence then head to Milan to be there the night before the trip.

TL;DR best way to get compensation for delayed-for-maintenance flights on 3 separate airlines.

Long Story:

Not to say that someone else hasn?t had worse luck and worse flight delays, but my most recent trip was chalk full of delays on different airlines and while I?m totally fine now that I?m home, I?m still annoyed. I?m looking for advice on the best way to get reimbursement from each airline. Currently, I am planning on just going through each airline?s customer service phone line, but if there?s any other recommendations for what I should do, I?d love to hear them.

All of this flying is in the US

Flight 1: just me affected, delta airlines, got on flight, engine wouldn?t start, deplaned after an hour, flight delayed a total of 3ish hours, normal connecting flight would have been missed so they rebooked me to a different airport where I eventually made it to my destination 5 hours after us should have, 5 hours of work missed, somewhat important meeting missed.

Flight 2: my in-laws flight was delayed/cancelled(not sure) due to maintenance, American Airlines, AA rebooked them on a later flight causing them to miss a paint and sip class that I paid for, in-laws have no interest in paying me back but (if it?s easy enough) they?ll go through the reimbursement process for the paint class and give me the reimbursement, I know it?s only $60 but I?d rather not eat that

Flight 3: return trip home for me and wife, United Airlines, flight delayed due to maintenance (incoming flight landed but there was an issue so they lazily (yes I?m most upset about this flight) went and grabbed another plane from the hangar), flight was delayed about 1hr and 15min which essentially ate up all of our layover time at the next airport and we ran about a mile (not exaggerating) through the airport and made it to our connecting flight literally as the gate agent was walking away to shut the door, the whole plane waited just for us which was really nice but if we would have been 30 seconds later the doors would have been closed. Yes we made this connecting flight but I?m pissed about me and my wife having to run through the airport to barely make the flight

So 3 different airlines, 3 different situations, what?s my best options here? Thanks in advance for the suggestions.

Side note on Flight 1: Delta overbooked the flight by 2 people and offered 2 $800 dollar Amazon gift cards for people to take a later flight, guess who wasn?t smart enough to take that offer? Me and 100 other people :("

I'm trying to decide if I should head to Myanmar next after a truly disastrous trip to Vietnam, however. I travel solo, mainly, and am a young-middle-aged woman who has been to a few dozen countries now, on several continents.

**Some things that I love about Southeast Asia:**

So I loved -- loved, loved, loved -- Cambodia and Laos, as well as Northern Thailand. These are three very different countries, but the people were nice in all of them, and the sights were fantastic! The cities were the right size and bustling but not hectic. I loved the jungle and waterfalls, I loved the relaxed vibe, there was always something to do, I loved the monks and monasteries and wats, the infrastructure was rugged in Laos but serviceable, and while I'm not a big foodie, I really liked especially Cambodian and Thai food, and thought Laotian food was also pretty good. I'm not huge on nightlife and keep to myself, a slow traveler who loves UNESCO heritage sights and historical places, stay mid-range to upmarket although I'm also fine as long as somewhere has running water (truly, don't care if it doesn't have hot showers or any amenities) and some nice people who smile and help out a bit. I like walking around and don't mind the heat unless it's extreme.

I love meeting people on the road too, but it's not essential for me as I do fine with my own company. I do make friends easily though, particularly on short tours (I cannot imagine easily taking a longer tour of more than a night or two). I like mainly very local experiences, however: watching kids play soccer at night or women haggling at the markets or a wedding.

I do not like overdevelopment or resorts, although a good swimming pool never hurts.

**Some things that I disliked about Southeast Asia:**

Vietnam was the fourth SEA country I went to, and it was by far the most developed. I was there for three weeks, really stuck it out, this was just in May/June, and went to North, Central, South, and the Mekong Delta (I did like the Mekong Delta, a lot). The thing that I struggled with in Vietnam, aside from the heat, were that it was harder to get around, plain and simple. The traffic was abysmal almost everywhere and no tuk tuks, just motos, which scare the Hell out of me. Also, I loved the sights in Hue, but beyond that, I found most to be small or unimpressive, with Hoi An a complete tourist trap. I had a hard time finding a way to get out of what felt like an endless urban or suburban sprawl, although I liked Hanoi's Old Quarter for its beauty, it was so manically busy that I was defeated about walking around after a few days. I also did not like the food, although I knew that in advance of the trip (part of this is unquestionably because I don't eat pork or beef). Ho Chi Minh City just reminded me of a very dirty version of Los Angeles. The people were not friendly to me overall, although those who were stood out in a wonderful way, but it was impossible to get close to anyone despite my trying to make conversation and while there, even going to local bia hois and ""the non-touristic parts of town,"" I found little possibility of being accepted into local spaces. So I was hot, claustrophobic, and bored. The happiest moments for me were seeing the floating markets of Cai Rang on the Mekong Delta and touring some of the local areas there, the sights in Hue, and a tour to Halong Bay.

The vibe though, it was kind of tense. It's also a deeply secular, very capitalist-driven country, ironically, and I couldn't even find local crafts or anything because it is just much more into mass commercialization, I guess. I found it pretty modern in an odd way.

It also felt oddly formal and well, not that much fun. No sense of pleasure going on, which I found even in Laos (even if the pleasure and party were sitting around at a tiny restaurant with two people).

The touts didn't help either. After three weeks, I was exhausted by their tenacity, picking me as a solo woman, assuredly.

**So, bearing on that in mind, any thoughts about how Myanmar would stack up?**

I am obsessed with seeing Bagan, no big surprise. But I am also mainly curious to see what the culture is like? Are there areas of beautiful jungle? Any wildlife? I love to watch monkeys and birds and that kind of thing. Is the food very bland or red-meat-heavy? Is the traffic overwhelming so that it's hard to walk around? Are the people friendly enough to smile when you smile at them? Is it chill?

I have really never disliked a place, but my last trip to Vietnam gave me pause (for the first time in my travels). I considered leaving repeatedly but had a single-entry visa and a flight back out of Vietnam, so it was not possible.

I like all kinds of places in the world.

How does Myanmar ""compare"" (if one can say that countries can compare) to Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in terms of travel, especially in consideration of my likes/dislikes."

Since we're from a small town, they had a connecting flight before they would reach their destination (all flights within US). Everything was booked through United Airlines.

They flew out on United, arriving at their layover on time. United then unexpectedly moved them over to a Delta connecting flight, but failed to transfer the funds apparently (according to Delta). So their bags were transported via the Delta flight, but they were denied entry. They went back to United who gave them compensation of a $10 voucher to be used in the airport on that day only, and a flight to their destination 10 hours later. Is there anything they can do to receive better compensation?

TL:DR United transferred connecting flight to Delta, but didn't transfer funds so Delta denied entry onto plane. United found another flight 10 hours later and compensated ruining the first two days of the honeymoon with $10 food voucher."

I?m gonna be using a Rimowa Salsa 32L as my only suitcase for the trip, as well as a smaller bag that includes small personal items (phone, cosmetics, etc.). Now I know that the 32L may be small for some, but I?m a very light packer. I?ve tested a suitcase of the same size and it?s able to fit my stuff, plus I?ll be cleaning clothes during the trip. 

Technically, the width of this suitcase is slightly over the allocation by the airline. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the strictness of Alitalia and if they?ll allow baggage slightly over the limits for carryons. Also, the people that I?m traveling with have bought the entire ?block? of seats that I?ll be seated in. None of them will be using carryons, so they will be more free room for myself. 

If the bag does have to be checked, I have a few concerns. What are the chances of it being lost? Will it get really damaged? I?m okay with a few scratches because I love the ?aged luggage? look, but I don?t want any major dents or scratches. Finally, is it possible to mark the luggage as fragile? I?ve heard of people doing this in the past.

I am currently sitting on a 737 that just touched down in JFK. This flight was suppose to leave this morning at 7:50am, 6 hour flight from Seattle to New York. Delta had a ""mechanical error"", apparently they couldn't find a part to the plane, and we did not take off until 1:00pm. Given the 3 hr time change, it's now 9pm in New York. In fact, we have been touched down for the past 30 minutes but there isn't room for us to board our terminal. From here, I need to take a train from Grand Central up to Connecticut and the last train is at 10:02pm--I simply won't make it.

I have no family or friends that can pick me up. I have no other means of getting home. Who do I talk to? I need either a hotel for the night, or a rental car. Even then, I still feel like Delta should *at least* pay for my rental car home or train ticket tomorrow.

"2015-09-09 22:24:26"|"Am I the only one here that has never had a problem with United?"|"Type ""United"" into the search bar and the only thing you'll find are posts complaining about bad experiences with them, one going as far as calling them ""Comcast of the Sky"". This comes as a surprise to me seeing as I fly with them several times a year and have always had pleasant experiences. (Well, not pleasant, but no worse than any other US Airline.) 

My home airport is Dayton so going pretty much anywhere requires a connection in Chicago; a major airport for all three big airlines. (United and American in particular.) The two places I go every year are Gunnison/Crested Butte (via Denver) in the winter and Los Angeles in the spring, in addition to other places I may go once every few years. Going to Colorado is always on United and is almost always a breeze. The only time I ever had a problem was when my ORD-DEN flight was delayed by mechanical trouble and I ended up missing my connecting flight. However, upon my arrival in Denver we were met at the gate by a United representative who informed us that we had already been re-booked on the next flight and presented us with a voucher for a free night at a hotel near the airport as well as a $10 meal ticket for each of us.

 Going to Los Angeles in the spring usually involves flying either AA or Delta. Delta has been fine for the most part but flying on American more often than not becomes a complete pain in the ass. I don't think I've ever been on a AA flight out of O'Hare that wasn't delayed and their customer service completely sucks too. On my most recent trip, I flew from Burbank-Phoenix-Chicago-Dayton. In Phoenix, our flight was delayed an hour and-a-half. (Through no fault of AA, apparently someone threw up on the last flight and they had to vacuum the carpets or something.)   By the time we finally boarded, it became clear we were going to miss our flight to Dayton and would have to spend the night in Chicago. Upon landing, I expected a similar procedure as with United in Denver but coming out of the jet-bridge there was no one to be seen. Not even at the gate desk. We had to find our way to a re-booking kiosk and the seemingly thoroughly uninterested rep. on the other side took 30 minutes to get us onto the flight the next day and was ready to hang up before I asked about overnight accommodations. She curtly informed us that she couldn't do anything and we would have to go find a Customer Service staff member inside the airport. It was late at night, so there was no one at the dedicated customer service and most of the gates were empty too. We finally found two gate agents who were stuck there because the flight that was coming into their gate was delayed. (surprise!) We marched up and pretty much demanded that we be put up in a hotel and the agent, who to her credit was very polite and professional, said that she would need to phone her supervisor to approve. He pretty much just said ""yeah whatever, just give it to them"" and we were finally on our way to the hotel. (Whose bus took 45 minutes to pick us up.) 

During the ride, I thought back to people we had met at the re-booking kiosk who had also missed their Dayton flight. They struck me as the type that rarely flew and looked very unsure as to their best course of action. They were at the kiosk when we got there and were still trying to negotiate with the rep. on the phone when we left. I hoped that they too had managed to get into a hotel but thought it was more likely that AA just let them spend the night in the airport.

TL;DR I've never had a bad experience with United, and if you're ever departing from/transferring through O'Hare don't choose American Airlines."
"2017-01-22 21:01:41"|"delta removed my already selected seat (international flight)"|"I didn't fly Delta for a few years... Early this month I booked a delta international ticket. Typical price range for this route is about $800-1000, I paid $1500, departure is MAIN CABIN (U) and return flight is MAIN CABIN (X). 

The departure flight doesn't allow me to select seat at booking (directly at delta.com), but it allow me to choose seat for returning flight (31F) http://imgur.com/a/OZD6D

My departure is tomorrow (within 24 hours). When I tried to check in online, I noticed my selected seat for returned flight (mid Feb) was removed, and it doesn't give me option to select seat. I call delta, hold the line for 2.5 hours already and no sign it will be my turn any time soon.

I am just curious does it happened to you ""after you already select seat, it's get removed and you didn't get any notification""? are you aware if a customer purchase a higher class tier ticket have more privilege so they can cancel my seat?

Edit: finally got hold of Delta rep. She said 31F doesn't exist. I tried to explain to her, I chose that seat for return flight when booking the ticket, and I saw the seat in the seat map as I spoke (it just grey out, as most of the seat). She kept on saying she didn't see 31F in her seat map, and said ""if you can see it, why not go ahead to select it?. I explained to her it doesn't allow me to change. Then she said ""it's because it's not within 24 hours yet"". Then I ask why I am not allowed to select seat on the departure flight (within 24 hours). she then said let me talk to my supervisor. about 20 more minute wait, the phone was disconnected, not sure if it's technical difficult. I guess I am going to get to airport early, don't want to be get bumped because the seat is not assigned. "

Are there still luggage hold places in both Terminal 1 and 4? Or is there only 1 of them left?  - I believe my outbound flight leaves from  T1, so it makes sense to leave it at that one the luggage hold in T1. - Are these places outside the secure area? (Where exactly are they?) I'll need to get my bag from b. claim, and pick it up before my out bound flight to check it. 


2. How does the transportation between the terminals work? Is there just a tram? Is it safe to assume that if I arrive to T5, I'll pick up my luggage from T5 then transfering to the terminal with the luggage hold? 

3. Upon leaving NY, how much time do I realistically need to retrieve my bag from storage, check, and get through security to my gate for my outbound flight?  I know at home IAH, I can pretty reliably get through everything at the international terminal in an hour and half. I plan to be there at least 2 hours, but would it be wise to plan for extra time?

Our flights were canceled due to weather, which is understandable and out of anyone's control. The problem lies with the aftermath. The gate attendant didn't alert anyone of the cancellation, the boards were not updated, and we didn't receive any updates via text or email in a timely fashion. We received alerts to our phones that the flight was delayed, and at that point the flight was actually already canceled. So we waited in line to try to get rebooked for nearly an hour. When we made it to the desk we told the attendant where our final destination was, and told her that we didn't mind connecting through a different city if that was an option. She totally dismissed this idea and remained focused on getting us to our original connector (which we were already going to miss), saying that we needed to take ""baby steps"" to figure it all out. Her solution was to place us on standby on a flight to our original connecting city, and then placed us on standby on a flight from there to our final destination. We asked her what the odds of getting on either of the flights were, and she said ""probably zero percent"". So we missed the flight out. We were never offered a hotel voucher (we were not flying out of our home city), nor were we offered new flights for the next day. They basically just told us they couldn't get us to where we needed to go.   No vouchers, no refunds, no rental car, no seats from another airline.
